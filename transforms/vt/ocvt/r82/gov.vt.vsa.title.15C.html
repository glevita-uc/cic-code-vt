        Trial court did not err in denying the mother's motion to dismiss appellee's de facto parentage petition, as the adjudication did not undermine a New Mexico parentage decision addressing biological parentage and the de facto parentage statute contained no time limit on when such a petition had to be filed.

        Trial court properly found appellee, who was the biological father of the child's sister, to be a de facto parent, as he had lived with and parented the child for at least four to five years even if the period of his drug addiction was excluded, the fact that the parties had lived with appellee's parents did not negate his own financial contributions, he was the only father figure the child had known, and the trial court found him to be a positive force in the child's life as long as he was addressing his mental health and maintaining sobriety, which he was doing.

        Trial court properly held that plaintiff, who had been in an polyamorous relationship with a child's parents, was not the child's de facto parent, as it found that plaintiff did not undertake full and permanent parental responsibilities and had not established a parental relationship with the child because she only watched the child on a set schedule while the mother was at work and voluntarily left the home when the father was forced to leave; that plaintiff did not hold out the child as her own because the parties kept the nature of the relationship secret and the child called plaintiff by her first name; and that continuing plaintiff's relationship with the child was not in his best interests due to the controlling nature of the father's and plaintiff's relationship with the mother and its negative effect on the child.
