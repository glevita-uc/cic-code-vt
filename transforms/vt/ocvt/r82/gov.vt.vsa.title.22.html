      Because the desire for the services provided by libraries transcends governmental boundaries and can most effectively be satisfied by giving such services to communities and people regardless of jurisdictional lines, it is the policy of the states party to this compact to cooperate and share their responsibilities; to authorize cooperation and sharing with respect to those types of library facilities and services which can be more economically or efficiently developed and maintained on a cooperative basis, and to authorize cooperation and sharing among localities, states and others in providing joint or cooperative library services in areas where the distribution of population or of existing and potential library resources make the provision of library service on an interstate basis the most effective way of providing adequate and efficient service.

        Trust providing for mandatory annual payment to town library, and also providing that trustees "may" pay over unexpended trust balance each year upon request of library, did not conflict with provision of subsection (a) of this section giving public trustees of a town library full power to manage the library and receive and manage property coming into the town's hands for the library's use, as the public trustees of the library had power over library funds only after the money came into the town's hands, while the trust's trustees had no control of the trust money after it was paid to the library.

     In the chapter heading, deleted "Division" following "Public Records" in light of Executive Order No. 35-87 (No. 3-11), which provided for the abolition of the public records division and the transfer of the duties, responsibilities and authority of that entity to the department of general services as established by the order. By its own terms, Executive Order No. 35-87
    (No. 3-11) took effect on July 1, 1987, pursuant to section 2002 of Title 3. For the text of Executive Order No. 35-87
    (No. 3-11), see chapter 3 of Title 3 Appendix. Executive Order No. 35-87 (No. 3-11), which this note refers to, was revoked and rescinded by E.O.06-05 (No. 3-46).

      A Board of Libraries, referred to in this chapter as "the Board", is established. The Board shall serve in an advisory capacity to the State Librarian. The Board shall consist of seven members appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate. At the time of appointment of the initial Board, one member shall be appointed for a term of one year, two members for terms of two years, two for three years, and two for four years. Thereafter, all appointments shall be for a term of four years. The Governor may appoint a member to replace any member of the Board who dies or resigns, to serve for the balance of the unexpired term of office. No person shall be appointed to the Board for more than two full terms, consecutive or otherwise. In making appointments to the Board, the Governor shall, as the Governor finds feasible, consult with educational officials, librarians and library administrators, the Vermont Bar Association, or other segments of the population.

      Any qualified person desiring to conduct any type of exploration or recovery operations, in the course of which any underwater historic property or part thereof may be removed, displaced, or destroyed, shall first make application to the State Historic Preservation Officer for a permit to conduct the operations. The State Historic Preservation Officer, with the advice of the State Archaeologist, may grant the applicant a permit for such a period of time and under such conditions as he or she may deem to be in the best interest of the State. The permit may provide for the fair compensation to the permittee in terms of a percentage of the reasonable cash value of the objects recovered or a fair share of the objects recovered, the fair compensation or share to be determined by the State Archaeologist. Superior title to all objects recovered shall be retained by the State unless or until they are released to the permittee by the State Archaeologist. All exploration and recovery operations undertaken under a permit issued under this section shall be carried out under the general supervision of the State Archaeologist and in such manner that the maximum amount of historic, scientific, archaeological, and educational information may be recovered and preserved in addition to the physical recovery of items. Permits may be renewed upon or prior to expiration. Holders of permits shall be responsible for obtaining permission of any federal agencies having jurisdiction prior to conducting any recovery operations.
