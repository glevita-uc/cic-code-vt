       One or more shareholders may create a voting trust, conferring on a trustee the right to vote or otherwise act for them, by signing an agreement setting out the provisions of the trust (which may include anything consistent with its purpose) and transferring their shares to the trustee. When a voting trust agreement is signed, the trustee shall prepare a list of the names and addresses of all owners of beneficial interests in the trust, together with the number and class of shares each transferred to the trust, and deliver copies of the list and agreement to the corporation's principal office.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c07sub03s7.30ol1b">
       A voting trust becomes effective on the date the first shares subject to the trust are registered in the trustee's name. A voting trust is valid for not more than 10 years after its effective date unless extended under subsection (c) of this section.

      <li id="t11c07sub03s7.30ol1c">
       All or some of the parties to a voting trust may extend it for additional terms of not more than 10 years each by signing an extension agreement and obtaining the voting trustee's written consent to the extension. An extension is valid for 10 years from the date the first shareholder signs the extension agreement. The voting trustee must deliver copies of the extension agreement and list of beneficial owners to the corporation's principal office. An extension agreement binds only those parties signing it.

        Where a bank obtained title to real property via a deed in lieu of foreclosure, any absence of notice, as required by former 11 V.S.A. 2002 (repealed in 1994), of the meeting of the shareholders of the original owner of the property, at which the resolution authorizing transfer of the property was adopted by the majority owners, was harmless, as the minority shareholders could not have prevented foreclosure, nor could they have affected the amount of proceeds credited to the shareholders as a result of the sale. Samplid Enterprises, Inc. v. First Vermont Bank, 165 Vt. 22, 676 A.2d 774 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sale of all corporate assets is valid only when the two-thirds shareholder assent required by former section 2002 of Title 11 is given. Hospitality Inns, Inc. v. South Burlington R.I., Inc., 153 Vt. 410, 571 A.2d 40 (1989). (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Two-thirds shareholder approval requirement of former section 2002 of Title 11 allowed a minority of shareholders to weigh their own interests without constraints and to vote accordingly. Hospitality Inns, Inc. v. South Burlington R.I., Inc., 153 Vt. 410, 571 A.2d 40 (1989). (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Sale of corporate assets was subject to two-thirds shareholder approval even though shareholders had approved a liquidation plan under section 337 of the Internal Revenue Code; approval of liquidation did not change the corporation's business to its own liquidation and divest minority shareholders of protection of section 2002 of Title 11.

        Trial court in dissenters' rights action did not err in relying exclusively on testimony of dissenters' expert in valuing corporation's shares and rejecting testimony of corporation's expert, where use of discounted-cash-flow valuation method was within court's discretion, growth and discount rates employed were reasonable, and elimination of extraordinary nonrecurring expenses was a generally-accepted adjustment for business valuation; court's finding that fair value of stock was $63.44 per share was thus supported by evidence and not clearly erroneous.

        Trial court in dissenters' rights action did not err in applying a thirty percent "control premium" to corporation's shares, to account for value of control in owning resort complex as a whole, where premium was used to adjust a valuation that reflected publicly traded minority interests, and evidence supported court's finding that thirty percent was a reasonable figure. In re 75,629 Shares of Common Stock of Trapp Family Lodge, Inc., 169 Vt. 82, 725 A.2d 927 (1999).

       <p>
        A corporation which had failed to file an annual report and had received a notice of revocation from the secretary of state under former section 2063 of Title 11 had no authority to remain in the marketplace in the ordinary course, and had authority under former section 2056 of Title 11 only to wind up its affairs and liquidate, using a court of competent jurisdiction within the state, if it so chose, for that purpose; the corporation, as a dissolved corporation, could not obtain relief under chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code (11 U.S.C.

        701 et seq.) for the purpose of reorganization. In re Vermont Fiberglass, Inc., 38 B.R. 151 (Bankr. D. Vt. 1984). (Decided under prior law.)

        The court's decision to base share value on the company's 1992 financial performance, the approximate date of the trial and decision, rather than 1991, the date minority shareholder filed his complaint, was reasonable, as complete financial data were not available for 1993 or 1994. Moreover, the parties were invited to provide additional evidence of the company's financial performance in preceding years, and their failure to do so evidenced assent to the use of 1992 as the base year.

        The question of whether a corporation is doing business is essentially one of fact. Pennconn Enterprises v. Huntington, 148 Vt. 603, 538 A.2d 673 (1987). (Decided under prior law.)

        The most important indicator of whether a foreign corporation is doing business in another state is whether the acts are part of the functions for which the corporation was created. Pennconn Enterprises v. Huntington, 148 Vt. 603, 538 A.2d 673 (1987). (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>

        When a foreign corporation has reached the point in its activities that it is applying for governmental permits, the intent behind former section 2101 of Title 11 requires a finding that the corporation is doing business in Vermont. Pennconn Enterprises v. Huntington, 148 Vt. 603, 538 A.2d 673 (1987). (Decided under prior law.)

        Where certificate of authority had been obtained by foreign corporation prior to approval of performance bonds and receipt of authorization to commence performance but after contract had been signed, corporation was not foreclosed from bringing suit under former section 2120 of Title 11 since the mere signing of the contract did not constitute "doing business." Jerene Enterprises, Inc. v. Burlington Housing Authority, 363 F. Supp. 1380 (D. Vt. 1973). (Decided under prior law.)

        Though New Hampshire savings bank might have been doing some business in Vermont, it was not doing business when, in state of its domicile, it accepted note to be paid there and mortgage securing it on real estate in Vermont, and as to that transaction was not subject to limitations on right to sue imposed by section 2120 of Title 11. Siwooganock Guaranty Savings Bank v. Cushman, 109 Vt. 221, 195 A. 260 (1937). (Decided under prior law.)

        Fact that mortgage provided that mortgagee was to collect sums in trust to pay taxes, fire insurance premiums and assessments in New Hampshire, did not constitute doing business in Vermont so as to deprive mortgagee of right to maintain foreclosure suit under section 2120 of Title 11. Siwooganock Guaranty Savings Bank v. Cushman, 109 Vt. 221, 195 A. 260 (1937). (Decided under prior law.)

        Conditional sales agreement, entered into between Vermont buyer and Massachusetts seller engaged in interstate commerce but not licensed to do business in Vermont, which was accepted by seller in Massachusetts and was an isolated commercial transaction in Vermont merely incidental to seller's interstate business, was beyond the reach of former section 2120 of Title 11, so that seller's security interest was entitled to protection in Vermont court.

        Where foreign corporation was engaged in interstate commerce and its activities in Vermont were not so localized as to require it to register with Secretary of State to do business in Vermont or subject it to statutory door-closing penalty for failure to do so, corporation's contract action should not have been dismissed.

       </p>
       <p>
        Contract action barred by former section 2120 of Title 11 should not have been dismissed "with prejudice"; since foreign corporation would not be precluded by res judicata from litigating its claim in another state if it could obtain jurisdiction over the defendants, the words "with prejudice" would be stricken from the final judgment.

        A foreign corporation doing business in Vermont at the time it made a contract was precluded from enforcing the contract in Vermont courts unless it had procured a certificate of authority as required by former section 2101 of Title 11 before it entered into the contract. Pennconn Enterprises v. Huntington, 148 Vt. 603, 538 A.2d 673 (1987). (Decided under prior law.)

        By reason of former section 2120 of Title 11, a foreign corporation doing business in this State which had not obtained a certificate of authority as required by former section 691 of Title 11 could not use the Vermont courts to institute an action on a contract made by the corporation in Vermont.

        Leases signed by lessees in Vermont and then returned to New Jersey for acceptance by lessor were not made in Vermont under former section 2120 of Title 11, as the place of contract was where the last act essential to completion was done, and acceptance in New Jersey was the last act in completion of the contract.

        Vermont may not require a national bank to register as a foreign corporation before it maintains a lawsuit in court within the State; such requirements plainly conflict with statute and were therefore preempted. A national bank is an instrumentality of the federal government, created for a public purpose, and as such necessarily subject to the paramount authority of the United States. Citibank N.A. v.

        Stockholders being the owners of the corporate property had the right to examine and inspect all the books and records of the corporation at all reasonable times, and former section 462 of Title 11 provided the method of enforcing that right. Lewis v. Brainerd, 53 Vt. 510 (1879). (Decided under prior law.)

        If books and records were not in the possession of clerk at the time of demand, it was his duty to explain why he could not exhibit them and to exhibit them within a reasonable time after their return. Lewis v. Brainerd, 53 Vt. 519 (1881). (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>
       <p>
        While the defendant would not be liable under former section 462 of Title 11 if it were physically impossible for him to exhibit the books because of their removal by the directors, the law exacted good faith in the discharge of defendant's duty and if he aided, assisted, or conspired with the directors in such removal, he would incur the penalty imposed by this section. Lewis v. Brainerd, 53 Vt. 519 (1881). (Decided under prior law.)

        In action to recover the penalty under former section 462 of Title 11, the ledger of the corporation was admissible into evidence to show that the ledger had been in the custody of the defendant at the time of the plaintiff's demand, to show that defendant made and kept entries of assessments and payments therein of the stockholders, that the plaintiff had notified the defendant that he had wanted to see whether certain assessments had been paid, and that the plaintiff had, afterwards, ascertained that the assessments which he had asked to see had not been paid, but the shares had been surrendered to, and accepted by, the corporation.

         4. Proper purpose.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Proper purpose for a shareholder's inspection of corporate records is a purpose that is reasonably relevant to one's interests as a shareholder, including valuation of shares, ascertaining possibility of mismanagement, and determining performance and condition of company. Towle v. Robinson Springs Corp., 168 Vt. 226, 719 A.2d 880 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Once a shareholder asserts a proper purpose for inspection of corporate records, burden then shifts to corporation to prove that an improper purpose is the primary purpose for inspection, or that the shareholder's request is made in bad faith. Towle v. Robinson Springs Corp., 168 Vt. 226, 719 A.2d 880 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's findings - that shareholder was entitled to inspect records related to value of corporation's stock, financial status of corporation, and claims of financial mismanagement - were adequately supported by record, and supported the court's ultimate conclusion that evidence presented by shareholder established that his reasons for seeking to inspect records were reasonably relevant to his interests as a shareholder. Towle v. Robinson Springs Corp., 168 Vt. 226, 719 A.2d 880 (1998).

Upon determining the fair value of such shares, the court shall set forth in its order directing that the shares be purchased, the purchase price and the time within which the payment shall be made, and may decree such other terms and conditions of sale as it determines to be appropriate, including payment of the purchase price in installments over a period of time and the allocation of shares among shareholders electing to purchase them.
