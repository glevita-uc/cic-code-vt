       <p>
        Although statute expressing preference for estates in common over joint tenancies did allow a deed to create a joint tenancy by explicit language, legislative policy required court to resolve ambiguity in favor of a tenancy in common rather than a joint tenancy. Kipp v. Chips Estate, 169 Vt. 102, 732 A.2d 127 (1999).

         2. Conveyance to two or more persons.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Under statute expressing legislature's preference for estates in common, court could find a joint tenancy only if intent to convey that interest was expressed in clear and definite terms, and therefore trial court correctly refused to admit evidence of circumstances surrounding drafting of deed, since even if extrinsic evidence was overwhelming that parties had intended to create a joint tenancy, that intent was inadequately expressed in deed to allow court to find such an interest. Kipp v. Chips Estate, 169 Vt. 102, 732 A.2d 127 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Children who took, jointly with their parents, an equitable estate became tenants in common therein. Thompson v. Tryon, 66 Vt. 191, 28 A. 873 (1894).
       </p>
       <p>
        A condition, in a deed to two or more persons, that they shall pay all the grantor's debts or the deed shall be void, did not create a trust estate or evince a design to create an estate in joint tenancy; the grantees held the estate as tenants in common. Lamb v. Clark, 29 Vt. 273 (1857).
       </p>
       <p>
        The deeding of a given number of acres to one man, and another number to another, thus conveying the whole right to both, there being nothing to show that the land was intended to be conveyed in severalty, will create a tenancy in common, and they will hold in common, in the proportion of the number of acres specified in their deeds. Preston v. Robinson & Ross, 24 Vt. 583 (1852).

         3. Conveyance of undivided interest.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        There is a statutory presumption that joint tenants will share equally. The trial court's finding that plaintiff intended to convey nothing was unsupported by the record, and was therefore insufficient to rebut the presumption; thus, the parties, upon the 1996 purchase of the property, each had an undivided one-half interest in the property. Massey v. Hrostek, 186 Vt. 211, 980 A.2d 768 (2009), overruled in part as stated in Whippie v. O'Connor, 2011 VT 97, 190 Vt. 600, 30 A.3d 1292.
       </p>
       <p>
        A deed which described land simply as so many acres of a certain lot, passed an undivided interest in such lot equal to the proportion which the number of acres sold bore to the whole number of acres in the lot. Sheafe v. Wait, 30 Vt. 735 (1858).

        The original purpose of the homestead exemption was the conservation of family homes. Estate of Giard v. Laird, 159 Vt. 508, 621 A.2d 1265 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of the homestead exemption is to protect homeownership from loss to creditors. Mercier v. Partlow, 149 Vt. 523, 546 A.2d 787 (1988).

       <p>
        Definition of a "homestead" in 27 V.S.A.
        §
        101 is an exemption concept and describes the rest that the state has carved out as being protected from execution by creditors; it has nothing to do with security interests. In re Mayer-Myers, 345 B.R. 127 (Bankr. D. Vt. June 15, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Vermont holds that: (1) the proportion of the Vermont homestead exemption available to a debtor is equal to the proportion of the debtor's ownership interest in the homestead; (2) a debtor's exemptible interest is equal to her equity, and equity is computed by subtracting the full amount of the debtor's liability for liens against the property from the value of the debtor's interest in the property; and (3) a co-tenant's prior bankruptcy filing and claim of exemption have no effect on the debtor's exemption rights. In re Norton, 327 B.R. 193 (Bankr. D. Vt. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        The word "thereof" in this section modifies "a dwelling house, outbuildings and land used in connection therewith . . . owned and used or kept" by a person as a homestead. In re Evans, 51 B.R. 47 (Bankr. D. Vt. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not vest in a natural person the absolute right to a homestead exemption, but is qualified by the words "except as hereinafter provided"; the exception is spelled out in section 107 of this title. In re Soter, 26 B.R. 838 (Bankr. D. Vt.), appeal dismissed, 31 B.R. 986 (D. Vt. 1983).

        Statutory homestead exemption, purpose of which was to protect homeownership from loss to creditors, did not apply in context of divorce, and therefore family court did not err by imposing $15,000 lien on mother's real estate in course of its division of marital property.

        Section 107 of this title does not fix the time for acquiring a homestead since the beginning words "such homestead" in the section presuppose the existence of a homestead which may be created and exempted under this section; rather, section 107 fixes the time at which existing causes of action shall make the homestead subject to attachment and levy of execution, i.e., the date of the filing of the deed on such homestead.

        Farmer who declared Chapter 7 bankruptcy was allowed to claim a homestead exemption under 27 V.S.A.
        §
        101 in a 3.69-acre parcel of land he used as his residence and to operate a wheatgrass business he owned, and because judicial liens an LLC and other creditors had placed on the property impaired the farmer's right to claim an exemption, they could be stripped off pursuant to 11 U.S.C.S.

In re Rommer, 549 B.R. 72 (Bankr. D. Vt. 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Creditor and trustee who objected to debtor's homestead exemption failed to sustain their burden under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4003 with respect to their request that the court limit the debtor's homestead exemption to a single parcel of land, or a portion of one parcel. Here, the record was unequivocal that the total value of both of the debtor's parcels was less than the allowable homestead exemption under 27 V.S.A.
        §
        101 and, under that law, the debtor was neither limited to one parcel nor subject to the carve out under 27 V.S.A
        <span class="s1">

        §
        101, the debtor's equity equaled the total amount due on the mortgage less the value of her one-half interest. The co-tenant's prior bankruptcy filing and claim of exemption had no effect on the debtor's exemption rights. In re Norton, 327 B.R. 193 (Bankr. D. Vt. 2005).

       <p>
        The homestead law does not vest any title to the homestead in the wife of the legal and general owner during his lifetime, but only a contingent and inchoate right which, if not released or otherwise barred, may be enforced if the wife survives him.

        One could not have a homestead in mere land; nor in land with no buildings but a barn on it; a dwelling house, owned, used, or kept as a home, was the first essential of a homestead. Rice v. Rudd, 57 Vt. 6 (1885).

        Plaintiff, an unmarried man, having bought, improved and kept a piece of land, with a building thereon, with intention of making a dwelling for himself and mother, acquired a homestead. Pierce v. Kusic, 56 Vt. 418 (1883); Hyser v. Mansfield, 72 Vt. 71, 47 A. 105 (1899).

       </p>
       <p>
        That defendant deeded to his brother his interest in the house; that he gathered materials to build another house; that he filed his petition to have a homestead set out from another part of premises; that he lived for several years in several different towns - were actions inconsistent with the idea that he was keeping the premises for a homestead. Whiteman v. Field, 53 Vt. 554 (1881).
       </p>
       <p>
        To acquire a homestead in premises, they must be used or kept for a family home; and it could not be gained by a mere intention to occupy them at some indefinite future time; there must be a present use of the premises or the keeping of them for that purpose with a present right to use them.

        Where claimant of homestead exemption owned two buildings, both located on a single piece of property, and rented one and resided in the other, the homestead exemption was applicable only to the building in which the debtor resided, and not the entire property, notwithstanding the fact that the property could not be subdivided; subdivision is not crucial to the protection for the homestead exemption of the debtor.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When an execution is levied upon real estate of the person of which a homestead is a part or upon that part of a homestead in excess of the limitation of $125,000.00 in value, that person may designate and choose the part thereof, not exceeding the limited value, to which the exemption created in section 101 of this title shall apply. Upon designation and choice or refusal to designate or choose, the officer levying the execution, if the parties fail to agree upon appraisers, shall appoint three disinterested freeholders of the vicinity who shall be sworn by him or her and who shall fix the location and boundaries of the homestead to the amount of $125,000.00 in value. The officer shall then proceed with the sale of the residue of the real estate on the execution as in other cases, and the doings in respect to the homestead shall be stated in the return upon the execution.

        Creditor and trustee who objected to debtor's homestead exemption failed to sustain their burden under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 4003 with respect to their request that the court limit the debtor's homestead exemption to a single parcel of land, or a portion of one parcel. Here, the record was unequivocal that the total value of both of the debtor's parcels was less than the allowable homestead exemption under 27 V.S.A.
        §
        101 and, under that law, the debtor was neither limited to one parcel nor subject to the carve out under 27 V.S.A.
        <span class="s1">
         §
        </span>
        102 since that carve out applied only to situations where the value of the debtor's interest exceeded the applicable monetary limit. In re Mead, 489 B.R. 363 (Bankr. D. Vt. 2013).

        The surviving spouse's right of homestead is of such paramount importance that it is regarded as a restraint upon the exercise of another fundamental right - that of testamentary disposition, and it is beyond dispute that any effort to will away such a right must fail. Budde v. Pierce, 135 Vt. 152, 375 A.2d 984 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where divorce decree required husband to make a will leaving his real estate to the minor children of the parties, and at time of his death, husband was remarried but had not yet complied with the provisions of the divorce decree, having made no testamentary disposition whatever of the subject real estate, even if divorce decree was a binding and valid contract to devise real estate, its specific enforcement could not affect the rights of the widow of a party to that contract from her statutory claims to a portion of the estate. Budde v. Pierce, 135 Vt. 152, 375 A.2d 984 (1977).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Upon decease of husband, the homestead vests in surviving spouse and it becomes duty of probate court having jurisdiction of estate, when necessary, to appoint commissioners to set the same out; it does not depend, however, on contingency of being set out; it is consummated by husband's death. In re Estate of Cooke, 117 Vt. 336, 91 A.2d 683 (1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        Homestead right does not become a fixed and definite estate in land until it is ascertained and set out; before it is ascertained and set out, it is nothing more than a contingent or inchoate right - a conditional lien or encumbrance. Cole v. Cole, 117 Vt. 354, 91 A.2d 819 (1952).

       <p>
        Where husband failed to perform his part of antenuptial contract as to paying during his lifetime, widow was entitled to homestead; because homestead by force of this section vests in the widow on the death of the husband; and the contract, being a release or discharge of something not in existence at the time it was given, cannot defeat this right. Mann v. Mann's Estate, 53 Vt. 48 (1880).

        Antenuptial covenant not to claim a homestead was executory and could only be enforced by a court of general equity powers. Mann v. Mann's Estate, 53 Vt. 48 (1880).

       <p>
        The homestead interest is a statutory right, created by operation of law only at the death of a spouse, and the statute does not contemplate transfer or waiver of this interest before it vests; therefore, a husband did not convey, by a second quitclaim deed, his homestead interest to his wife. In re Estate of Mainolfi, 178 Vt. 588, 878 A.2d 287 (mem.) (June 1, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        In absence of express or implied intention on part of testator that his widow should elect between her lawful rights in his property and provisions made for her in his will, she shall take both, and he who asserts that testator intended provisions made for her to be in lieu of her marital rights in his estate has burden of proving that fact beyond reasonable doubt. In re Estate of Taylor, 110 Vt. 80, 2 A.2d 317 (1938).

        Court found no reason not to construe plainly the plain language of 27 V.S.A.
        §
        107, "liability of homestead for debts," which was premised on there actually being a debt due on the date that debtors acquired the property. In order to obtain the benefits of the shield created by 27 V.S.A.
        <span class="s1">
         §
        </span>
        107, the burden was on the creditor to establish that it had a "debt" existing when the homestead was acquired, and it failed to do; therefore, enforcement of its judgment was subject to, and limited by, debtors' homestead exemption under 27 V.S.A.
        <span class="s1">

        101. In re Bourgault, - B.R. - (Bankr. D. Vt. Mar. 30, 2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        The phrase "causes of action existing" as used in this section includes debts existing when the homestead was acquired; the wording is not limited to debts on which the creditor can bring suit - that is, debts that have gone into default. Weale v. Lund, 180 Vt. 551, 904 A.2d 1191 (mem.) (July 7, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not fix the time for acquiring a homestead since the beginning words "such homestead" in the section presuppose the existence of a homestead which may be created and exempted under section 101 of this title; rather, this section fixes the time at which existing causes of action shall make the homestead subject to attachment and levy of execution, i.e., the date of the filing of the deed on such homestead.

        Avoidance of creditor's lien on debtor's property pursuant to 11 U.S.C.S.
        §
        522(f) was not warranted because debtor's persistent use of the property during the period when his LLC held legal title to the property did not meet the demanding criteria established for equitable title under Vermont law; when debtor acquired the property, he acquired it subject to the creditor's lien, by operation of this statute. In re Hewitt, 576 B.R. 790 (Bankr. D. Vt. 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Chapter 7 debtor was allowed under 11 U.S.C.S.
        §
        522(f) to avoid a judgment lien a bank placed on a house the debtor purchased after he agreed to surrender the marital home to his wife in a divorce action because the lien impaired a homestead exemption the debtor was allowed to claim under Vermont law on his new home. The debtor was allowed under 27 V.S.A.
        <span class="s1">
         §
        </span>
        109 to protect equity he had in his new home if he acquired the new home with funds derived from a prior homestead, and IRA funds he used to purchase the new home were part of the consideration he received from the disposition of his former homestead because they were part of a global equitable distribution of marital property the state court approved; it did not matter that the debtor obtained a home equity loan on his new home shortly after he purchased the home and used the money to replace funds he took from his IRA. In re Patterson, 482 B.R. 755 (Bankr. D. Vt. 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because a Chapter 7 debtor had no interest in certain real property prior to when a creditor's judgment lien attached to the property, she had no right to avoid the lien under 11 U.S.C.S.
        §

        <span class="s1">

     <p>
      When a person acquires a new homestead, the prior homestead shall be liable for his or her debts and may be conveyed by him or her like other real estate.
    Such new homestead shall not be liable for causes of action against him or her to which such prior homestead would not have been liable, if such new homestead is acquired with the consideration derived from the sale or other disposition of such prior homestead, or with other means not derived from the property of such person.

        §
        141(a), absent circumstances not present here, unless both a husband and a wife joined in the execution and acknowledgement of a conveyance of a homestead interest, such conveyance was inoperative. Here, debtors were married at the time the wife executed the mortgage, and the husband did not join in the execution of the mortgage; therefore, applying the rules set forth in this statute to these facts leads categorically to the conclusion that the conveyance was inoperative. Orcutt v. GMAC Mortg., LLC (In re Orcutt), - B.R. - (Bankr. D. Vt. Feb. 24, 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        As debtor extinguished any right she retained in her husband's property prior to her filing for bankruptcy relief, by abandoning this property and claiming another property as her homestead, debtor had no marital property interest which she might either claim as exempt or utilize to void the transfer to defendant. Pierce v. Pierce (In re Pierce), - B.R. - (Bankr. D. Vt. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        A widow's assertion of irregularities in transactions involving advances on a home equity loan that occurred during her first marriage to her husband should have been raised prior to her divorce when she still had an inchoate interest; once that interest was extinguished by divorce, the conveyance was no longer voidable. Charter One Bank v. Estate of Spillane, 174 Vt. 490, 807 A.2d 452 (mem.) (2002).

        Rule that a deed to a homestead property, executed by only one spouse, is void ab initio is abandoned; such a conveyance is ineffective with respect to the spouse who did not join it and may be set aside by that spouse unless the homestead interest is otherwise extinguished.

       </p>

        Homestead act protected husband as well as wife and children; and husband's sole deed of homestead was void and was in no way rendered effective by subsequent death of wife leaving him without children.

       </p>
       <p>
        The sole deed of a husband of his homestead not worth more than maximum homestead limitations was void. Day v. Adams, 42 Vt. 510 (1869); Cushman v. Davis, 79 Vt. 111, 64 A. 456 (1906); First National Bank v. Bertoli, 88 Vt. 421, 92 A. 970 (1915).

       <p>
        Mortgage against real property of spouses was not invalid based on the lack of one spouse's signature on the mortgage, since the spouses conveyed their interests in the property to one spouse who subsequently signed the mortgage to allow merger of properties and, pursuant to 27 V.S.A.

        141(d), the conveyance divested the non-signing spouse of such spouse's homestead interest in the property. Muther v. Citimortgage, Inc. (In re Muther), 479 B.R. 316 (Bankr. D. Vt. Sept. 28, 2012).

       <p>
        Although a wife who declared Chapter 13 bankruptcy with her husband ("debtors") had the right under 27 V.S.A.
        §
        141 to avoid a mortgage an LLC held on the debtors' homestead because the LLC did not require the wife to sign a mortgage the husband signed when he borrowed money from the LLC to pay debts that were secured by the property, the court had the power under the doctrine of equitable subordination to grant the LLC an equitable lien on the debtors' homestead to secure a portion of a debt in the amount of $153,359 the husband owed, and found that the LLC was entitled to an equitable lien in the amount of $91,851, which included the amount of the loan the debtors used to pay off an existing mortgage and taxes they owed. Jones v. Nationstar Mortg., LLC (In re Jones), 534 B.R. 588 (Bankr. D. Vt. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was clear error for a bankruptcy court to hold a Vermont statute controlled and rendered a mortgage inoperative, when both spouses did not sign the mortgage, because the court used the claims allowance process in 11 U.S.C.S.
        §
        506(a) as a basis for the court's authority to adjudicate the mortgage's validity. GMAC Mortg., LLC v. Orcutt, 506 B.R. 52 (D. Vt. 2014).

       <p>
        Bankruptcy court found that it had jurisdiction to resolve an adversary proceeding Chapter 13 debtors filed against an LLC, which claimed that a mortgage the LLC held was invalid under 27 V.S.A.
        §
        141, because a determination of the validity of the LLC's mortgage was essential and integral to a determination of the LLC's secured status under 11 U.S.C.S.

       When the spouse of an owner of a homestead lacks capacity to protect his or her interests due to a mental condition or psychiatric disability and the owner desires to convey it or an interest therein, he or she may petition the Probate Division of the Superior Court in the district in which the homestead is situated for a license to convey the same. Upon not less than 14 days' notice of the petition to the kindred of the spouse who lacks capacity to protect his or her interests due to a mental condition or psychiatric disability residing in the State, and to the selectboard members of the town in which the homestead is situated, which notice may be personal or by publication, the court may hear and determine the petition and may license the owner or convey the homestead, or an interest therein, by his or her sole deed. The license shall be recorded in the office where a deed of the homestead is required to be recorded and the sole deed shall have the same effect as if the spouse has the capacity to protect his or her interests and had joined therein.
      </li>

      When a dwelling house, outbuildings, and lands in which a homestead right exists exceed in value $125,000.00 and a severance of the homestead would greatly depreciate the value of the residue of the premises or be of great inconvenience to the parties interested either in the residue or in the homestead, either party may apply for relief to the Superior Court by a complaint setting forth the facts.

       <p>
        Interest or estate in land created orally was a tenancy at will. Toussaint v. Stone, 116 Vt. 425, 77 A.2d 824 (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        An attempt to transfer an interest in lands without an instrument in writing is of no force or effect under the provisions of this section. Rutland County National Bank v. Swyer, 113 Vt. 485, 35 A.2d 658 (1944).
       </p>
       <p>
        An oral assignment of a written lease of real estate for years created only a tenancy at will. Abbot v. Lapoint, 82 Vt. 246, 73 A. 166 (1909).
       </p>
       <p>
        A tenant at will had no interest that he could convey, and an attempt to convey ended his tenancy. Abbot v. Lapoint, 82 Vt. 246, 73 A. 166 (1909).

         2. Holding over after expiration of lease.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where defendants commenced, under a parol lease, to occupy plaintiff's premises at an agreed rent of $45 per month, and later he notified them that if they continued after a certain month they must pay $60 per month, the tenancy was at will and the notice terminated it, and plaintiff was entitled to recover $60 per month after such month, on an implied promise. Amsden v. Floyd & Blaisdell, 60 Vt. 386, 15 A. 332 (1888).
       </p>
       <p>
        An estate at will was converted into a tenancy from year to year by the payment of rent; and the conversion was wrought, not by the length of time that the tenant held and paid rent, but by the fact that the tenant entered and held under a stipulation to pay annual rent, and paid accordingly. Silsby v. Allen, 43 Vt. 172 (1870).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a tenant for a fixed term of years or for a year under a formal written lease holds over after the expiration of the term, with the consent or acquiescence of the landlord, a tenancy by implication arises; this begins as a tenancy at will, but, when the landlord accepts the rent, it may and usually does ripen into a tenancy from year to year; in either case the tenant holds the premises subject to all the covenants and conditions of the original lease, without any stipulation or bargain to that effect. Barlow v. Wainwright, 22 Vt. 88 (1849); Hall v. Wadsworth, 28 Vt. 410 (1856); Sartwell v. Sowles, 72 Vt. 270, 48 A. 11 (1900); Maniatty v. Carroll Co., 114 Vt. 168, 41 A.2d 144 (1945); Bergeron v. Forger, 125 Vt. 207, 214 A.2d 85 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a tenancy, which was in its inception an estate at will only, became a tenancy from year to year, the tenant could not at any time during the year at pleasure surrender the premises against the will of the landlord and thus excuse himself from the payment of accruing rent. Barlow v. Wainwright, 22 Vt. 88 (1849).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        A written statement by a trustee fulfills the requirement of this section that trusts concerning lands must be created or declared in writing. Mahoney v. Leddy, 126 Vt. 98, 223 A.2d 456 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        An unequivocal declaration by the settlor is necessary to establish a trust where the settlor constitutes himself trustee for another and thereby changes the nature of his ownership of the property, but is not necessary where the settlor transfers legal title to another who thereafter acknowledges that beneficial ownership remained with the settlor. Mahoney v. Leddy, 126 Vt. 98, 223 A.2d 456 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        The requirements of this section that a trust be in writing are satisfied by a bill of complaint signed by one in the position of trustee. Miele v. Miele, 124 Vt. 110, 197 A.2d 787 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any instrument, which sufficiently defines object and terms of trust, signed by either person who creates trust or person who declares it, meets requirements of this section. Straw v. Mower, 99 Vt. 56, 130 A. 687 (1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        Grantee in a deed which was absolute in its terms and contained no recital of a trust interest, was as much chargeable as trustee by her acknowledgment of the trust in an answer to a bill in chancery brought against her, as though the deed contained an express declaration of the trust. Barron v. Barron, 24 Vt. 375 (1852).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section did not require that creation of a trust in lands should be by writing, but simply that it be manifested and proved by some writing. Pinney v. Fellows, 15 Vt. 525 (1843).
       </p>
       <p>
        Deposition of the trustee, subscribed and sworn to by him, fully proving the trust, was a sufficient manifestation and proof of it, in writing, in a suit between the cestui que trust and an attaching creditor of the trustee. Pinney v. Fellows, 15 Vt. 525 (1843).

        A trust is implied whenever the circumstances are such that the person taking the legal estate, whether by fraud or otherwise, cannot enjoy the beneficial interest without violating the rules of honesty and fair dealing. Lorenz v. Rowley, 122 Vt. 480, 177 A.2d 364 (1962).

        Where real estate was conveyed to grantor's daughter and son-in-law upon an express oral trust for the benefit of his grandchildren, but to be performed only upon his death during the continuance of his then illness, and he later recovered so that the trust could not be accomplished, common honesty required that the legal title should be given back to the grantor, and grantees then held property as constructive trustees for grantor. Vilas v. Seith, 108 Vt. 526, 189 A. 862 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        A resulting trust could not be raised by any transactions between the parties subsequent to the passing of the legal title, but it was not necessary that the entire purchase money should have been paid at time of conveyance; it was enough if the one setting up the trust assumed to pay as a part of the original transaction and subsequently did pay the consideration. Barber v. Thompson, 49 Vt. 213 (1876); Williams v. Wagner, 64 Vt. 326, 24 A. 765 (1892).
       </p>
       <p>
        To create a resulting trust, or trust by implication of law, the purchase money, or some part of it, must have been paid by the plaintiff at the time of purchase, or been paid from his funds; it was not sufficient that it was paid to defendant after purchase, or to a third person in payment of the securities given by defendant at time of purchase. Pinnock v. Clough, 16 Vt. 500 (1844).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where one buys land in the name of another, and pays the consideration money, the land will generally be held by the grantee in trust for the person who paid the consideration. Pinney v. Fellows, 15 Vt. 525 (1843); Barron v. Barron, 24 Vt. 375 (1852); Dewey v. Dewey, 35 Vt. 555 (1863); Williams v. Wagner, 64 Vt. 326, 24 A. 765 (1892).

        Where a husband paid the purchase price of real estate, and caused the same to be deeded to his wife under a mutual understanding that she should hold the legal title in trust for him, a trust resulted by implication of law, for the presumption that the transaction was intended as a gift to the wife was rebutted by evidence of the understanding. Bickford v. Estate of Bickford, 68 Vt. 525, 35 A. 471 (1896).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence of a resulting trust must be clear and satisfactory, but by this it was only meant that the trier of the case must be reasonably satisfied of the fact which the evidence tended to prove. Williams v. Wagner, 64 Vt. 326, 24 A. 765 (1892).

        When a grantor transferred real property to his then girlfriend, who transferred it to her son after the relationship ended, the statute of frauds did not prevent the grantor from presenting evidence of an alleged oral agreement that the girlfriend would reconvey the property to him. Such evidence could be used not to enforce the terms of the alleged agreement, but to support the grantor's assertion that the girlfriend and son were unjustly enriched and that he was entitled to the imposition of a constructive trust.

        In arguing that if the original developer wanted to obtain consent for development he had to execute and record a power of attorney rather than embed a consent provision in the declaration, a condominium association's reliance on the statute regarding conveyances effected through power of attorney was misplaced. The declaration of condominium provisions did not allow developers to convey the unit owners' real estate. Madowitz v. the Woods at Killington Owners' Ass'n, 188 Vt. 197, 6 A.3d 1117 (2010).

         It was not essential to validity of deed of real estate of a corporation that it should recite vote of the corporation authorizing their agent to execute the deed. McDaniels v. Flower Brook Manufacturing Co., 22 Vt. 274 (1850).

         Reasonable and straightforward reading of the statute leads to the conclusion that the term "defective acknowledgment" in 27 V.S.A.
         §
         348(b), includes the defects listed in
         <span class="s1">

          §

         348(b) includes both missing and invalid acknowledgments. Warner v. Citifinancial, Inc. (In re Warner), 446 B.R. 651 (Bankr. D. Vt. 2011).

        <p>
         Vermont legislature began 27 V.S.A.
         §
         348(b) with the clause "notwithstanding subsection (a)". The court interpreted the notwithstanding clause to mean the legislature intended to shorten the window in which a challenge could be brought against written documents affecting an interest in real property, perhaps in an effort to provide earlier certainty and finality to written documents affecting title to real property. Warner v. Citifinancial, Inc. (In re Warner), 446 B.R. 651 (Bankr. D. Vt. 2011).
        </p>
        <p>
         Although debtors' complaint accurately alleged that the subject mortgage did not meet the acknowledgement requirements for a mortgage on a homestead property owned jointly by a husband and wife, it failed to set forth grounds for relief in that this defect had been cured by the passage of time under 27 V.S.A.
         §
         348. Since the written instrument in question affected real property and had a "defective acknowledgment," it fell squarely under
         <span class="s1">
          §
         </span>
         348(b) and automatically became valid three years after it was recorded. Warner v. Citifinancial, Inc. (In re Warner), 446 B.R. 651 (Bankr. D. Vt. 2011).
        </p>
        <p>
         In enacting 27 V.S.A.
         §
         348(b)(1), the Vermont legislature intended to allow properly recorded, written instruments affecting real property that were defective, due, inter alia, to a missing acknowledgment or an invalid acknowledgment, to become valid instruments if not challenged within three years. More than three years passed between the date the subject mortgage was recorded and the date debtors initiated a legal challenge to it; accordingly, under
         <span class="s1">
          §
         </span>
         348(b)(1), the subject mortgage was valid, notwithstanding the lack of a statutorily required acknowledgment. Warner v. Citifinancial, Inc. (In re Warner), 446 B.R. 651 (Bankr. D. Vt. 2011).

      When a grantor or lessor dies or leaves the state without acknowledging his deed, the execution thereof may be proved by the testimony of a subscribing witness thereto before a justice of the supreme court, a superior judge or a judge of the superior court.
    If all the subscribing witnesses to such deed are dead or out of the state, the same may be proved before the supreme or superior court by proving the handwriting of the grantor or lessor and of a subscribing witness or adducing other evidence to the satisfaction of such court.
    Such evidence entered on such deed or annexed thereto shall be equivalent to the grantor's or lessor's acknowledgment thereof.

      A person interested in a deed or lease not acknowledged may cause the deed or lease to be recorded without acknowledgment before or during the application to the court, or the proceedings before any of the authorities named in sections 371-376 of this title; and, when so recorded in the proper office, it shall be as effectual as though the same had been duly acknowledged and recorded for 60 days thereafter. If such proceedings for proving the execution of the deed are pending at the expiration of such 60 days, the effect of such record shall continue until the expiration of six business days after the termination of the proceedings.

         1. Notice.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Statute setting forth the optional/obligatory advance doctrine is satisfied by any written notice and requires neither that the notice come from the junior creditor nor that the junior creditor specifically object to future advances. This is the natural meaning of the section as written, and a court will generally give a statute its plain meaning. Daniels v. Elks Club of Hartford, 192 Vt. 114, 58 A.3d 925 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Comparatively minimal statutory requirement in the statute setting forth the optional/obligatory advance doctrine - that the notice be written - appears to have the primary purpose of ensuring that mortgagees not be burdened with constantly monitoring for attachments before issuing advances, as they would be if record notice were sufficient to undermine priority. Accepting actual notice in the place of written notice does not undermine this purpose because it does not impose any additional burden upon the mortgagee; a mortgagee need not seek out information about attachments to ensure that its priority is preserved, but where it has received such information, it cannot expect to retain its priority. Daniels v. Elks Club of Hartford, 192 Vt. 114, 58 A.3d 925 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        In interpreting the statute setting forth the optional/obligatory advance doctrine to be satisfied by actual notice, the Vermont Supreme Court agrees that future advances made by a mortgagee will be subordinate if made after the mortgagee has actual notice of the intervening lien, and it aligns itself with the way that most states have construed the notice contained in the optional/obligatory advance doctrine. Advances do not get priority if there is credible evidence from disinterested witnesses to the effect that an officer of defendant bank had actual knowledge of the existence of a junior mortgage. Daniels v. Elks Club of Hartford, 192 Vt. 114, 58 A.3d 925 (2012).

        In order to change the character of property from chattel to real by annexation to the freehold, it must be attached in such a manner that it cannot be removed without permanent injury to the realty or to the property itself as a chattel. Kendall v. Hathaway, 67 Vt. 122, 30 A. 859 (1894).
       </p>
       <p>
        A cider mill and shingle mill standing on legs, and only held in place by belts which ran them, and a circular sawmill so attached to building that it could be removed without damage to itself or the building, were chattels. Kendall v. Hathaway, 67 Vt. 122, 30 A. 859 (1894).
       </p>
       <p>
        A waterwheel and shafting attached to a lumber mill in the usual manner retained their character as chattels in favor of a conditional vendor as against a prior mortgage; this was so although old machinery covered by the mortgage was taken out to make room for the new, and although the waterwheel could not be removed without destroying the penstock. Page v. Edwards, 64 Vt. 124, 23 A. 917 (1891).

       Within five business days after the mortgagee's receipt of a written request for a statement of the amount of funds or other obligations required to satisfy a note or other obligation secured by a mortgage, the mortgagee shall provide a written payoff statement to the mortgagor. The mortgagee shall not impose a fee or other charge for providing the payoff statement, unless the request specifically asks for expedited service. A request for a payoff statement shall include the name of the mortgagor, the loan number assigned to the loan, and the address of the property securing the loan. If a written payoff statement is not deposited in the U.S. mail, delivered to a courier service, sent by facsimile, or sent by other method of service customarily used for delivery of messages, within five business days after receiving the request, the holder and any servicer shall be jointly and severally liable to any aggrieved party in a civil action for statutory damages equal to $25.00 per day after the expiration of the five business days, up to an aggregate maximum of $5,000.00 for all aggrieved parties; provided, however, any servicer not authorized to issue a payoff statement shall not be liable as set forth herein.

      <li id="t27c05sub04a01a02s464ol1b">
       Within 30 days after full performance of the conditions of the mortgage, the mortgagee of record shall execute and deliver a valid and complete discharge as provided in sections 461-463 of this title, together with any instrument necessary to establish the mortgagee's record ownership of the mortgage and to establish the authority to execute the discharge. As used in this section, the term "mortgagee" shall mean both the holder of the mortgage at the time it is satisfied and any servicer who receives the final payment satisfying the debt. If a discharge is not executed and delivered within 30 days, the holder and any servicer shall be jointly and severally liable to any aggrieved party in a civil action for statutory damages equal to $25.00 per day after the expiration of the 30 days, up to an aggregate maximum of $5,000.00 for all aggrieved parties; provided, however, any servicer not authorized to execute such discharge shall not be liable as set forth in this subsection. With respect to a mortgagee securing an open-end line of credit, the 30-day period to deliver a discharge commences after the mortgagor delivers to the address designated for payments under the line of credit a written request to terminate the line of credit and mortgage, together with payment in full of all amounts secured by the mortgage.
      </li>
      <li id="t27c05sub04a01a02s464ol1c">
       The aggrieved party may file an action under subsection (a) or (b) of this section in superior court or, if the action is for monetary damages only and if the ad damnum requested is equal to or less than the maximum jurisdiction of a small claims proceeding, the complaint may be filed as a small claims action.
      </li>
      <li id="t27c05sub04a01a02s464ol1d">
       In addition to any statutory damages, the mortgagee shall also be liable for consequential damages, punitive damages, court costs, and reasonable attorney's fees to any aggrieved party who substantially prevails in an action under this section. An aggrieved party may file an action to recover such damages, costs and fees in superior court. The court shall equitably allocate punitive damages among multiple aggrieved parties and may grant such other relief as the court deems appropriate.

      When it appears from the record of a mortgage on real estate that such mortgage is undischarged, and the mortgagee therein named, or the person to whom such mortgage is assigned, is deceased, the owner of such real estate may make written application to the probate division of the superior court of the district within which such real estate is situated for the appointment of an administrator of the estate of such deceased mortgagee or assignee to discharge such mortgage.
    The probate division of the superior court may appoint an administrator of such deceased mortgagee or assignee to discharge such mortgage, if upon hearing and upon payment of the costs of such hearing, the administrator is satisfied that the conditions of such mortgage have been complied with and is further satisfied that there is no person within the state having authority to discharge such mortgage.

        Even though this section specifically rejects a retroactive application of the subchapter by stating that its provisions would apply only to wills and instruments taking effect after the enactment of the statute, the combined effect of the subchapter with a prior decision, which precluded collateral attacks on unappealed decrees, reformed the application of the rule against perpetuities in Vermont in already settled estates as well as in future instruments.

       <p>
        By definition, interests implied by operation of law, as easements by necessity are, do not fall within the statutory category of interests "granted . . . by a recorded instrument." To conclude otherwise would stretch the language of the statute beyond its plain meaning. Had the legislature intended to include among the interests that are not extinguished by the Marketable Record Title Act interests that arise by operation of law in the absence of a deeded right, it would have said so. Gray v. Treder, 209 Vt. 210, 204 A.3d 1117 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if an easement by necessity in favor of plaintiffs' lot arose in 1948, it was extinguished by the Marketable Record Title Act because it had remained unrecorded, as the exception to the act for interests "granted, excepted, or reserved by a recorded instrument" did not apply to interests implied by operation of law, such as easements by necessity.

     <p>
      An application for such an order and disposition of property may be made by any member of the Vermont Baptist State Convention when duly authorized thereto by the board of trustees or the executive committee of the board of trustees of the Vermont Baptist State Convention, or by any member of such church, upon a verified complaint setting forth the facts authorizing such order and disposition of property.
    Upon the presentation of such complaint to the superior court, such court may proceed in a summary manner, after such notice as the court may prescribe, to inquire into the merits of such application.
    If upon examination by the court it shall appear that the making of the order and disposition of the property applied for is necessary or proper for any of the causes mentioned in section 782 of this title, such court shall make a final order declaring such church extinct, or dissolving the same, and transferring any property, and the title and possession thereof which may belong to such church, or held in trust for such church, and vest the same in the Vermont Baptist State Convention, it being the intention and purpose of this section and sections 781 and 782 of this title to preserve to the Baptist denomination in this state, as represented by the Vermont Baptist State Convention, for religious uses all property owned by or held in trust for any such church.
    Such an order of transfer shall not be made if objected to by five or more members of such church.
    This section and sections 781 and 782 of this title shall not affect reversionary interests of any person or persons in such property or any valid legal liens of creditors thereon.

        Trial court did not err in failing to apply notice requirements of lost property statutes in case involving lost dog. Lamare v. North Country Animal League, 170 Vt. 115, 743 A.2d 598 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        From its plain terms and judicial application over time it is evident that the "lost property" statute -- which dates from the late-eighteenth and early-nineteenth centuries -- was designed for agricultural animals of substantial monetary value, not lost pets. Morgan v. Kroupa, 167 Vt. 99, 702 A.2d 630 (1997).

        In a declaration of condominium, the declarant clearly reserved to itself the right to expand the condominium up to the stated maximum number of 250 units and to adjust fractional ownership of the common facilities correspondingly.

        Plain language of the statute regarding common areas and facilities in condominiums does not contemplate a bar on procurement of prior consent to future development through embedding a power of attorney in the declaration. Madowitz v. the Woods at Killington Owners' Ass'n, 188 Vt. 197, 6 A.3d 1117 (2010).

       <p>
        Through the declaration of condominium, unit owners gave limited consent for developers to amend the declaration as they proceeded with a phased development plan to reflect each new change in the unit owners' undivided interests in the common areas and facilities. Though the statute regarding common areas and facilities in condominiums was later amended to prohibit the practice of obtaining prior consent to development in this manner, there was simply no way to construe the statute, as it appeared at the time the deeds of condominium were conveyed, as prohibiting this practice. Madowitz v. the Woods at Killington Owners' Ass'n, 188 Vt. 197, 6 A.3d 1117 (2010).

        Under plain language of 27 V.S.A.
        §§
        1302, 1306 and 1322, undeveloped land subject to a declaration of condominium was not the same as "common areas," and therefore undeveloped land could be taxed to developer separately from condominium owners. Layden v. City of Rutland, 169 Vt. 594, 737 A.2d 894 (mem.) (1999).

        Read in conjunction with the statute governing common profits and expenses for condominiums, common expenses are indeed assessed as part of the permanent property interest assigned in the statute governing common areas and facilities. Thus, a unanimous decision of unit owners was required to amend the formula for assessing common expenses. Arapaho Owners Ass'n, Inc. v. Alpert, 199 Vt. 553, 128 A.3d 397 (2015).

        Condominium association violated the terms of the amended declaration, the Condominium Ownership Act, and the Common Interest Ownership Act when it authorized dormer expansions that impacted commonly owned airspace without unanimous approval of the unit owners. While an expansion into the attic space from the unit immediately below did not alter the footprint of the unit, an allocation of a portion of the airspace to any individual unit resulted in a reallocation of that airspace from a common element to a part of a unit.
