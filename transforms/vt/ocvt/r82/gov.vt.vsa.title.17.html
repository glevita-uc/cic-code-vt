     §
    
    9, constituted a violation of equal protection, a fundamental right, the right to vote, was at stake, and the standard of review to be applied was that the discriminatory classification could be upheld only if it was necessary in the service of some compelling State interest. Kohn v. Davis, 320 F. Supp. 246 (D. Vt. 1970), aff'd, 405 U.S. 1034, 92 S. Ct. 1305, 31 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1972).

       <p>
        In an action for injunctive and declaratory relief, restraining operation of Vermont laws and officials, presenting the question whether a one year residency requirement for voting in all elections violated the Equal Protection Clause by preventing plaintiffs from exercising their fundamental right to vote, there was no presumption of constitutionality in defendants' favor, and defendants had the burden of proving that the discriminatory classification was necessary in the service of some compelling State interest. Kohn v. Davis, 320 F. Supp. 246 (D. Vt. 1970), aff'd, 405 U.S. 1034, 92 S. Ct. 1305, 31 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Constitution of the United States proscribes a treatment differential promoted by the state in limiting the rights of a bona fide resident simply because he is a recent arrival. Kohn v. Davis, 320 F. Supp. 246 (D. Vt. 1970), aff'd, 405 U.S. 1034, 92 S. Ct. 1305, 31 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont one year residency requirement to vote in elections penalized recent arrivals from other states who had not fulfilled the requirement even though they had become bona fide residents, thereby hampering their fundamental right to travel interstate, and State officials named defendants in challenge to requirement had burden of proving that the restriction was justified as being necessary in the service of some compelling State interest. Kohn v. Davis, 320 F. Supp. 246 (D. Vt. 1970), aff'd, 405 U.S. 1034, 92 S. Ct. 1305, 31 L. Ed. 2d 576 (1972).

        Subsec. (a) of this section requires only an intent to reside in a town indefinitely, not permanently. Shivelhood v. Davis, 336 F. Supp. 1111 (D. Vt. 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining "intention of remaining there indefinitely" under subsec. (a) of this section, it is the actual and good faith intent which is to be determined, from all surrounding circumstances, not the apparent probability or likelihood of a change in that intent in the near or distant future. 1971 Op. Atty. Gen. No. 781-F.
       </p>
       <p>
        Those charged with determining matter of intent should do so with an open mind and exclusively on the basis of the evidence before them, and if that evidence, including the credibility of claimant and other witnesses, would persuade a reasonable man, or fail to satisfy him, they should make their determination accordingly. 1971 Op. Atty. Gen. No. 781-F.
       </p>
       <p>
        Legal domicile is a mixed question of law and fact, primarily of fact, to be determined in the last analysis by the intent of the claimant as evidenced by all visible evidence tending to show intent, and not necessarily only by what claimant says his intent is. 1971 Op. Atty. Gen. No. 781-F.
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining legal domicile, intent to return to a town from which one is absent but in which one is domiciled cannot necessarily be measured by any specific period of time; a long absence may be evidence of an intent to abandon one domicile or adopt another, but is not necessarily conclusive and is only one factor to be considered and weighed in the light of all other available evidence. 1971 Op.

        The board of civil authority is required to place on the check list any member of the class who files a statement under subsec. (b) of this section unless the board has sufficient evidence which would serve to rebut such a statement. Shivelhood v. Davis, 336 F. Supp. 1111 (D. Vt. 1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        A statement filed in accord with subsec. (b) of this section is sufficient to establish the claim if it is not rebutted or contradicted. 1971 Op. Atty. Gen. No. 781-F.
       </p>
       <p>
        Once the statement required by subsec.

        The statement required by subsec.

        The fact that a student lives in a dormitory, is unmarried, is supported financially by his parents, who live elsewhere, would be considered a minor in the state in which his parents live and occasionally visits his parents, is not alone sufficient to preclude domicile for voting purposes in the town in which the student attends school, although such factors may be considered together with other evidence.

        The term "residence" as used in this and other provisions relating to the qualifications of voters is synonymous with home and domicile, denoting a permanent dwelling place to which the party when absent intends to return. 1936 Op. Atty. Gen. 502.

        A summer resident who desires to change his residence to a town in this State and buys property and makes for himself a home would, after a year, be entitled to vote, and his mere physical absence from the town or State, being regarded by him as temporary, is not such an act as would disqualify him from voting. 1940 Op.

        The provision of this section relating to college students means no more than that they may not gain, or lose, a residence for voting purposes simply because they are attending a college. 1971 Op. Atty. Gen. No. 781-F.
       </p>
       <p>
        For voting purposes, the residence of an otherwise eligible college student is the town in which he is legally domiciled as his permanent dwelling place with the intention of remaining there indefinitely or returning there is absent from it. 1971 Op. Atty. Gen. No. 781-F.
       </p>
       <p>
        If an otherwise qualified college student can establish his legal domicile as being in the town where he is attending college, he is entitled to have his name placed on the check list and to vote in that town. 1971 Op. Atty. Gen. No. 781-F.
       </p>
       <p>
        Some of the factors that may, in a given case, be evidence of a college student's intent to adopt a town as his legal domicile, all of which may be absent and such intent still be found in some instances, are: Ownership of and payment of property taxes on property; permanent and/or temporary mailing address; where poll taxes are paid; place of residence in the town (facilities provided by the college or rented or owned property for example); where and with whom he lives during vacations; if previous legal domicile where and with whom he lives during vacations; if previous legal domicile is in another state that considers or would consider him a minor, whether he is legally emancipated there from control by his parents or guardian; place and nature of any gainful employment and whether college is employer and for purpose of defraying college expenses; whether he has a Vermont driver's license or would need one to drive in Vermont; place where any owned motor vehicles are registered and address on registration; whether he hold any other license required by Vermont or one of its municipalities; extent of involvement in official, political, social, and other affairs of town claimed as domicile, apart from those of an institution he attends as a student; whether he has personal income to maintain himself in the town independently of his parents; evidence of interests or reasons which would motivate him to remain in or return to the town as a permanent resident, other than attendance at a college there. 1971 Op. Atty. Gen. No. 781-F.

        It had been common practice for defeated candidates from major parties to file certificates of nomination after the primary election so that their names could be on the ballot for the general election; however, the intent of the Legislature in enacting this chapter was to give minor political parties the right to present candidates for a general election, and this chapter expresses the procedure for them to follow. 1964-66 Op.

       <p>
        The words "voters representing a political party which polled at least one percent of the entire vote cast for Governor in the state at the preceding general election" does not require all qualifying parties to have had a candidate for Governor; the total vote for Governor was merely selected as the measuring index, the governorship being the principal State office. Abbott v. Thomas, 130 Vt. 71, 286 A.2d 272 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        A party's qualification under this section and
        §
        571 of this title is to be determined by the size of the vote for the leading vote-getter on the ballot under that party's label. Abbott v. Thomas, 130 Vt. 71, 286 A.2d 272 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        A political party that had a candidate in the last general election who polled less than five percent and more than one percent of the votes cast statewide for Governor could properly nominate its candidates under this section's provisions, and was entitled to have its candidate placed on the ballot for a special election of U.S. Senator and Representative.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The cardinal rule for the guidance of election officers and courts in determining the validity of ballots is that if the intent of the voter can be determined with reasonable certainty from inspection of the ballot, effect must be given to that intent and the vote counted in accordance therewith, provided the voter has substantially complied with the requisites of election law; if the intent cannot be fairly and satisfactorily ascertained, the ballot cannot rightfully be counted.

         *2. Admissibility of parol evidence.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The intention of the voter who cast a disputed ballot is controlling in determining for what person or office it should be counted, but that intention must be deduced from the ballot itself, read in light of the surrounding circumstances of public character, which may be shown by parol; such extrinsic evidence cannot be received to contradict the ballot, nor when it is so defective as to express no intention whatever.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Where a voter affixes to his ballot a sticker containing the name of a candidate and an X after the name, both printed thereon, he thereby places a cross opposite the name and such ballot is to be counted. In re Manchester Town Election, 115 Vt. 230, 55 A.2d 612 (1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, inspectors of an election were warranted in counting a ballot marked with double or irregular markings instead of with the required cross (X) where it was possible to determine the intent of the voter and the record did not show that the inspectors of election were satisfied and decided the markings were made for the purpose of enabling the ballot to be identified and the vote traced. Morgan v. Deverannes, 86 Vt. 137, 83 A. 660 (1912).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, among ballots cast at annual town meeting for rival candidates for office of lister, there were thirteen upon which was printed in small type, "For Road Commissioner," under which, in large black letters, was the name of one of the candidates, the thirteen ballots were so defective that they could not be aided by extrinsic evidence and were void.

        The provisions of this section do not refer challenged elections to the county courts but rather make a Superior judge a special officer to supervise recounts in the case of county officers, and in that special capacity, the duties of the Superior judge are specifically mandated, the most important one being to certify the result of the recount.

       <p>
        As recounts seldom reach results without discrepancy, the proper function of the Superior judge in recounts for county officials is to report, by way of certification, the results of the recount however great its variation from the original tally.

     <p>
      The order of the U.S. District Court for the district of Vermont entered August 3, 1964, modified and affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States, January 12, 1965 (
      Parsons v. Buckley,
      85 S. Ct. 503, 379 U.S. 359, 13 L. Ed. 2d 352) requires that both houses of the General Assembly of Vermont be apportioned and districted on a basis other than the manner provided for in the Constitution of this State. Such order further provides that if reapportionment legislation is not enacted by July 1, 1965, the district court shall reapportion the General Assembly so as to comply with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution.
    In the light of this order, the General Assembly of Vermont declares that apportioning and districting is primarily a responsibility of the Legislature at this time to be accomplished by this chapter, and in such a manner as to achieve substantial equality in the choice of members of the General Assembly as guaranteed by the Constitution of the United States of America.
    It is further declared to be the policy of the State of Vermont that the constitutional basis of apportionment of the House of Representatives can best be measured in this State by population.

        In action by two towns challenging reapportionment, evidence of common social, economic, and political ties between the towns and the other towns in their new district, together with the other criteria - numerical equality, geographic contiguity and compactness, and political boundaries - provide a rational and legitimate basis for the Legislature's decision.

       <p>
        In reviewing specific violations claimed by petitioners challenging the reapportionment of voting districts, the redistricting plan must be considered as a whole, taking into account the statewide implications.

       </p>
       <p>
        If a redistricting plan is consistent with the fundamental constitutional requirement that districts be drawn to afford equality of representation, the Supreme Court will return it to the Legislature only when there is no rational or legitimate basis for any deviations from other constitutional or statutory criteria.

        To make a prima facie case, petitioners challenging the reapportionment of voting districts must show that the State has failed to meet constitutional or statutory standards or policies with regard to a specific part of the plan; only then does the burden shift to the State, to show that satisfying those requirements was impossible because of the impermissible effect it would have had on other districts.

      On or before July 1 of the year following each decennial census under the authority of Congress, the Board shall prepare a tentative proposal for the reapportionment of the House of Representatives. Whenever, in the tentative proposal, it appears that one town or city should be divided into two or more initial districts, or that part of one town or city should be combined with part or all of another town or city to form an initial district, the Board shall immediately notify the board of civil authority of each town and city thus affected. The boards of civil authority may, on or before August 1, recommend to the Legislative Apportionment Board the manner in which initial district lines within those towns and cities should be drawn, always having regard for the standards of apportionment set forth in section 1903 of this title. Upon request of any board of civil authority, the Legislative Apportionment Board shall designate one of its members, or a person designated in section 1908 of this title, to call and preside without vote over a joint meeting of two or more boards of civil authority for the purpose of making joint recommendations.

       Within 30 days of the effective date of any apportionment bill enacted pursuant to section 1906b, 1906c, or 1907 of this chapter, any five or more voters of the State aggrieved by the plan or act may petition the Supreme Court of Vermont for review of same.
      </li>
      <li id="t17c34As1909ol1b">
       The sole grounds of review to be considered by the Supreme Court shall be that the apportionment plan, or any part of it, is unconstitutional or violates section 1903 of this chapter.

       The Supreme Court may designate one or more Justices, one or more Superior judges, or one or more masters, to take testimony and make findings of fact in any appeal or consolidated appeals under this section.

       In the event the Supreme Court allows any appeal upon one or both grounds set forth in subsection (b) of this section, it shall forward its opinion and decision to the General Assembly, which shall forthwith revise and correct the apportionment law in light of the Supreme Court's decision, to conform to the requirements of law. The Supreme Court shall retain jurisdiction until the General Assembly has produced a plan conforming to all constitutional and statutory requirements, which plan shall thereupon become law.

        Supreme Court review of act reapportioning State Senate was limited to testing it by the appropriate constitutional and statutory standards, even in the presence of alternatives that give the appearance of better representation. In re Senate Bills 177 & 83, 132 Vt. 282, 318 A.2d 157 (1974).

        Vermont filing deadline for candidates applies equally to all candidates and does not place independents at a particular disadvantage for accessing the ballot; rather, the registration deadline is a reasonable, nondiscriminatory regulation that imposes at most a minor burden on plaintiffs' rights. Furthermore, the State-claimed desire to prevent sore-loser candidacy is legitimate and sufficiently justifies any mild burden imposed. Trudell v. State, 193 Vt. 515, 71 A.3d 1235 (2013).

       <p>
        Secretary of State's interpretation of statute to require that town clerks certify only names appearing on original nominating petitions unduly burdened the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of an independent candidate and his supporters. The burden on their rights was minor, but not trivial, and the requirement did not serve the State's interests of deterring fraud and promoting orderly elections in that the fraud scenario offered by the State was contrived and the administrative burdens were not so substantial or insurmountable as to outweigh the burden on the protected rights. Anderson v. State, 194 Vt. 437, 82 A.3d 577 (2013).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Certification requirement for a statement of nomination merely calls upon town clerks to certify that the persons whose names appear as signers of the statement are registered voters in the town. Nothing about the certification requirement calls upon town clerks to authenticate the signatures on the nominating petitions. Anderson v. State, 194 Vt. 437, 82 A.3d 577 (2013).

    The master checklist shall be divided in a way that ensures that all voters on a particular checklist will be voting on the same questions and candidates and will be given identical ballots.

The town clerk shall notify the public of the mobile polling station three days prior to operation by posting at the town clerk's office and at the mobile polling station site the date and hours that the mobile polling station will operate. The Secretary of State shall establish procedures that ensure that:

       prior to distributing a ballot, the election officials shall verify that the voter's name is on the town checklist or will register the individual to vote if he or she is not registered and is qualified to vote in the town. The election officials shall make a list of the names of each voter who has voted at the mobile polling site;
      </li>
      <li id="t17c51sub06s2532aol12">

       upon the closure of the mobile polling place, the election officials shall immediately return the ballot envelopes, list of names, and any unvoted ballots to the town clerk who shall add each voter's name to the list of early or absentee voters and commingle the envelopes with other returned early absentee ballot envelopes in the vault. Ballots that are returned along with a new voter registration form shall be kept in a secure place in the vault until the registration process has been completed and then processed as in this subdivision.

       The text of subsec. (b) is based on a harmonization of two amendments. During the 2013 Adjourned Session, this subsection was amended twice, by Act Nos. 96 and 161, resulting in two versions of this subsection. In order to reflect all of the changes enacted by the Legislature during the 2013 Adjourned Session, the text of Act Nos. 96 and 161 were merged to arrive at a single version of the subsection.

        Elections statute permits - but does not require - the destruction of ballots and tally sheets after the expiration of the preservation period; thus, in the absence of a clear statutory provision or purpose requiring that these election materials remain under seal if not destroyed, the Vermont Supreme Court is constrained to construe the provision narrowly to permit the disclosure promoted by the Vermont Access to Public Records Act. There is no contrary intent in the few specific statutes authorizing the unsealing of ballots in certain limited circumstances, such as where a container is damaged, or in the provisions for disclosure of other election materials, such as "spoiled" ballots.

       </h5>
       <p>
        While the custodian may have a good faith belief that the records may be destroyed in reliance upon the elections statute, nevertheless this is precisely the sort of legal conclusion that the review process under the Vermont Access to Public Records Act was established to determine. Accordingly, the discretionary authority to destroy ballots and tally sheets after the preservation period has expired must be stayed when a public-records request for the material is filed, and the stay must remain in effect until the request is resolved. Price v. Town of Fairlee, 190 Vt. 66, 26 A.3d 26 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Elections statute permits - but does not require - the destruction of ballots and tally sheets after the expiration of the preservation period; thus, in the absence of a clear statutory provision or purpose requiring that these election materials remain under seal if not destroyed, the Vermont Supreme Court is constrained to construe the provision narrowly to permit the disclosure promoted by the Vermont Access to Public Records Act. There is no contrary intent in the few specific statutes authorizing the unsealing of ballots in certain limited circumstances, such as where a container is damaged, or in the provisions for disclosure of other election materials, such as "spoiled" ballots. Price v. Town of Fairlee, 190 Vt. 66, 26 A.3d 26 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        No legislative policy evident from the election statutes, whether considered singly or as a whole, was furthered by maintaining the confidentiality of ballots and tally sheets from a 2006 election. The preservation period for the election in question had expired, the election results were final, and the purpose of maintaining the ballots under seal had been served. Price v. Town of Fairlee, 190 Vt. 66, 26 A.3d 26 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under circumstances where a request under the Vermont Access to Public Records Act (PRA) is pending, the destruction of ballots must be treated as unauthorized. The PRA establishes a clear and orderly process for the handling of PRA requests, which would be circumvented, and the citizen's right to access defeated, if the statute giving discretionary authority to destroy ballots and tally sheets after the preservation period has expired were applied to allow the custodian to unilaterally destroy the requested ballots and tally sheets even when an access request remains pending. Price v. Town of Fairlee, 190 Vt. 66, 26 A.3d 26 (2011).

       <p>
        This section and section 2617 of this title, purporting to confer general jurisdiction on the Superior Court to hear and determine matters relating to elections, insofar as they relate to elections to the House of Representatives, are an improper delegation of legislative powers to a separate branch of government, the Judicial Branch, contrary to the separation of powers doctrine set forth in Chapter II, section 5 of the Vermont Constitution. Kennedy v. Chittenden, 142 Vt. 397, 457 A.2d 626 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since whatever result reached in a judicial adjudication contemplated under this section is subject to total revision or reversal by the exercise by the General Assembly of its acknowledged power over its own members as provided in Chapter II, section 14 of the Vermont Constitution, such power of revision, whether exercised or not, represents an intrusion prohibited by the doctrine of separation of powers and runs contrary to the precept that the exercise of judicial authority must lead to a final enforceable result and not be merely informative or advisory. Kennedy v. Chittenden, 142 Vt. 397, 457 A.2d 626 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        An election contest initiated in Superior Court had no support in law, and the Superior Court was without jurisdiction to hear and determine the cause as stated in the complaint, inasmuch as this section and section 2617 of this title, purporting to confer general jurisdiction in election matters on the Superior Court, insofar as they related to elections to the House of Representatives, were violative of the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers since they improperly delegated legislative powers to the Judicial Branch in providing for a judicial determination as to the qualifications of electors and since the judicial adjudication contemplated under these sections was subject to revision or reversal by the General Assembly.

        Where article proposed for inclusion in warning was to see if voters of school district would direct that the annual meeting be held not later than January 20 beginning in 1970, and course of litigation was such that supreme court's decision would come at a time when a vote on the question could very likely be taken only after January 20 or so near that date that the annual meeting could not be properly warned and held, mandamus would not be granted to compel school board to warn requested meeting of school district. Whiteman v. Brown, 128 Vt. 384, 264 A.2d 793 (1970). (Decided under prior law.)

       <p>
        Where petition of certain voters was filed with clerk of town school district requesting that special meeting be warned for purpose of reconsidering previous vote authorizing purchase of certain land on which new school building was to be erected, selectboard for school district had no option as to whether or not they would warn the meeting requested, but were compelled by statute to give such warning.

       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that petition by voters for meeting for reconsideration of previous vote authorizing purchase of land for site of new school building was filed with clerk of school district was of no consequence, since such was technical, if not substantial, compliance with statute, the matter presented being one within purview of selectboard for school district.

        School district budget could be established by Australian ballot only as proposed by its school board upon affirmative vote at the annual or subsequent meeting; therefore, petition signed by approximately ten percent of district's voters requesting that an article be included in the warning proposing a lower budget than that proposed by the board was for an unlawful purpose and correctly excluded from the warning.

        Subsec. (a) of this section provides municipalities with discretion over whether to present an article to voters - even a nonbinding article included under 17 V.S.A.
        §
        2103(27) - when it does not at all relate to municipal business or any matter falling within municipal authority. Clift v. City of South Burlington, 181 Vt. 571, 917 A.2d 483 (mem.) (January 18, 2007).

        Where two statutes may apply to a single circumstance, with conflicting consequences, the general statute must yield to the special; hence, an attempt by a town under the provisions of this section to reconsider its favorable vote on joining a union high school district was, under the provisions of 16 V.S.A.
        §
        662(a) and (d), null and void where the vote to withdraw from the district was taken less than a year after the district had become a body politic and corporate. Appelget & Elliott v. Baird, 126 Vt. 503, 236 A.2d 671 (1967). (Decided under prior law.)

        The warning of a municipal meeting shall set forth the business to be done and the subjects to be considered with such reasonable certainty as will notify all interested in the subject matter of the proposed vote or action and the time and place of the meeting. Brochu v. Brown, 128 Vt. 549, 268 A.2d 745 (1970). (Decided under prior law.)

       <p>
        To comply with requirement that warning of town meeting shall set forth "the business to be done and subjects to be considered," all that is necessary is that they shall be stated with such reasonable certainty as will indicate to all interested subject matter of proposed action by town. Walsh v. Farrington, 105 Vt. 269, 165 A. 914 (1933). (Decided under prior law.)

       </h5>
       <p>
        Under a warning to see if district will "vote to raise money to pay the district expenses," a vote to "raise money to support the school and pay the indebtedness of the district" was sufficiently definite. Adams v. Sleeper, 64 Vt. 544, 24 A. 990 (1892). (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Warning to see if town will vote tax for purpose of paying bounty did not authorize vote to borrow money for this purpose. Atwood v. Lincoln, 44 Vt. 332 (1872). (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Where warning was "to consider the propriety of paying bounties to such persons as may enlist" to fill an existing quota, and vote was "to pay to each volunteer to fill the required quota," vote had reference to those who should thereafter enlist. Sargent v. Ludlow, 42 Vt. 726 (1870). (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Where warning contained following articles: "To see whether the town will vote bounties to supply the quota of the said town under the recent call of the President of the United States for 300,000 men to serve in the war. In case the town shall vote to pay such bounties, to raise and provide means for the same," and vote was: "that the selectmen be instructed to borrow a sum not exceeding $3000, for the purpose of paying $300 each to volunteers that may hereafter enlist for the war, under the recent call of the President of the United States, including the one that is understood has enlisted, payment to be made such enlisted men when mustered in to the service of the United States," there was no such difference between warning and vote as to render latter inoperative. Mudget v. Johnson, 42 Vt. 423 (1869). (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Warning of town meeting to see if town would vote to divide school district and to make such other alterations in school districts in town as might be found necessary, was sufficiently definite to warrant vote of town to form a new district out of portion of territory of school district which was specified in vote. Weeks v. Batchelder, 41 Vt. 317 (1868). (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Words "to ascertain whether the town would vote a tax on the grand list for the purpose of paying bounties to soldiers, and paying its indebtedness," in warning for town meeting, were sufficient on general demurrer to justify town in raising money to pay bounties to soldiers, and indebtedness of the town. Alger v. Curry, 40 Vt. 437 (1868), same case 38 Vt. 382. (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Vote of town meeting instructing selectboard to procure recruits for town and empowering selectboard to borrow funds on five years credit for town to pay bounties to such recruits, was not warranted by a warning to see if town would raise a tax upon grand list to pay recruits, and how much and when, and to instruct selectboard in disposal of funds so raised. Blush v. Colchester, 39 Vt. 193 (1867). (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Where warning was, "to see if the town will raise money to pay the bounty promised to soldiers," and under that article town "voted to raise fifty-five cents on the dollar of the grand list, to pay the bounty offered to soldiers," vote was sufficiently particular and definite and object specified was within powers of the town. Blodgett v. Holbrook, 39 Vt. 336 (1866). (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Article in warning of town meeting as follows: "To see if the town will make alterations in school districts when met," was sufficient to warrant consideration by town in town meeting of any proposed changes in limits of existing school districts. Ovitt v. Chase, 37 Vt. 196 (1864). (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Where article in warning for town meeting was to see if town would divide school district, and annex portion of it to one district and remainder to another, town could at such meeting legally set whole of district proposed to be divided to either of the other districts named in warning.

       <p>
        Article to see if the voters of school district would direct school board to have an audit of all financial and related records of the district for the three preceding school years made by an accounting firm was inappropriate for inclusion in warning for special meeting as it did not deal with proper and appropriate business, therefore, Supreme Court could not issue mandamus to require school board to include the article in the warning. Whiteman v. Brown, 128 Vt. 384, 264 A.2d 793 (1970). (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Mandamus would not be issued to compel school board to warn requested special meeting of school district where one of the two proposed articles to be warned concerned business which it was not proper for the meeting to transact and the other concerned a moot issue, thus leaving petition for meeting without any proposal of business to be transacted.

       <p>
        In action by legal voters of town school district to restrain reconsideration of vote authorizing school board to purchase land for purpose of constructing new school building thereon, finding that the vote "had never been previously submitted to the legal voters" was not inconsistent with finding that petition was filed which requested that another special school district meeting be held for purpose of reconsidering the vote. Baird v. Town of Berlin, 126 Vt. 348, 231 A.2d 110 (1967). (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Questions voted at previous town school district meetings relating to the purchase on "site no. 2," purchase of land "under option," authorization of bond issue to buy Pike site and construct new school building thereon, and the purchase of Pike site for larger sum than that voted at June 6, 1966, meeting were substantively different than question voted on at June 6 meeting authorizing school board to purchase Pike land for purpose of constructing new school building thereon, thus permitting reconsideration of the June 6 vote under this section.

        Where petition of certain voters was filed with clerk of town school district requesting that special meeting be warned for purpose of reconsidering previous vote authorizing purchase of certain land on which new school building was to be erected, selectboard for school district had no option as to whether or not they would warn the meeting requested, but were compelled by 16 V.S.A.
        §
        362 to give such warning. Baird v. Town of Berlin, 126 Vt. 348, 231 A.2d 110 (1967). (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that petition by voters for meeting for reconsideration of previous vote authorizing purchase of land for site of new school building was filed with clerk of school district was of no consequence, since such was technical, if not substantial, compliance with this section, the matter presented being one within purview of selectboard for school district.

        Statutory duty of the school board to warn items concerning the "business to be transacted" means that petitioned items of business must be within the authority of voters to decide at town meeting. In the context of a school district, the petitioned items of business must be within the authority of voters to decide at a district meeting. Skiff v. S. Burlington Sch.

        Because the duty of the school board to warn of items concerning the "business to be transacted" meant that petitioned items of business had to be within the authority of voters to decide, and the name of the school district's sports teams was not a matter within voters' authority to decide at a district-wide meeting, the district was not required by statute to put the issue to a district-wide vote, although it could have elected to do so if it wished.

        Because the charter of the Town of Brattleboro creates a separate and specific avenue for filling a single vacancy on the town selectboard without leaving room for the special meeting petition, this section does not apply. Town of Brattleboro v. Garfield, 180 Vt. 90, 904 A.2d 1157 (June 16, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where more than five percent of town's registered voters signed a petition demanding a special town meeting on an agreement entered into by the selectboard, the selectboard did not have a duty to call the meeting, since if the selectboard had the power to make the agreement, it was legally binding and the voters could not undo it, and if the selectboard did not have the power to make the agreement, it was invalid irrespective of the call for a meeting. Kirchner v. Giebink, 150 Vt. 172, 552 A.2d 372 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where voters at annual town meeting voted to increase size of selectboard from three to five without also electing the individuals to fill the two vacancies, and thereafter at least five percent of the legal voters of the town signed petition requesting special town meeting to elect two additional selectboard members failure of defendant selectboard members to promptly warn for, and hold, requested town meeting was violation of their statutory duty to do so. Welton v. Town of Brandon, 132 Vt. 74, 313 A.2d 676 (1973). (Decided under prior law.)

        Where result of proposed special town meeting to vote on the appropriateness of the Rutland Housing Authority's selection of a single site for the development of low-income housing under federal project would only be advisory and not binding on the authority, mandamus would not issue to compel the mayor to call the meeting, as the effect of the issuance would be nugatory and serve no lawful purpose.

        Alteration or amendment of town grand tax list properly signed and filed by the listers, and substitution of a body other than the listers to set up a basis for property valuation for tax purposes, was beyond power of town meeting and no clear right was violated when selectboard refused to warn special town meeting sought by taxpayers, so that taxpayers were not entitled to mandamus to compel selectboard to warn meeting.

        Town agent to prosecute and defend suits has no authority to settle a suit brought to recover damages for injuries occasioned by insufficiencies of highways, and make promise to pay damages that would be binding on town. Clay v. Wright, 44 Vt. 538 (1872). (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>
       <p>
        In administration of that portion of criminal justice entrusted to towns, in which fine and costs collected go to town, and which is conducted at expense of town, necessity for legal advice and assistance in many cases is obvious and authority to employ counsel in such cases is lodged in town grand juror and not in town agent. Burton v. Inhabitants of Norwich, 34 Vt. 345 (1861). (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>
       <p>
        When town agent employs an attorney in suit in favor of or against town, town is legally holden to pay for attorney's services without express vote to that effect; and rule is same, if town agent, being himself an attorney, renders professional services for town. Langdon v. Castleton, 30 Vt. 285 (1858). (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>
       <p>
        If town agent, who is also an attorney, continues, after his term of office has expired, in the management of suits in which town is interested, without any objection from, or any express employment by town or his successor, he is entitled to recover of town for professional services rendered after his term of office as town agent has expired.

        Towns are required by statute to elect annually three, four, or five listers who constitute a board, a majority of which is essential to legal action; and hence, an indictment, charging lister with perjury in that he violated his official oath, was defective without allegation of election of requisite number of listers, and that they qualified and acted as such.

        §
        711e, which sets forth the procedure when a school district elects to have its budget determined by Australian ballot, because there had already been a reconsideration vote of the school budget at issue; the term "question voted on" in subsection (c) of this section means the budget of the school district and not the specific budget amount submitted to the voters and thus this section prevented further revotes without the approval of the legislative body of the district.

        Statute regarding reconsideration of votes at town meetings was designed to enable the voters of a town, upon securing the necessary signatures, to secure a vote to reconsider a matter previously acted upon by the voters. The goals of the statute would be frustrated by an interpretation that suggested that the right of voters to petition for reconsideration of a question turns on the parliamentary procedure by which the question was defeated in the first instance.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When any of the requirements as to notice or warning of an annual or special municipal meeting have been omitted or not complied with, the omission or noncompliance, if the meeting and the business transacted at it is otherwise legal and within the scope of the municipal powers, may be corrected and legalized by vote at a regular meeting or special meeting of the municipality called and duly warned for that purpose.
    The question to be voted upon shall substantially be, "Shall the action taken at the meeting of this town (or city, village or district) held on (state date) in spite of the fact that (state the error or omission), and any act or action of the municipal officers or agents pursuant thereto be readopted, ratified, and confirmed." Errors or omissions in the conduct of an original meeting that are not the result of an unlawful notice or warning or noncompliance within the scope of the warning may be cured by a resolution of the legislative body of the municipality by a vote of two-thirds of all its members at a regular meeting or a special meeting called for that purpose, stating that the defect was the result of oversight, inadvertence, or mistake.
    When an error or omission of this nature has been thus corrected by resolution, all business within the terms of the action of the qualified voters shall be as valid as if the requirements had been initially complied with, condition, however, that the original action thereby corrected by the legislative body was in compliance with the legal exercise of its corporate powers.

      At its annual meeting, a town shall vote such sums of money as it deems necessary for the interest of its inhabitants and for the prosecution and defense of the common rights. It shall express in its vote the specific amounts, or the rate on a dollar of the grand list, to be appropriated for laying out and repairing highways and for other necessary town expenses. If a town votes specific amounts in lieu of a rate on a dollar of the grand list, the selectboard shall, after the grand list book has been computed and lodged in the office of the town clerk, set the tax rate necessary to raise the specific amounts voted. The selectboard may apply for grants and may accept and expend grants or gifts above those that are approved in the town budget. The selectboard shall include, in its annual report, a description of all grants or gifts accepted during the year and associated expenditures.

        The Australian ballot is one on which the names of all candidates, or all issues, are printed, is distributed at the polling places only, and is marked in secret; though almost any written or printed ballot will suffice as long as the voter's privacy is assured. 1970-72 Op.

        In this section's provision that the ballot shall not be used in municipal meetings where the population is under eight thousand unless the municipality, at its annual meeting or at a special meeting called for that purpose, votes to have it applied, and then only to the election of officers, except when such municipality shall vote to make it apply to other specified business, the phrase "called for that purpose" qualifies both "the election of officers" and "other specified business"; therefore, the meeting must be warned on the question of the ballot both when officers are to be elected and also for any other specific business. 1970-72 Op.

        Plaintiff's claims that his rights were violated when defendant town refused to warn a decomposed, i.e., line-item, budget for approval by Australian ballot for the town meeting, as was mandated by a majority vote of town residents at an earlier special meeting, were without legal basis, and the town was justified in refusing to conduct the vote in that manner as the Legislature has given town selectboards the authority to conduct the annual budget vote by Australian ballot only if town voters approve an article in substantial compliance with the language of 17 V.S.A.
        §
        2680(c), which allows for a vote on a complete budget. Mooney v. Town of Stowe, 183 Vt. 600, 950 A.2d 1198 (mem.) (2008).

        Vermont Supreme Court interprets "for the purpose of .
    . . influencing an election" in the statute defining a political action committee (PAC) to mean "for the objective purpose of persuading someone to vote in a certain manner in an election." So construed, the definition of a PAC (and the similarly construed definition of "expenditure") is not vague under the Fourteenth Amendment. State v. Green Mt. Future, 194 Vt. 625, 86 A.3d 981 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        The definitions of "political committee," "contribution," and "expenditure" in 17 V.S.A.
        §
        2801 are not unconstitutionally vague under the Due Process Clause. The language "for the purpose of . . . influencing an election" is interpreted to mean the same as simply "supporting or opposing one or more candidates." Under this limiting construction, there is no vagueness in these definitions. Moreover, "supporting or opposing one or more candidates" is not unconstitutionally vague. Vt. Right to Life Comm., Inc. v. Sorrell, 875 F. Supp. 2d 376 (D. Vt. 2012), aff'd, 758 F.3d 118 (2d Cir. 2014), cert. denied, - U.S.

"Political committee" status does not impose onerous burdens on entities meeting the definition, and the disclosure obligations of political committees must be analyzed under an exacting scrutiny test.

       <p>
        Vermont Code defines a political committee as a group that makes certain expenditures for one of three alternative reasons: for the purpose of supporting or opposing one or more candidates, influencing an election, or advocating a position on a public question. With respect to elections of public officers, as opposed to "public question" elections, the Vermont Supreme Court reads the statute as containing two alternative elements: "for the purpose of supporting or opposing one or more candidates" and "for the purpose of . . . influencing an election." State v. Green Mt. Future, 194 Vt. 625, 86 A.3d 981 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Specifically defined phrases in the statute defining a political action committee ("supporting or opposing one or more candidates" and "advocating a position on a public question") are of a particular class: they both refer to advocacy for a vote in a particular way in an election. The Court therefore interprets the more general language "for the purpose of . . . influencing an election" to refer only to this class of advocacy; in other words, "influencing" means encouraging a vote for or against a candidate or a vote "yes" or "no" on a public question. State v. Green Mt. Future, 194 Vt. 625, 86 A.3d 981 (2013).

       <p>
        Limits on contributions to political committees must be closely drawn to achieve a sufficiently important government interest. This distinguishes them from limits on expenditures, which are subject to strict scrutiny. The state interest supporting such contribution limits are preventing the appearance or reality of
        quid pro quo
        corruption in the relationship between a contributor and a candidate and preventing the circumvention of valid contribution limits. In an as-applied challenge to these contribution limits, the facts are vital. The issue of independence from candidates is the touchstone of the contribution limit's constitutionality. Plaintiff claimed to make only independent expenditures. However, where the facts revealed that the structural melding between the plaintiff and a political committee that makes contributions to candidates left no significant functional divide between them, the $2,000 limit on contributions the plaintiff may accept from individual sources is constitutional. Vt. Right to Life Comm., Inc. v. Sorrell, 875 F. Supp. 2d 376 (D. Vt. 2012), aff'd, 758 F.3d 118 (2d Cir. 2014), cert. denied, - U.S.

       <p>
        Limits on contributions to candidates contained in 17 V.S.A.
        §
        2805 were unconstitutional because in their specific details (involving low maximum levels and other restrictions) they failed to satisfy the First Amendment's requirement of careful tailoring. That is to say, they imposed burdens upon First Amendment interests that (when viewed in light of the statute's legitimate objectives) were disproportionately severe. Randall v. Sorrell, 548 U.S. 230, 126 S. Ct. 2479, 165 L. Ed. 2d 482 (2006).

        According to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the out-of-state contribution limit, 17 V.S.A.
        §
        2805(c), is unconstitutional as it isolates one group of people (non-residents) and denied them the equivalent First Amendment rights enjoyed by others (Vermont residents). Landell v.

        Given that the limits on individual campaign contributions provided in No. 64 of the Acts of 1997 were later found to be unconstitutional and that Vermont has not enacted a law to replace the unconstitutional portions of Act 64, the weight of authority favors the application of the doctrine of revival, whereby the contribution limits provided in No. 197 of the Acts of 1981 (Adj. Sess.) would be revived to replace those contribution limits found to be unconstitutional. If the prior statute is not revived, campaign contribution limits would not exist. Oxfeld v. Sorrell, 2008 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 81872 (D. Vt. Oct. 15, 2008).

        In a plurality opinion, the U.S. Supreme Court concluded that the expenditure limits of 17 V.S.A.
        §
        2805a were unconstitutional as Vermont's primary justification for imposing its expenditure limits was not significantly different from Congress' rationale for the Buckley limits, preventing corruption and its appearance. The Court held that it was highly unlikely that fuller consideration of the time protection rationale, i.e., that expenditure limits are necessary in order to reduce the amount of time candidates must spend raising money, would have changed Buckley's result.

         1. Factors.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court correctly took four factors into account in assigning defendant a penalty for violating campaign finance laws: (1) the good or bad faith of the defendant; (2) the injury to the public; (3) the defendant's ability to pay; and (4) the necessity of vindicating the authority of the regulator. State v. Green Mt. Future, 194 Vt. 625, 86 A.3d 981 (2013).

         2. Decision.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        While there may be factors that would allow a court in its discretion not to assign a penalty for campaign finance violations, the court needs to state explicitly that it is doing so and include its rationale for this decision. State v. Green Mt. Future, 194 Vt. 625, 86 A.3d 981 (2013).

         3. Particular cases.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In deciding not to assess a penalty for defendant's violation of the disclosure requirement, the trial court did not err. It found that there was little or no harm caused; it considered deterrence and found that a $10,000 penalty for another violation was a sufficient deterrent; it applied the appropriate factors and determined that the $10,000 penalty was sufficient to meet the needs of the State to respond to defendant's failure to comply with the law; and it did not treat compliance with Internal Revenue Service requirements as a mitigating factor, but considered this in its evaluation of harm to the public and in its discussion of deterrence. State v. Green Mt. Future, 194 Vt. 625, 86 A.3d 981 (2013).

        Exacting scrutiny is the appropriate test for disclosure statutes; it requires a substantial relation between the disclosure requirement and a sufficiently important governmental interest. The requirement that political committees file disclosure reports is constitutional under the First Amendment. It bears a substantial relation to Vermont's sufficiently important interest in permitting Vermonters to learn of the sources of significant influence in their state's elections. Vt.

        The identification requirements for electioneering communications in 17 V.S.A.
        §
        2892 are not unconstitutionally overbroad under the First Amendment. There is no requirement that identification laws conform to federal statutes approved by the U.S. Supreme Court. The identification law promotes the substantial State interest in increasing the transparency of the sources of candidate support. The burden on speakers to comply with the law is minimal, and Vermont further limits the impact of the regulation by exempting small-scale electioneering items - lapel stickers and buttons - and individual electioneers who spend less than $150 in an election cycle. The requirements pass exacting scrutiny. Vt. Right to Life Comm., Inc. v. Sorrell, 875 F. Supp. 2d 376 (D. Vt. 2012), aff'd, 758 F.3d 118 (2d Cir. 2014), cert. denied, - U.S.

        Exacting scrutiny is the proper standard of review for disclosure statutes. The disclosure requirements for mass media activity expenditures under 17 V.S.A.
        §
        2893 are not unconstitutionally overbroad under the First Amendment. The twenty-four-hour reporting rule is properly tailored to the State's interest in allowing voters to determine the sources of campaign spending. In total, the law's burdens are minimal. Vt.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Vermont's public election financing system, including the contribution limit, expenditure limit, and the timing restrictions did not violate the First Amendment rights of candidates, their supporters, or political parties as, given the free choice to accept the grants and restrictions that public financing entails or to engage in unlimited private fundraising, candidates cannot complain that electing the former course burdens their rights. Corren v. Condos, 898 F.3d 209 (2d Cir. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Campaign financing definition of expenditures that included supporting or opposing a candidate and influencing an election was not unconstitutionally vague since the disclosure requirements for expenditures were not limited to speech that was the functional equivalent of express advocacy. Vt. Right to Life Comm., Inc. v. Sorrell, 758 F.3d 118 (2d Cir. 2014), cert. denied, Vt. Right to Life Comm., Inc. v. Sorrell, 2015 U.S. LEXIS 119 (U.S. Jan. 12, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Campaign financing definition of political committee that included supporting or opposing a candidate and influencing an election was not unconstitutionally vague, since the definition was sufficiently precise in not requiring identification of a specific candidate and extending beyond express advocacy. Vt. Right to Life Comm., Inc. v. Sorrell, 758 F.3d 118 (2d Cir. 2014), cert. denied, Vt. Right to Life Comm., Inc. v. Sorrell, 2015 U.S. LEXIS 119 (U.S. Jan. 12, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Campaign financing definition of "electioneering communications" was not unconstitutionally vague since the acts of promoting, supporting, attacking, or opposing a candidate clearly set forth confines within which potential speakers must act in order to avoid triggering the disclosure provisions. Vt. Right to Life Comm., Inc. v. Sorrell, 758 F.3d 118 (2d Cir. 2014), cert. denied, Vt. Right to Life Comm., Inc. v. Sorrell, 2015 U.S. LEXIS 119 (U.S. Jan. 12, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Disclosure and identification requirements for electioneering communications did not violate freedom of speech since application of requirements was not limited to express advocacy, and there was a substantial public interest in information related to elections. Vt. Right to Life Comm., Inc. v. Sorrell, 758 F.3d 118 (2d Cir. 2014), cert. denied, Vt. Right to Life Comm., Inc. v. Sorrell, 2015 U.S. LEXIS 119 (U.S. Jan. 12, 2015).
