        The duties of guardians ad litem (GALs) in contested custody cases bring them within the canon on disqualification of the Code of Judicial Conduct. Because the canon applies, an assistant judge should have disclosed her relationship and recused herself when she became aware that her sister was appointed GAL, or the court should have appointed a different GAL. Velardo v. Ovitt, 182 Vt. 180, 933 A.2d 227 (July 27, 2007).

        In a custody dispute where an assistant judge should have disclosed her relationship and recused herself when she became aware that her sister was appointed guardian ad litem, the family court's custody determination was required to be vacated and the case remanded for a new trial.

        A sheriff is justified, without a warrant, in pursuing and arresting one whom he has reasonable cause to suspect of the commission of a felony. In re Huard, 125 Vt. 189, 212 A.2d 640 (1965).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Where person granted writ of execution gives constable the writ and specific instructions concerning the levy and what to levy upon, person granted the writ has the burden of proving constable was not influenced by the instructions where he claims failure or refusal to levy, and absent such a showing the constable is fully exonerated unless dereliction in performance of duty imposed by the limiting instructions is shown. Dowlings, Inc. v. Mayo, 137 Vt. 548, 409 A.2d 588 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where law enforcement officer received writ of execution and letter stating writ should be served at named person's restaurant and if he refused to pay the writ should be satisfied from the receipts in the cash register of the restaurant, the officer had only a duty to levy pursuant to the letter and court trying action against officer for failure and refusal to satisfy the writ erroneously found that officer had duty to levy against such goods, chattels, and lands of debtor as he could find or levy upon the cash in the cash register. Dowlings, Inc. v. Mayo, 137 Vt. 548, 409 A.2d 588 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a judgment creditor informs the levying officer of existence and location of assets known to the creditor and gives the officer no further instructions, the officer must levy upon those assets or upon others; but where creditor gives officer specific instructions as to manner of levy and items to be seized, the officer must follow those directions when they are not in conflict with the law, and he is not bound to serve the writ in any other manner and ceases to be a public officer and becomes a private agent. Dowlings, Inc. v. Mayo, 137 Vt. 548, 409 A.2d 588 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff instructed defendant constable to levy against cash register receipts should person against whom execution was directed refuse to pay, plaintiff was not, in action claiming constable refused and failed to levy, entitled to mandamus commanding constable to levy against the goods, chattels, and lands of the person named in the execution, or against cash register receipts, as plaintiff had limited the duty of constable by limiting the levy instructions. Dowlings, Inc. v. Mayo, 137 Vt. 548, 409 A.2d 588 (1979).

        Mere operation of automobile owned and controlled by deputy sheriff incidental to travel in service of process does not constitute official act referred to in section and sheriff is not liable for damages resulting to persons or property occasioned by the negligent operation of such vehicle by his deputy. 1946 Op.

        Deputy sheriff who acts entirely outside mandate of writ or execution held by him is guilty of more than official misfeasance or neglect, and is not entitled to benefits of this section. Commercial Credit Corp. v. Dusckett, 114 Vt. 450, 49 A.2d 106 (1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to hold sheriff liable for acts of his deputy under this section, it must be shown that deputy failed to perform his duty as deputy while acting, or undertaking to act, in his official capacity. Hunt v. Hill, 101 Vt. 311, 143 A. 307 (1928).

        Distinction between liabilities of sheriff and that of his deputy to party injured is that, while each is liable for misfeasance, former, and not latter, is liable for nonfeasance of such deputy in duties of his office. Hutchinson v. Parkhurst, 1 Aik. 258 (1826).

        In action against sheriff for default of his deputy in not taking bail, and for making false return in suit where deputy returned that he had taken "good and sufficient bail," deputy, having been duly released by sheriff, was competent witness to prove that plaintiff directed him not to take bail, and such direction was bar to action. Ordway v. Bacon, 14 Vt. 378 (1842).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Even though deputy was convicted of neglect of duty for lewd and lascivious conduct while assigned to patrol duty, the sheriff could not be held liable to plaintiff for misconduct of the deputy under this section. Doe v. Forrest, 176 Vt. 476, 853 A.2d 48 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Seizure by officer of property under writ against another is official malfeasance, and if such seizure is made by deputy sheriff, sheriff is liable therefor. Lyman v. Holmes, 88 Vt. 431, 92 A. 829 (1914).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where deputy sheriff, in whose hands an original execution had been placed in season to charge property attached on the writ, attempted but negligently failed to procure an alias execution within life of original, whatever obligation deputy assumed by undertaking such service was personal and not official, and sheriff was not liable for such neglect. Cowdery v. Smith, 50 Vt. 243 (1877).
       </p>
       <p>
        When deputy sheriff sold goods on execution, on a credit of three months, by direction of plaintiff's attorney, sheriff was not responsible for his neglect to return the execution, as he did not act officially. Charles Kimball & Co. v. Perry, 15 Vt. 414 (1843).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sheriff is liable for official neglect of his deputy, but not for performance of any unofficial contract he may make. Wetherby v. Foster, 5 Vt. 136 (1832).
       </p>
       <p>
        Liabilities of sheriff for his deputy are those which law imposes, and are for neglect of duties which law requires to be done and he is not liable for breach of promises, which deputy makes. Tomlinson v. Wheeler, 1 Aik. 194 (1826).

        Ex-sheriff responsible for neglect of deputy after latter ceased to be his deputy and became the deputy of his successor in office. Stimpson v. Pierce, 42 Vt. 334 (1869).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is no defense that action for default was not commenced until after both sheriff and deputy had gone out of office. Coburn v. Chamberlin, 31 Vt. 326 (1858).

         3. Acts deemed those of sheriff.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Acts of deputy are to be regarded as acts of the sheriff, not in sense of either agency or identity, but rather in sense of official relation and of responsibility cast by law upon sheriff for acts of his deputy; not in sense that what deputy does is done by sheriff, but that, for what he does sheriff is made responsible as if he had officially done same thing. Flanagan v. Hoyt, 36 Vt. 565 (1864).
       </p>
       <p>
        Acts of deputy sheriff held to be acts of sheriff; and sheriff alone could sue or be sued for acts done in the execution of his office. Smith v. Joiner, 1 D. Chip. 62 (1797).

         4. Attachment of property.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where property was attached in favor of several creditors and judgments and execution were had by all but one which was pending, sheriff was responsible that any surplus remaining in hands of deputy be held by him under attachment in suit in which judgment had not yet been recovered, that deputy deliver it up on demand under execution on judgment in said suit, if one was obtained and, if not, that he restore it to the debtor. Stimpson v. Pierce, 42 Vt. 334 (1869).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sheriff was responsible for proceeds of property attached by his deputy, and by direction of parties sold on credit, where such proceeds came into hands of deputy before judgment recovered. Seaver v. Pierce, 42 Vt. 325 (1869); Stimpson v. Pierce, 42 Vt. 334 (1869).
       </p>
       <p>
        Deputy sheriff who attached property on writ cannot be charged with neglect in not keeping it and delivering it over on execution, unless execution was seasonably delivered to him, or demand made of him by officer having execution; and want of such demand is not excused where officer delivered property to debtor, who removed from county therewith. Jameson v. Macon, 12 Vt. 599 (1839).
       </p>
       <p>
        Attachment made by sheriff's deputy is the same as if made by him, and the lien is preserved by delivering execution to sheriff. Ayer v. Jameson, 9 Vt. 363 (1837).
       </p>
       <p>
        When property is attached by sheriff's deputy, delivery of execution to another deputy of same sheriff, and informing latter deputy of attachment, equally supports creditor's lien, act of each deputy being in a civil point of view acts of sheriff himself. Bliss v. Stevens, 4 Vt. 88 (1831).
       </p>
       <p>
        If deputy sheriff delivers personal property attached by him to person knowing situation of property and who undertakes merely to redeliver it on demand, sheriff may claim to have made the bailment himself and may maintain action in his own name against bailee to recover value of property so delivered to him. Davis v. Miller, 1 Vt. 9 (1826).

         5. Damages.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In action against sheriff for default of his deputy in levying an execution on real estate, measure of damages is actual value of real estate lost by void levy, and not amount agreed upon by appraisers as shown by officer's return. Parker v. Peabody, 56 Vt. 221 (1883).

         6. Defenses.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where county court rendered judgment for more than ad damnum in writ, such judgment, though erroneous, is not void; and error is not bar to action brought against sureties on the bond of deputy sheriff who failed to perform his duty in serving writ. Chaffee v. Hooper, 54 Vt. 513 (1881).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that execution issued for less sum than that for which judgment was rendered constituted no defense for sheriff who collected it, either by himself or his deputy, in an action for not paying creditor money so collected. Coburn v. Chamberlin, 31 Vt. 326 (1858).
       </p>
       <p>
        No action can be sustained by execution creditor against sheriff for default of his deputy in not paying to creditor avails of property sold upon execution, where property was sold upon credit by direction of creditor, or where such directions were given by those who were interested, as sureties, in having property sold, and were subsequently ratified by creditor. Bellows v. Administrator of Allen, 23 Vt. 169 (1851).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where creditor gave instructions to deputy sheriff and deputy was influenced thereby, sheriff was not liable for his conduct in regard to matter. Strongs v. Bradley, 14 Vt. 55 (1842).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where deputy sheriff had authority from creditor to manage an execution committed to his charge according to his discretion, sheriff was discharged of his liability for official neglect of such deputy. Fletchers v. Bradley, 12 Vt. 22 (1840).

       </h5>
       <p>
        In action against sheriff for default of deputy in not levying execution, it was competent for defendant to show by deputy what instructions deputy received from complaining party or his attorney as to serving execution, and what he did in obedience to such instructions. Cowdery v. Smith, 50 Vt. 235 (1877).
       </p>
       <p>
        In action against sheriff for default of deputy in not paying over to party entitled proceeds of sale of property attached by deputy, evidence that action in which attachment and sale was made was instituted by parties to it for purpose of enabling defendant therein to defraud his creditors, was not admissible, as sheriff was accountable for default in such case. Seaver v. Pierce, 42 Vt. 325 (1869).
       </p>
       <p>
        In action against sheriff for neglect of deputy in not executing and returning execution, evidence of existing agreement between creditor and deputy that he was to furnish deputy with business, and that deputy, among other things, was not to commit to jail any debtors in execution, unless by express order of creditor, was admissible. Downer v. Bowen, 12 Vt. 452 (1840).

        That State Constitution mentioned State's Attorneys when Constitution provided date for their election and the terms to be served did not make the powers and prerogatives of a State's Attorney constitutional functions that could not be taken away except by constitutional amendment, for the powers of State's Attorneys are set forth in the statutes, not the Constitution.

        Office of State's Attorney has broad discretion in deciding whether to initiate a criminal prosecution, and a decision not to prosecute is entitled to great deference; however, if the circumstances change and the State's Attorney or his successor is convinced that prosecution is warranted, a prosecution may be had.

        153, providing that the Attorney General has supervisory powers over criminal prosecutions and advisory powers with respect to State's Attorneys in matters, relating to that office, give the two offices at least equal authority to initiate criminal prosecutions. State's Attorney v. Attorney General, 138 Vt. 10, 409 A.2d 599 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a State's Attorney decides not to initiate a criminal prosecution, the sovereign power of the State to punish for crimes has not been set in motion in the first instance by an agency of the State authorized to do so, and an equal prosecutorial authority, such as the Attorney General in instant case, may initiate a criminal prosecution. State's Attorney v. Attorney General, 138 Vt. 10, 409 A.2d 599 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where Attorney General initiated prosecution for driving while intoxicated after State's Attorney had declined to do so, the State's Attorney had not preempted the field and the Attorney General did not supersede, displace, or interfere with the State's Attorney's decision, as Attorney General was validly exercising equal authority under law. State's Attorney v. Attorney General, 138 Vt. 10, 409 A.2d 599 (1979).

       <p>
        In action for taking tools commenced in name of State solely by direction of a State officer and prosecuted, not by State's Attorney, but by counsel employed by that officer, action was properly brought in name of State, and by proper authority, and defendant could not object that it was not prosecuted by State's Attorney.

        State's Attorneys have authority to bring persons accused of crimes before justices of the peace by information and cause them to be bound up for trial by county court; and recognizance, conditioned for appearance in county court of person bound over by justice of peace upon information of State's Attorney, is valid.

        Where deputy State's Attorney did not file her appointment and oath with county clerk as required by this section, she could not justify her acts as such in any suit to which she was a party, but she was a de facto officer, and not a party to proceeding for termination of parental rights in children, and petition she signed was sufficient to confer jurisdiction upon the court.

      Before the school directors, constable, road commissioner, collector of taxes, treasurer, assistant treasurer when appointed by the selectboard, clerk, and any other officer or employee of the town who has authority to receive or disburse town funds enter upon the duties of their offices, the selectboard shall require each to give a bond conditioned for the faithful performance of his or her duties: the school directors, to the town school district; the other named officers, to the town. The treasurer, assistant treasurer when appointed by the selectboard, and collector shall also be required to give a bond to the town school district for like purpose. All such bonds shall be in sufficient sums and with sufficient sureties as prescribed and approved by the selectboard. If the selectboard at any time considers a bond of any such officer or employee to be insufficient, it may require, by written order, the officer or employee to give an additional bond in such sum as it deems necessary. If an officer or employee, so required, neglects for ten days after such request to give such original or additional bond, his or her office shall be vacant. A bond furnished pursuant to the provisions of this section shall not be valid if signed by any other officer of the same municipality as surety thereon.

        There is no duty imposed by law upon individual selectboard members under this section to require bonds therein described, but collective action by the selectboard must be taken in the matter of requiring the bond. State v. Baldwin, 116 Vt. 112, 70 A.2d 242 (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        When one is elected constable it is duty of selectboard first to move in matter and require bond, to fix its amount and kind of security, and their neglect to require bond, not constable's neglect to give one, causes vacancy in office, if there be one. Weston v. Sprague, 54 Vt. 395 (1882).

       </h5>
       <p>
        One legally elected constable who serves as such though he has neglected to furnish bond within time prescribed by statute, selectboard never having required it, is a de facto, if not a de jure officer; and sureties on his bond given several months after his election are liable for his delinquencies in appropriating public funds to his own use. Weston v. Sprague, 54 Vt. 395 (1882).
       </p>
       <p>
        Service of writ by constable before he has given bail is valid, if made before any request for bail has been made of him by selectboard than inquiry "when he was going to give bail," and before any refusal on his part to give bail or any interference on the part of town with discharge of his official duties. Bank of Middlebury v. Rutland & Wash. R.R., 30 Vt. 159 (1858).
       </p>
       <p>
        Person elected constable may discharge his duties without having executed bond to town if it has not been required of him, or if its execution and delivery are delayed with the consent of selectboard, and he may legally act as constable until his office is vacated by selectboard on his refusal to execute bond to their satisfaction. Langdon v. Rutland & Wash. R.R., 29 Vt. 212 (1857).
       </p>
       <p>
        Constable derives his official powers from his election and statute defining his powers and he is not required to give bonds until selectboard of town specifies amount, name securities, and request due execution of bonds, and he can execute duties of office until these steps are taken.

        Prior demand of payment need not be averred in a suit upon a constable's or collector's official bond, nor need a proceeding be had to procure an extent against the collector himself, suit upon bond being cumulative remedy. Middlebury v. Nixon, 1 Vt. 232 (1828).

Even if this statute were found to apply to city officials, there is nothing in the statute creating a right of action and the statute imposes no duty on officials other than the duty to obtain a bond; here, there was no evidence as to whether the city official did or did not obtain a bond, so declaratory relief on this issue was not warranted.

         1. Nature of liability.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Liability of town is equally original and direct as that of delinquent town clerk or constable, and no previous recovery or suit against officer is necessary in order to perfect right of action against town for his default. Lyman v. Windsor, 24 Vt. 575 (1852).
       </p>
       <p>
        Town is liable for default of its constable, in first instance, and suit against constable is not indispensable to charge town. McGregor v. Walden, 14 Vt. 450 (1842); Bramble v. Poultney, 11 Vt. 208 (1839).

         2. Period of liability.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Town is liable under this section for neglect or default of constable, for property under attachment by him, so long as his duty as attaching officer continues, and duty of constable to care for property attached by him does not cease when his term of office expires. Lowell v. Stannard, 90 Vt. 443, 98 A. 925 (1916).
       </p>
       <p>
        Suits may be brought and maintained against town after death of constable for his default as such in service of processes during life. Martin v. Wells, 43 Vt. 428 (1871).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        To maintain suit against town under this section, for constable's neglect to complete attachment, enabling another creditor to secure priority by mortgage lien, attaching creditor need not obtain judgment in such suit against debtor, since record of such judgment would be inadmissible against town. Roberge v. Troy, 105 Vt. 134, 163 A. 770 (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        Action against town for neglect of constable in not levying, collecting, and returning execution cannot be sustained by proof of his having actually collected execution, but neglected to pay money to creditor. Barber v. Benson, 9 Vt. 171 (1837).

         4. Accrual of cause of action.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In action of tort against town for constable's neglect to complete attachment, plaintiff's cause of action arose when constable failed to complete attachment, and where, by reason of such neglect, another creditor obtained priority by mortgage lien, plaintiff could recover such actual damages as he sustained by officer's negligence, or nominal damages in any event. Roberge v. Troy, 105 Vt. 134, 163 A. 770 (1932).

         5. Neglect or default.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where property attached by constable was receipted for and, while in control of receiptor, sold by defendant, fact that constable thereupon took actual possession of goods remaining unsold, thereby releasing receiptor from further liability, was not, standing alone, such neglect or default as would make town of which constable was an officer liable under this section. Lowell v. Stannard, 90 Vt. 443, 98 A. 925 (1916).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is duty of town clerk to provide alphabet or index for book used for recording evidences respecting titles to lands or real estate, and to keep and preserve same with same truthfulness and care he is required to exercise in keeping books of record, and when injury has been sustained by anyone, by reason of neglect in this respect, town is liable. Hunter v. Windsor, 24 Vt. 327 (1852).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff in action against town and town clerk for breach of official duty of town clerk alleged that clerk refused to show record and concealed incumbrance in his official capacity, though allegedly inquired of in such capacity, cause of action was stated.

       <p>
        Where town sought mandamus to compel town clerk to discontinue photostatic process of recording instruments, and to recopy all records so made, defense of lack of sufficient interest to maintain action was unavailing, since town was liable for damages accruing through neglect or default of town clerk, under this section. Bennington v. Booth, 101 Vt. 24, 140 A. 157 (1927), (See

Roberge v. Troy, 105 Vt. 134, 163 A. 770 (1932).

        Because statute plainly excluded willful and intentional acts, town did not assume officer's place in grandfather's claims for false arrest, malicious prosecution, and intentional infliction of emotional distress and was shielded from liability by doctrine of municipal immunity; town was not shielded from liability for gross negligence claims, but those claims failed because officer did not owe grandfather legally enforceable duty of care.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Statute governing tort claims against municipal employees, which expressly waives municipal immunity and puts the town in the shoes of its employees in the context of claims for negligence, applied to claims stemming from the alleged negligence of a road commissioner. Civetti v. Turner, - Vt.
    - , 233 A.3d 1056 (Apr. 3, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Definition of "municipal employee" includes any person employed for a wage or salary by a municipality - as well as volunteers whose services have been formally requested by municipal officers, employees, or legislative bodies. This broad definition of "municipal employee" contains no qualification suggesting an intent to exclude people employed for a wage or salary by a municipality when they are statutory town officers. Civetti v. Turner, - Vt.
    - , 233 A.3d 1056 (Apr. 3, 2020).

        Selectboard has power to submit to arbitration any claims against the town, as it is authorized to audit and adjust; and town will be bound by award made in pursuance of such submission. Dix v. Dummerston, 19 Vt. 262 (1847).

        If town appoints agent to compromise disputed claim for damages on account of road laid across plaintiff's land by selectboard, such agent may refer question of amount to be paid to arbitrators; and town will be bound by award. Schoff v. Bloomfield, 8 Vt. 472 (1836).

        Where defendant's selectboard members, acting, as they supposed, in discharge of their official duty, paid large sum of money in endeavoring to ascertain liability of town upon its subscription in aid of railroad, presented items of their expenditure to town auditors, who found that expenditures were made, and issued orders upon town treasurer to themselves, or bearer, for their reimbursement, such orders did not bind the town, since it was no part of auditors' duty to audit and allow such claims, and since selectboard members, who being themselves claimants and therefore in no position to represent adverse interests of the town, had no authority to draw them.

        Charge that clerk in indexing records of deeds must provide suitable index, "of such a kind as a man of ordinary intelligence, of fair business capacity, would require to make a search. It is not necessary that the index, or alphabet, should be one that all men could take and at once find a record. The law does not go to that extent. All that is required, is, that it shall be such an index . . . as would enable a man understanding the plan on which the index was made up, and having ordinary, fair business capacity, to take it, and thereby find the record he was in search of," was not in error.

       <p>
        Key to proper notice, in the context of a name index, is the proper spelling of the debtor's name and the resulting proper alphabetical placement. Applying idem sonans to a name index would defeat the purpose of the index; therefore, when a judgment misspelled the debtor's last name, causing the recorded judgment to be indexed under the wrong spelling and to be missed during an index search, the doctrine of idem sonans did not allow enforcement of a judgment lien. Lively v. Northfield Sav. Bank, 182 Vt. 428, 940 A.2d 700 (Oct. 5, 2007).

        Laying out and establishing limits and bounds of village in these words: "Commencing with Samuel Hall, thence to William Scales, also including John W. Dana, Jason and Warren Britt and Thomas Lyford," - was uncertain and insufficient; it must be so described as to include territory, with certain outlines and boundaries. Cutting v.

        Until State institutes proceedings by which municipal corporation organized under color of law is suppressed, it exists de facto and public functions with which it is charged, within the scope of its apparent powers, may be lawfully performed by its officials as de facto officers.

        17, reserving to Legislature the authority to entertain petitions for altering town and county lines and creating new towns, is that Legislature delegated authority to locate, as distinguished from alter, the true line to selectboard of adjoining towns and, failing in that, has authorized location of charter line by county courts.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Acquiescence in a wrong boundary, whatever its duration, will not change the true division line established in the legislative grant nor cause the charter line to give way; recognition and concurrence by the towns in a boundary at variance with a line established by legislative grant, as a matter of law, cannot prevail over the line established by the charters. Town of Brookline v. Town of Newfane, 126 Vt. 179, 224 A.2d 908 (1966); Town of Putney v. Town of Brookline, 126 Vt. 194, 225 A.2d 388 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the true division is uncertain or obscure, historic observance of a boundary marked upon the ground, coupled with acquiescence long endured has probative value to indicate where the charter line might be found. Town of Brookline v. Town of Newfane, 126 Vt. 179, 224 A.2d 908 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        While acquiescence in a boundary alone can have no prescriptive effect nor transfer any territory, it may have evidentiary value in the search for the location of the true boundary. Town of Brookline v. Town of Newfane, 126 Vt. 179, 224 A.2d 908 (1966).

      The plan of merger shall include provisions relating to structure, organization, functions, operation, finance, property, and other appropriate matters; shall include special provisions contained in a charter of any municipality included in the plan, which provisions are peculiar to that municipality, and which it is desired to retain as charter provisions of the consolidated municipality; and shall include adequate provisions for the satisfaction of all obligations of the parties concerned.
    The plan shall provide that any area or group of voters in the consolidated municipality or town may have special services, not common to all the voters in the municipality or town, provided for them, if so voted.
    All costs of whatever nature required to support these special services shall be paid for by the taxpayers receiving these services, by a tax on their grand list, to be assessed annually by the selectboard or the equivalent officers of a municipality, or in such other manner as the selectboard or the equivalent officers of a municipality shall determine.
    If the costs are to be paid by a tax, such tax shall be paid and collected in the same manner as other taxes and such tax assessed on their grand list shall be a lien thereon.

        1976 amendments reorganized the abatement statute by dividing it into subsections and adding some separate grounds for abatement, and it appears that the Legislature intended merely to streamline existing language by removing surplus words in the clause providing for abatement where there is error or mistake. Thus, it is incorrect to conclude that a manifest error must be attributable to the listers. Garbitelli v. Town of Brookfield, 191 Vt. 76, 38 A.3d 1133 (2011).

         2. Equity.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Tax abatement is an equitable remedy, and thus the maxim that a party seeking an equitable remedy must come to court with clean hands is fully applicable. Equity denotes the spirit of fairness, justness, and right dealing; a court has great discretion to deny aid to the unclean litigant and can refuse to be the abetter of iniquity. Garbitelli v. Town of Brookfield, 191 Vt. 76, 38 A.3d 1133 (2011).

         3. Abatement properly denied.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In an abatement proceeding, the board was entitled to weigh the equities and take into account any bad conduct of taxpayer, and it found that the taxpayer engaged in unfair and inequitable conduct by refusing the listers reasonable access to the property. The board properly considered the taxpayer's conduct, and there was no abuse of its discretion in denying his abatement request on this ground. Garbitelli v. Town of Brookfield, 191 Vt. 76, 38 A.3d 1133 (2011).

       <p>
        Taxpayer who sought to appeal a tax abatement denial was entitled to review in the Civil Division. Murray v. City of Burlington, 191 Vt. 597, 44 A.3d 162 (mem.) (2012).

         5. Sufficiency of claim.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Taxpayer had made a sufficient showing to survive dismissal of her appeal from denial of a tax abatement. When taken as a whole, the allegations involved a request for abatement insofar as she alleged that her taxes were illegally assessed because the city knew that the property was contaminated, but treated it otherwise; further, the taxpayer claimed that the taxes were manifestly unjust because the city's abatement process was not impartial and lacked due process. Murray v. City of Burlington, 191 Vt. 597, 44 A.3d 162 (mem.) (2012).

         6. Detail of decision.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Board of abatement's decision must provide sufficient explanation to indicate to the parties, and to an appellate court, what was decided and upon what considerations. The writing need not be lengthy, exhaustive, or legalistic, and need not satisfy the standards the appellate court would apply to a trial court's findings, but it must address the arguments raised by the applicant, and the more detailed and clear a taxpayer's own presentation, the greater the board's duty to respond in kind. Guntlow v. Bd. of Abatement, 198 Vt. 174, 112 A.3d 732 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Board of abatement's responses that the "delinquent-tax collector could not take a portion of payment towards one parcel on a tax bill, being in the hands of the attorney," that "the elimination of the house site is based on the income and is handled by the State," and that "the same cost table/schedule were used to value the property as were to the rest of the parcels in town" were sufficiently detailed reasons for its decision. Guntlow v. Bd. of Abatement, 198 Vt. 174, 112 A.3d 732 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Board of abatement's decision was not sufficiently detailed when, with respect to the taxpayers' argument that the listers improperly and without notice reclassified their property to an inapplicable and less advantageous status, the board stated, "No, it was not proven by the appellant that the listers had erred," as this response amounted to "you are wrong," without any explanation why, and when another response failed to address the years 2005 to 2010.

        A town order in these words, "The treasurer of the town of Whitingham is directed to pay to W. H. Follett or bearer, ten dollars and eighty-six cents on demand, Jan. 7, 1851," has all the elements of negotiable paper, and when such orders are drawn, presented for payment, and payment refused, they are negotiable, and can be prosecuted in the name of the indorsee.

    1, provides: "The distribution of the auditor's report of a town to residents of the state of Vermont is an important way to communicate to Vermonters how their local governments function. In addition, when combined with a town report, the distribution of the auditor's report informs town residents of the work of boards, committees, and individuals who are critical to the quality of civic life in Vermont communities. This information can help inspire and encourage community involvement. This bill allows towns to consider effective means of making their auditors' reports and town reports available to voters or residents. The legislature encourages towns to reach out actively to residents and voters to inform them of their town government and associated civic activities."

       If a municipal corporation votes to issue bonds in accordance with law, the officers authorized to issue the same, upon resolution of the legislative branch of the municipal corporation, may make a temporary loan, in the name of such municipal corporation, for a period of not more than one year in anticipation of the money to be derived from the sale of such bonds and may issue notes therefore.
    Temporary notes issued under this subsection for a shorter period than one year may be renewed or refunded by the issue of other notes maturing not more than one year from the date of the original loan except as stated in subsection (b) of this section.
    The maximum maturity date of the authorized bond issue need not be reduced because of a temporary loan hereunder except as stated in subsection (b) of this section.

       A temporary note issued under subsection (a) of this section may be renewed or refunded to mature more than one year from the date of the original temporary loan.
    In such a case, the authorized amount of the bond issue shall be reduced each year or portion thereof after the first year during which the temporary loan remains outstanding by a factor at least equal to the amount which will reduce the authorized amount of bonds to zero through equal annual payments over the maximum maturity allowed by law for such bonds, or such lesser maturity as may be determined by the legislative branch of the municipality.
    The amount of the temporary loan outstanding at any time shall not exceed the current authorized amount of the bond issue.
    The legislative branch of the municipal corporation shall, in each year in excess of any one year period, include in the next annual apportionment or assessment of taxes an amount equal to the amount of the reduction to be used either for the purpose of the original authorized bond issue or to satisfy the temporary note.

       Pending the receipt of revenue in the form of grants-in-aid from any source, a municipal corporation through its legislative branch, by resolution or ordinance, may issue revenue anticipation notes in anticipation of the grants-in-aid to be received.

    Nevertheless, no public improvement which has been voted upon in the method provided by sections 1755 and 1756 of this title shall be voted upon in any such meeting, except in cases of emergency, in which the vote stating the emergency shall be conclusive evidence of its existence.
    The existing power of a municipality to refund obligations representing indebtedness accumulated in the ordinary administration of the affairs of such municipality, whether incurred for public improvements or for current expenses, and with or without vote of such municipality, is not repealed nor affected by the provisions of this subchapter, except that the method of such refunding shall be as provided in sections 1771 and 1772 of this title.

      <li id="t24p02c53sub05s1891ol15">
       "Original taxable value" means the total valuation as determined in accordance with 32 V.S.A. chapter 129 of all taxable real property located within the tax increment financing district as of the creation date as set forth in section 1892 of this subchapter, provided that no parcel within the district shall be divided or bisected by the district boundary.

Payment for the cost of district improvements may also include direct payment by the municipality using the district increment. However, such payment is also subject to a vote by the legal voters of the municipality in accordance with section 1894 of this subchapter and, if not included in the tax increment financing plan approved under subsection 1894(d) of this subchapter, is also considered a substantial change and subject to the review process provided by subdivision 1901(2)(B) of this subchapter. If interfund loans within the municipality are used as the method of financing, no interest shall be charged.

        In as much as Gadue may be read to require some form of disability as predicate for termination of a police officer for cause, that aspect of the decision is overruled. Hubacz v. Village of Waterbury, 207 Vt. 399, 187 A.3d 367 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the grounds for termination listed in the statute governing a police officer's negligence or dereliction of duty may satisfy a cause standard, this does not preclude a police officer's termination for cause based upon factors not delineated in the statute. Hubacz v. Village of Waterbury, 207 Vt. 399, 187 A.3d 367 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Police officer may be terminated for cause when the State's Attorney unilaterally decides not to prosecute the officer's cases if, as a result of that nonprosecution decision, the officer is unable to perform the duties of his employment; however, a prosecutor's decision not to prosecute a police officer's cases may only serve as the basis for termination for cause where the police department involved cannot reasonably accommodate the effect of the prosecutor's decision, and a State's Attorney's decision not to prosecute a particular police officer's cases must be premised on valid grounds. Hubacz v. Village of Waterbury, 207 Vt. 399, 187 A.3d 367 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prosecutor's determination that Brady requires the disclosure of damaging impeachment evidence regarding a particular police officer can provide valid grounds for the prosecutor's nonprosecution decision. Whether that nonprosecution decision may provide cause for the police officer's termination in a given case is a separate consideration; that consideration requires a finding that the officer in question cannot fulfill the duties associated with his employment and cannot be reassigned in such a way as to accommodate the nonprosecution decision. Hubacz v. Village of Waterbury, 207 Vt. 399, 187 A.3d 367 (2018).

       <p>
        In a Fair Labor Standards Act case, a police chief misread the Vermont statute regarding police officers as giving Vermont police chiefs the power to hire and fire personnel free from the supervision of town government. Read together, subsections (a) and (b) envision a police department created by town government, the operations of which are directed by a chief, but which is concurrently and ultimately subject to the authority of town government; by itself, subsection (b) means simply that the chief of police is in charge of the other people who work at the police department. Turnley v. Town of Vernon, 192 Vt. 238, 58 A.3d 215 (2012).

       <p>
        Police chief's failure to publicly disseminate information regarding a low-level sex offender could not, in and of itself, constitute dereliction because it did not implicate the performance of a specific duty. Turnley v. Town of Vernon, 194 Vt. 42, 71 A.3d 1246 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Simple misstatements without intent to mislead do not constitute conduct unbecoming a law enforcement officer in circumstances where the misstatements themselves - rather than negligent job performance - constitute the alleged cause for firing. Turnley v. Town of Vernon, 194 Vt. 42, 71 A.3d 1246 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Wide range of behavior - public or private - may qualify as conduct unbecoming an officer of the law. Generally speaking, one requires higher standards of conduct from law-enforcement officials than one might of people in other professions. Turnley v. Town of Vernon, 194 Vt. 42, 71 A.3d 1246 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Lying and a reputation for dishonesty would compromise a police chief's ability to carry out his official duties. A reputation for dishonesty also would diminish public respect in a way that would bear on departmental morale. Turnley v. Town of Vernon, 194 Vt. 42, 71 A.3d 1246 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because a selectboard's findings or lack thereof with respect to the allegation that a police chief knowingly and deliberately misled the public were ambiguous, they could not support the board's determination to fire the chief for conduct unbecoming an officer under the officer-tenure statute.

       <p>
        Where probationary police officers were, by statute, excluded from the protections granted tenured police officers under the statute, probationary police officer who was laid off could not be reinstated, even though the layoff was for a reason other than that allowed by this section and a fellow, tenured, officer had to be reinstated for that reason. Audette v. Greer, 134 Vt. 300, 360 A.2d 66 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Conclusion that police officer's discharge was not due to economic necessity was supported by evidence that, though it was alleged that protection contract with nearby town had been terminated, resulting in a $ 1,000 per month payment loss, and that the force was too large and had accrued undue overtime, in fact, the police budget had been overspent in the prior three years and no layoffs had occurred, the village was well within its general and police budgets and the force had not increased when the terminated protection contract had gone into effect.

        Since town's charter provided that all State statutes relating to municipalities applied to the town unless modified by charter, ordinance, or rule, and further provided that all general laws relative to town government should be in force unless inconsistent with the town's charter, this chapter applied to the town as a general law relative to town government unless and to the extent not superseded by charter, ordinance, or rule and therefore, the town's charter had provisions "providing for" tenure of police during good behavior, hearing, and removal only for cause as required by this section, providing that State statutory dismissal procedure would control removal of police officers unless municipality had contrary charter provisions; if Legislature had intended to require that municipalities enact specific procedures for removal of police officers into the body of their charters, it would have said so.

        Statute pertaining to intermunicipal police services states that various municipalities "may" enter into agreements for the provision of police services, and does not mandate a bidding process. The plain, ordinary meaning of the word "may" indicates that a statute is permissive, not mandatory; thus, municipalities have discretion to enter into agreements for the provision of law enforcement services and may choose the provider in their own manner.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Sheriff's office lacked constitutional standing to assert a predatory pricing claim against a police department in part because it had no legally protected right to "fair competition" with other statutorily created government entities to provide police services to a town. The town was under no obligation to entertain bids for police services in the first instance, or to award the contract to the lowest bidder. Franklin County Sheriff's Office v. St. Albans City Police Dep't, 192 Vt. 188, 58 A.3d 207 (2012).

        Collateral estoppel does not bar the plaintiff's claim of action concerning lined landfills; similar litigation was focused on unlined landfills but Vermont statutes make a distinction between the two, and such distinction is relevant enough to preserve plaintiff's claim. Valley Disposal, Inc. v. Central Vermont Solid Waste Management District, 31 F.3d 89 (2d Cir. 1994).

         6. Contracts.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Town's ability to pledge its cooperation to further the goals of a host town agreement with a solid waste district was implicit in the town's statutorily authorized ability to exercise its powers to contract with third parties for the siting, construction, and operation of waste disposal facilities. Gade v. Chittenden Solid Waste Dist., 187 Vt. 7, 989 A.2d 491 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        All that a town did was promise to support a solid waste district in its permit applications and give its warranty of good faith with regard to the town plan; the agreement did not promise the success of these applications and explicitly left all independent permitting procedures intact. The town's actions did not amount to a delegation of any legislatively derived power; further, the town was exercising the very power that the Legislature explicitly intended it to exercise. Gade v. Chittenden Solid Waste Dist., 187 Vt. 7, 989 A.2d 491 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont Legislature has authorized municipalities to enter into contracts with a waste disposal district for the siting and management of landfills; it is the Legislature's intent to support long-term contracts between municipalities and third parties for the management of waste disposal. Indeed, the purpose of the applicable statutes is to encourage towns to develop long-term plans for the disposal of solid waste that are safe, efficient, and environmentally sound. Gade v. Chittenden Solid Waste Dist., 187 Vt. 7, 989 A.2d 491 (2009).

         1. Purpose.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Legislature did not intend that this section, specifying the provisions for a local option trailer park ordinance where the municipality had not enacted "a zoning ordinance" under chapter 67 of this title, would prevent a municipality which had previously adopted a zoning ordinance that did not regulate and license mobile home parks from enacting a trailer park ordinance under section 2231 of this title. City of Rutland v. Keiffer, 124 Vt. 357, 205 A.2d 400 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trailer park ordinance enacted by municipality pursuant to this section and section 2231 of this title required that owner of pre-existing trailer park apply for and obtain a license as specified in the ordinance. City of Rutland v. Keiffer, 124 Vt. 357, 205 A.2d 400 (1964).

        The zoning law under chapter 67 of this title and this section and section 2231 of this title concerning regulation and licensing of trailer and mobile home parks are pari materia. City of Rutland v. Keiffer, 124 Vt. 357, 205 A.2d 400 (1964).

         3. Law governing.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The status of an individual trailer unit as a dwelling house under original zoning ordinance is solely dependent upon interpretation of original ordinance, unaided by any definition in a subsequent amendment. City of Rutland v. Keiffer, 124 Vt. 357, 205 A.2d 400 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where original zoning ordinance did not regulate house trailer or mobile home parks and specified that renting of space for automobile trailers was a permissible use, original ordinance did not apply to individual units in trailer park and defendant's trailer park was therefore in compliance with original ordinance if the park as a whole met set-back and side yard provisions of the ordinance. City of Rutland v. Keiffer, 124 Vt. 357, 205 A.2d 400 (1964).

         4. Legislative intent.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where there was no reference to house trailers or mobile home parks in original zoning ordinance, and amendment specifically related to house trailers and mobile home parks, it is clear that there was no intention in the original ordinance to regulate or control house trailer or mobile home parks. City of Rutland v. Keiffer, 124 Vt. 357, 205 A.2d 400 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Legislature meant "enacted such a zoning ordinance" when it provided under this section that the trailer ordinance would be substantially as specified in municipalities that have not "enacting a zoning ordinance", and intended by this provision to refer to a zoning ordinance that regulated and licensed trailer parks. City of Rutland v. Keiffer, 124 Vt. 357, 205 A.2d 400 (1964).

      At the hearing regarding location of the salvage yard, the legislative body may also take into account the clean, wholesome, and attractive environment which has been declared to be of vital importance to the continued stability and development of the tourist and recreational industry of the State and the general welfare of its citizens by considering whether or not the proposed location can be reasonably protected from having an unfavorable effect thereon. In this regard the legislative body may consider collectively the type of road servicing the salvage yard or from which the salvage yard may be seen, the natural or artificial barriers protecting the salvage yard from view, the proximity of the proposed salvage yard to established tourist and recreational areas or main access routes, thereto, proximity to neighboring residences, groundwater resources, surface waters, wetlands, drinking water supplies, consistency with an adopted town plan, as well as the reasonable availability of other suitable sites for the salvage yard.

        Town ordinance setting town speed limit at State speed limit was at most a post hoc adoption of the existing speed limit under State law, whose sole effect was to divert to the town fines that would otherwise flow to the State, in short, a revenue-raising measure neither expressly nor impliedly authorized by the Legislature and thus invalid.

        Ordinance imposing a tax upon admissions to entertainments or amusements, proceeds of which were to be placed in the general fund to be used for general purposes, was clearly for the sole purpose of raising revenue, did not bear a real and substantial relationship to the public health, safety, welfare, and convenience, which were the purposes for which statute allowed taxation of amusements and entertainments, and was therefore invalid.

        One purpose of the 2006 amendment to the statute enumerating municipal powers was to prohibit municipalities from regulating the discharge of firearms, including regulation of the noise created by such discharge, in a way that limits or reduces the permissible amount of shooting below those levels established as of May 22, 2006.

       </p>
       <p>
        Based on the plain language of the statute enumerating the powers of a municipality as well as the history of the 2006 amendment to the statute, the statute prohibited a town from enforcing its noise ordinance with respect to noise generated by discharge of firearms that was consistent with a sport shooting range's established amount of shooting as of May 22, 2006. Thus, as long as the range's operations were consistent with the historical operation of the range, using the May 22, 2006 baseline, the town could not cite the range for violating its noise ordinance. N. Country Sportsman's Club v. Town of Williston, 205 Vt. 1, 170 A.3d 639 (2017).

        Because a union municipal district owned or leased all of the land within its boundaries, its management practices had the effect of banning hunting and trapping throughout those boundaries, but the Legislature has not prohibited the district from managing its land in that way. Thus, the district's actions in posting its own land to ban hunting and trapping were not only affirmatively authorized by the Legislature, but also free of any statutory or constitutional prohibition.

       </h5>
       <p>
        In a condemnation case involving a solid waste district, the trial court properly denied the landowner's motion to amend the final judgment without a hearing when the landowner was given multiple opportunities to proffer evidence upon which a jury could evaluate whether a sand pit increased materially in value between the date of valuation and the date of the tender of compensation, but repeatedly failed to provide evidentiary support for its request to amend the final judgment. The judge was similarly within her discretion to deny the landowner's motion for reconsideration, which the landowner submitted without any timely supporting evidence.

        On the issue of damages available to the property owner in cases involving condemnation by solid waste management districts, the governing statute is identical to that for condemnation generally. Thus, preexisting case law on damages is available in a proceeding for condemnation of a sand pit to create a solid waste landfill.

       </p>
       <p>
        Except for determining that a condemnor had in fact met the procedural requirements for filing a condemnation petition, the court lacked authority to dismiss the petition based on whether the petitioner had adequately considered the statutory factors in seeking condemnation or in setting forth the compensation to be paid, within the meaning of 24 V.S.A.
        ยง
        2299c(a); hence, the scope of the court's proceeding was beyond its statutory authority, and its resultant order was invalid. In re Chittenden Solid Waste District, 163 Vt. 185, 657 A.2d 197 (1995).

        In ordering that sand be made available to landfill condemnee if it chose to take it, court did not bind condemnee to any conditions subsequent to condemnation, but instead was merely adhering to legislative mandate that court consider and give effect to policy of protecting earth resources; proposal to make sand available to condemnee following condemnation was therefore authorized by statute. Chittenden Solid Waste District v. Hinesburg Sand & Gravel Co., 169 Vt. 153, 730 A.2d 614 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although trial court in condemnation proceeding determined that it need not reassess issue of necessity for landfill due to legislative findings on that issue, court went on to make requisite statutory findings of necessity to support locating landfill within county at site in question.

       </p>
       <p>
        Under the Landfill Condemnation Statute, there are two distinct judicial condemnation stages: (1) the judicial determination of necessity (at both the trial and appellate levels); and (2) the judicial determination of damages (also at both the trial and appellate levels); each stage is a single, unified proceeding. In re Chittenden Solid Waste District, 163 Vt. 185, 657 A.2d 197 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Landfill Condemnation Statute clearly mandates that necessity be tried and appealed first, while damages are tried and appealed thereafter, consistent with the judicial condemnation process in place in many other states.

       <p>
        Lease of school lands that did not have provision for term "as long as grass grows or water runs," or equivalent words, was not so-called durable or perpetual lease as such leases have been defined from early days of this jurisdiction, and since no term was specified and rent was payable annually, tenancy was from year to year. Johnson v. Selectmen of Salisbury, 120 Vt. 6, 132 A.2d 423 (1957).
       </p>
       <p>
        Authority conveyed by statute upon towns and university to lease gospel, school, and college lands includes the power to execute so-called durable leases, for "as long as grass grows and water runs," with covenants for rent and a right of reentry for breach of condition. Jones v. Vermont Asbestos Corp., 108 Vt. 79, 182 A. 291 (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court will take judicial notice as matter of common knowledge that from early days of Vermont, greater part of public lands have been leased by "durable leases," that is, by leases reserving rent payable annually, with right of re-entry for nonpayment of rent, and for term "as long as grass grows or water runs," or equivalent terms. University of Vermont v. Ward, 104 Vt. 239, 158 A. 773 (1931).

        Legislature has power to authorize trustees of public lands to execute leases thereof with terms coextensive with life of trust, that is, forever. University of Vermont v. Ward, 104 Vt. 239, 158 A. 773 (1931).
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislative history shows it was legislative intent that durable leases of public lands should create relation of landlord and tenant, between parties, and that they are valid leases on long terms and not conveyances in fee. University of Vermont v. Ward, 104 Vt. 239, 158 A. 773 (1931).

        Income from land granted to Town of Franklin, under its charter, for the support of the ministry, could not be distributed to any religious organization where town held title to land and income was thus public money; such direct municipal subsidy of religion was unconstitutional under First Amendment, and income was henceforth to become part of general revenue of the town.

        Owner of lot abutting on street has property right to shade trees in front of premises, sufficient to enable him to maintain action for damages against tree warden who cut and removed them without complying with statutory provision for hearing in relation thereto, even though fee of street was in public, basis of recovery being injury resulting to abutting property thereby.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Although shade trees within limits of public way or place in village are to be deemed public shade trees, and, with exception of those in public parks and places under control of park commissioners, are under care and control of village's tree warden, latter cannot justify cutting and removal of such trees merely because of his official position and that he acted in good faith believing the trees dangerous to public, where he failed to comply with statutory requirements of this section respecting a public hearing thereon, and violated the statutory inhibition against action without such hearing. Skinner v. Buchanan, 101 Vt. 159, 142 A. 72 (1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        In action against tree warden of village by owner of lot abutting street for cutting and removing two shade trees therein in front of his premises, claim of tree warden that his decision as to advisability of cutting or removing tree was made final by this section, and thus failure to comply with statute respecting public hearing was therefore of no consequence, was untenable, since such hearing might cause warden to reach different conclusion, and, also, because his decision could be reviewed by selectboard or trustees upon request in writing of party in interest. Skinner v. Buchanan, 101 Vt. 159, 142 A. 72 (1928).

      At a meeting duly warned for that purpose, a town or incorporated village may appropriate such sums of money as it deems necessary for the support of social service programs and facilities within that town for its residents. Social service programs, for which a town or incorporated village may appropriate sums of money, include: transportation, nutrition, medical, child care, and other rehabilitative services for persons with low incomes, elders, children, persons with disabilities, persons with a substance use disorder, and persons requiring employment to eliminate their need for public assistance. The authority herein granted is not in derogation of other local powers to allocate funds.

        <li id="t24p02c76As2790ol1a1">
         Economically strong downtowns are critical to the health and well-being of Vermont's communities and that downtowns are the natural location for both small businesses and other uses that together constitute the diverse fabric of communities that define Vermont's quality of life.

        <li id="t24p02c76As2790ol1a2">
         Vermont's distinctive character of historic downtowns and villages surrounded by working landscapes is recognized worldwide. This character defines Vermont's image, economy, and sense of place as well as its community spirit and identity, which are enjoyed by residents and visitors alike. This distinctive character is among our most valuable assets, and investing in its health is a critical component of the State's overall economic well-being. The General Assembly recognizes the particular importance of Vermont's downtowns as historic regional centers providing services and amenities to nonresidents and further recognizes their need for targeted support in avoiding continued loss of commercial and residential land use to the surrounding area.
        </li>
        <li id="t24p02c76As2790ol1a3">
         Investments made to revitalize the State's historic downtowns and village centers, to encourage pedestrian-oriented development within and around the commercial core, and to build upon the State's traditional settlement patterns support statewide goals concerning energy conservation, the efficient use of transportation and other public infrastructure and services, the protection of the working landscape, and the promotion of healthy lifestyles.

         support historic downtowns and villages by providing funding, training, and resources to communities designated under this chapter, to revitalize such communities, to increase and diversify economic development activities, to improve the efficient use of public investments, including water and sewer systems, and to safeguard working landscapes;
        </li>
        <li id="t24p02c76As2790ol1b2">
         improve the ability of Vermont's historic downtowns and villages to attract residents and businesses by enhancing their livability and unique sense of place; by expanding access to employment, housing, education and schools, services, public facilities, and other basic needs; and by expanding businesses' access to markets;
        </li>
        <li id="t24p02c76As2790ol1b3">
         coordinate policies and leverage funding to support historic downtowns and villages by removing barriers to collaboration among local downtown organizations, municipal departments, local businesses, and local nonprofit organizations and increasing accountability and effectiveness at all levels of government to revitalize communities and plan for future growth;
        </li>
        <li id="t24p02c76As2790ol1b4">
         promote healthy, safe, and walkable downtown and village neighborhoods for people of all ages and incomes by increasing investments in those locations; providing energy efficient housing that is closer to jobs, services, health care, stores, entertainment, and schools; and reducing the combined cost of housing and transportation;

        <li id="t24p02c76As2790ol1b5">

       The General Assembly finds that Vermont's communities face challenges as they seek to accommodate growth and development while supporting the economic vitality of the State's downtowns, village centers, and new town centers and maintaining the rural character and working landscape of the surrounding countryside. While it is the intention of the General Assembly to give the highest priority to facilitating development and growth in downtowns and village centers whenever feasible, when that is not feasible, the General Assembly further finds that:
       <ol>
        <li id="t24p02c76As2790ol1d1">
         A large percentage of future growth should occur within duly designated growth centers that have been planned by municipalities in accordance with smart growth principles and Vermont's planning and development goals pursuant to section 4302 of this title.
        </li>
        <li id="t24p02c76As2790ol1d2">
         Designated growth centers, if properly located and scaled, will serve to support the State's downtowns, village centers, and new town centers by encouraging new residential neighborhoods and compatible civic, commercial, and industrial uses to locate within proximity to historic community centers.
        </li>
        <li id="t24p02c76As2790ol1d3">
         Designated growth centers will provide a cost-effective means of allocating and targeting limited municipal and State resources to those areas specifically planned to accommodate and support concentrated development and a large percentage of future growth.
        </li>
        <li id="t24p02c76As2790ol1d4">
         Designated growth centers will provide a mechanism for concentrating private investment in those areas targeted for growth and development through public investments and incentives, and by establishing a process that will effectively reduce cost and delay in the permitting and approval of development.
        </li>
        <li id="t24p02c76As2790ol1d5">
         Designated growth centers will accomplish these goals if they are economically viable, they are appropriately planned to accommodate future growth needs and a mix of uses, they originate at the municipal or regional level, and they are recognized by the State under State planning, financing, and permitting programs.

The appeal shall be taken within five days after the receipt of the inspector's notice and order by the aggrieved party or his or her architect or builder. In case of an election to appeal to a board of arbitrators, it shall be deemed perfected by a written notice of appeal left with the building inspector personally, or at his or her office. In case of an election to appeal to the Criminal Division of the Superior Court, the appeal shall be deemed perfected by the filing with the court of a complaint. The taking of the appeal shall operate as a stay.

      A municipality for the purposes of this chapter may formulate for the municipality a workable program for utilizing appropriate private and public resources to eliminate and prevent the development or spread of slums and urban blight, to encourage needed urban rehabilitation, to provide for the redevelopment of slum and blighted areas, or to undertake such of the aforesaid activities or other feasible municipal activities as may be suitably employed to achieve the objectives of such workable program.
    Such workable program may include provision for: the prevention of the spread of blight into areas of the municipality which are free from blight through diligent enforcement of housing, zoning, and occupancy controls and standards; the rehabilitation or conservation of slum and blighted areas or portions thereof by re-planning, removing congestion, providing parks, playgrounds, and other public improvements, by encouraging voluntary rehabilitation and by compelling the repair and rehabilitation of deteriorated or deteriorating structures; and the clearance and redevelopment of slum and blighted areas or portions thereof.

      The municipal corporation may agree with the owner or owners of any property, franchise, easement, or right that may be required by the municipal corporation for the purposes of this chapter, as to the compensation to be paid. In case of failure to agree as to the compensation, or in case the owner is an infant, a person who lacks capacity to protect his or her interests due to a mental condition or psychiatric disability, absent from the State, unknown, or the owner of a contingent interest, the Superior Court within and for the county where the subject property is situated on the petition of either party, may cause the notice to be given of the petition as the presiding judge of the court may prescribe. After proof thereof, the presiding judge may appoint three disinterested persons as commissioners to examine the property to be taken or damaged by the municipal corporation. The commissioners after being duly sworn, upon due notice to all parties in interest, shall view the premises, hear the parties in respect to the property, and shall assess and award to the owners and persons so interested just damages for any injury sustained and make report in writing to the presiding judge. The presiding judge may accept the report, unless just cause is shown to the contrary. The presiding judge may order the municipal corporation to pay the same in the time and manner as he or she may prescribe, in full compensation for the property taken, or the injury done by the municipal corporation, or the presiding judge may reject or recommit the report if the ends of justice so require. On compliance with the order, the municipal corporation may proceed with the construction of its work without liability for further claim for damages. The presiding judge may award costs in the proceeding in his or her discretion. The cause may be transferred to the Supreme Court as provided in <cite class="vt-code">12 V.S.A. ยง 4601</cite>.

         1. Reasonableness of rates.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Developer did not show that charges for reserved water capacity were unreasonable if they were not based on actual cost, as the statute does not require the village to base its fees on actual use or the associated marginal costs. The village had a finite water supply, and it had deemed it proper to charge fees for water reservations to discourage speculators and to discourage individuals from holding on to such reservations unnecessarily and unreasonably; it applied its fees uniformly and in a nondiscriminatory manner. Vt. N. Props. v. Village of Derby Ctr., 197 Vt. 130, 102 A.3d 1084 (2014).

         2. Setting of rates.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Because the statute that regulated municipal water rates afforded a village broad discretion in setting its rates, and permitted the city that purchased water from the village to account for the operating costs generated by unused capacity in the rate schedule, the trial court's conclusion that the statute did not permit ready-to-serve fees as a matter of law was erroneous. City of Newport v. Village of Derby Ctr., 197 Vt. 560, 109 A.3d 412 (2014).

         3. Notice.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        There was no merit to a city's argument that a village did not provide it proper notice of a water rate increase incurred through its imposition of a ready-to-serve fee, as under both the agreement and the statute that regulated municipal water rates, the ready-to-serve fee was part of the rate schedule that the village could reasonably charge, and neither the contract nor the statute required specific notice of the new rates to be charged. A letter from the village specifically referenced the agreement and clearly stated that water rates would be increased, and the passage of a 2006 ordinance imposing the ready-to-serve fee provided additional constructive notice of the rate changes. City of Newport v. Village of Derby Ctr., 197 Vt. 560, 109 A.3d 412 (2014).

       Within 60 days after the Secretary of State notifies the clerks of the member towns that the requirements of section 3342 of this title have been met, the voters in the consolidated water district shall meet and organize the district. The meeting shall be warned by the chair of the legislative body of each town of the district or by a member designated by his or her respective board to act in the chair's stead. The warning shall state the day, hour, and place within the district where the meeting will be held and shall be posted in not less than six public places in the district, including at least two public places within each member town, and shall be published three times in a newspaper circulating in the district, the last publication to be at least six days previous to the day of the meeting. The meeting shall be called to order by the clerk of the town in which the meeting is held, at which time a temporary presiding officer and clerk shall be elected from among the qualified voters. At such organizational meeting or an adjournment of the meeting, the district shall elect a moderator and a permanent clerk; shall determine the number of water commissioners constituting the board of water commissioners; and shall elect a board of water commissioners, who shall be the legislative branch, a treasurer, and three auditors. All officers elected at the organizational meeting shall hold office until others are elected and qualified following the first annual meeting. The selectboard of each town may appoint an alternative water commissioner for each commissioner elected from that town, whose duty shall be to serve in place of the elected commissioner if the latter is unable to serve, resigns, or is unable to proceed in office. The total number of water commissioners and the member from each member town may be agreed upon by the several member towns in advance of the organizational meeting. In the absence of such agreement, the number shall be set by the organizational meeting at not less than three nor more than 11 commissioners, including at least one from each member town. Changes in the total number of commissioners may be made at any annual meeting of the district duly warned for that purpose by vote of two-thirds of those present and voting; except that it shall always include at least one from each member town. Water commissioners elected at the organizational meeting shall be elected from nominations made by the several towns at their most recent annual or special meeting, if such nominations have been made. Water commissioners to serve on the board of water commissioners of the consolidated district following the first annual meeting shall be elected by the member towns at their own annual or special meetings. Such elections shall be by Australian ballot in those member towns that elect their respective legislative branches by Australian ballot. All other consolidated water district officers shall be elected by the consolidated district. When there is only one nominee for any of the offices, the voters may, by acclamation, instruct an officer to elect that nominee by casting one ballot, and upon the ballot being cast the nominee shall be declared to be legally elected.

       At such organizational meeting or at an adjournment of the meeting, the district may further authorize its board of water commissioners to pay any expense incurred by or on behalf of the district in the period between the date on which the member towns voted to join the district and the first annual meeting of the district. The word "expense" as used in this chapter shall include the cost of architects, surveyors, engineers, contractors, lawyers, or other consultants or experts as well as current operating expenses to be incurred by the district from its organizational meeting until its first annual meeting. The district may authorize its board of water commissioners to borrow money pending receipt of payments from the member towns as provided in this chapter by the issuance of its notes or orders payable not later than one year from the date. At the organizational meeting, the district shall further select a name for the district, determine compensation, if any, to be paid to its officers, determine the date on which its annual meeting shall be held, (which shall not be earlier than October 1 or later than December 31), and adopt a seal. A certified copy of the vote designating the name of the consolidated water district shall be forthwith filed by the clerk of the district with the Secretary of State.

       All district officers elected at an annual meeting and water commissioners elected by their constituent towns shall enter upon their duties on April 1 following their election, unless a different date is set at an annual meeting. A vacancy occurring in any district office other than commissioner caused by death, resignation, removal from the district, or incapacity of an officer to carry his or her duties, shall be temporarily filled by the board of water commissioners with a person from the municipality from which the vacancy occurs within 10 days after the vacancy occurs and until the date when the newly elected officers take office. The vacancy shall be filled at the next annual meeting of the district. The term of office of the water commissioners and the auditors shall be three years and all other officers one year. At the first annual meeting, the terms of office of the commissioners shall be divided by agreement. If possible by lot, if not, with one-third expiring after one year, and one-third expiring after two years, or as nearly as may be. At said first annual meeting, one auditor shall be elected for one year, and one auditor for two years, and thereafter for three years or until their successors are chosen and qualified.

      When the public good and necessity require water mains, drains, sewers, or sewer outlets to be laid out so as to extend into a town outside the limits of a city or village, or when the public good and necessity require that water mains, drains, sewers, or sewer outlets so laid out, be altered or discontinued, the city, by its council, or the village, by its trustees, if the parties interested cannot agree as to the question of public necessity or damages, may apply by petition to the Superior Court of the county where the highways or lands lie that will be occupied or affected by such laying out, alteration, or discontinuance, for the appointment of commissioners to inquire into the necessity of such laying out, alteration, or discontinuance, and of taking or occupying highways or other lands, and as to the damages that will be sustained thereby.

      At the time and place appointed for the hearing, the court shall hear all persons interested and wishing to be heard.
    If any person owning or having an interest in land to be taken or affected appears and objects to the necessity of taking the land included within the survey or any part thereof, then the court shall require the board to proceed with the introduction of evidence of the necessity of such taking.
    The burden of proof of the necessity of the taking shall be upon the board. The court may cite in additional parties including other property owners whose interests may be concerned or affected by any taking of land or interest therein based on any ultimate order of the court.
    The court shall make findings of fact and file them.
    The court shall, by its order, determine whether necessity requires the taking of such land and rights and may modify or alter the proposed taking in such respects as to it may seem proper.

      When an owner of land or rights therein and the board are unable to agree on the amount of compensation therefor or in case the owner is an infant, a person who lacks capacity to protect his or her interests due to a mental condition or psychiatric disability, absent from the State, unknown, or the owner of a contingent or uncertain interest, a Superior judge may, on the application of either party, cause the notice to be given of the application as he or she may prescribe, and after proof thereof, may appoint three disinterested persons to examine the property to be taken, or damaged by the municipal corporation. After being duly sworn, the commissioners shall, upon due notice to all parties in interest, view the premises, hear the parties in respect to the property, and shall assess and award to the owners and persons so interested just damages for any injury sustained and make report in writing to the judge. In determining damages resulting from the taking or use of property under the provisions of this chapter, the added value, if any, to the remaining property or right therein that inures directly to the owner thereof as a result of the taking or use as distinguished from the general public benefit, shall be considered. The judge may thereupon accept the report, unless just cause is shown to the contrary, and order the municipal corporation to pay the same in the time and manner as the judge may prescribe, in full compensation for the property taken, or the injury done by the municipal corporation, or the judge may reject or recommit the report if the ends of justice so require. On compliance with the order, the municipal corporation may proceed with the construction of its work without liability for further claim for damages. In his or her discretion, the judge may award costs in the proceeding. Appeals from the order may be taken to the Supreme Court under 12 V.S.A. chapter 102.

        Given the findings that a village was close to its maximum wastewater capacity, and that the rate structure was applied in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner, charging a developer the same rate for used and reserved wastewater capacity was not inequitable. Furthermore, the developer's "use" of the capacity in the form of holding it in reserve drove the village's costs and need for expansion just as if the developer was actually using the wastewater disposal system.

      Such sewage disposal commissioners shall have the supervision of such municipal sewage disposal department, and shall make and establish all needful rates for charges, rules, and regulations for its control and operation including the right to require any individual, person, or corporation to connect to such municipal system for the purposes of abating pollution of the waters of the State. Such commissioners may appoint or remove a superintendent at their pleasure. The charges and receipts of such department shall only be used and applied to pay the interest and principal of the sewage disposal bonds of such municipal corporation as well as the expense of maintenance and operation of the sewage disposal department or other expenses of the sewage system. These charges and receipts also may be used to develop a dedicated fund that may be created by the commissioners to finance major rehabilitation, major maintenance, and upgrade costs for the sewer system. This fund may be established by an annual set-aside of up to 15 percent of the normal operations, maintenance, and bond payment costs, except that with respect to subsurface leachfield systems, the annual set-aside may equal up to 100 percent of these costs. The fund shall not exceed the estimated future major rehabilitation, major maintenance, or upgrade costs for the sewer system. Any dedicated fund shall be insured at least to the level provided by FDIC and withdrawals shall be made only for the purposes for which the fund was established. Any such dedicated fund may be established and controlled in accord with section 2804 of this title or may be established by act of the legislative body of the municipality. Funds so established meet the requirements of subdivision 4756(a)(4) of this title. Where the municipal legislative body establishes such a fund, it shall first adopt a municipal ordinance authorizing and controlling such funds. Such ordinance and any local policies governing the funds must conform to the requirements of this section.

        Town could properly set standards in sewage ordinance to prevent future pollution, even though no more than the potential for pollution was presently evident. Shepard v. Town of Castleton, 152 Vt. 587, 568 A.2d 383 (1989).

         2. Effect of noncompliance.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Consequence of failing to follow mandate of subsection (b) of this section in adopting municipal ordinance relating to sewage systems is that the ordinance provision "shall not take effect until it is approved by the department of environmental conservation." Richards v. Nowicki, 172 Vt. 142, 772 A.2d 510 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Effect of failure of town to obtain approval of department of environmental conservation of amendments to its septic ordinance was to leave the original ordinance in force, unamended. Richards v. Nowicki, 172 Vt. 142, 772 A.2d 510 (2001).

         3. Grandfather clause.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Because subsection (d) of this section explicitly grandfathered older, noncomplying standards, indicating no preference between the older and newer standards, if the result of noncompliance with mandate of subsection (b) is that grandfathered standards are left in place, that result is fully consistent with legislative intent. Richards v. Nowicki, 172 Vt. 142, 772 A.2d 510 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Paragraph of town's septic ordinance stating in part that, "[i]n case of a conflict between their requirements and any other regulation, ordinance or statute applicable in [town], the more stringent shall apply" did not require selectmen to use more stringent state minimum standards, rather than those contained in the ordinance itself, because, by virtue of subsection (d) of this section, explicitly making pre-existing ordinance the applicable standard, there were no applicable state standards different from those stated in the ordinance. Richards v. Nowicki, 172 Vt. 142, 772 A.2d 510 (2001).

      When a demand is made upon the district for the payment of an execution issued against it and the district has no available funds to pay the same, the board of sewer commissioners shall compute the share of each member town in such execution, with costs, interest, and other charges, to be paid by it in accordance with the agreement among the member towns or the formula established in section 3679 of this title, and shall give notice of the amount thereof to the legislative branch of each member town.
    The member town through its proper officer shall forthwith pay to the treasurer of the district its share of the execution and any charges.
    If the member town has insufficient funds to pay its share, its legislative branch shall forthwith assess and have collected a tax sufficient to pay the same in the manner its other taxes are assessed and collected.

        In a spite-fence case, the trial court did not apply the livestock-fencing statute or require plaintiffs to build a partition fence; rather, it merely used the livestock-fencing statute as a reference point for determining a reasonable height for a fence serving the legitimate purpose of marking the boundary. It was not improper for the trial court to consider the livestock-fencing statute, together with all other relevant factors, in determining the height of a reasonable fence under the circumstances.

        Where this section provides that a property owner may petition the town selectmen for an administrative exemption from participating in the maintenance of a division fence, the possibility that the selectmen would act unreasonably, exceed their powers or ignore their duties under color of this section could not be considered by the supreme court in passing on the constitutionality of this section.

        Under this section one is not guilty of contributory negligence in turning his cattle into his pasture although he has knowledge that division fence of adjoining landowner is insufficient, and that if his cattle should escape into the owner's field they would be liable to injury; and in action to recover for injuries to plaintiff's cattle, evidence is not admissible on behalf of defendant to prove knowledge of the insufficient fence.

        Where defendant's bull escaped into plaintiff's adjoining pasture and injured his horse, plaintiff's fence being insufficient and out of repair, and bull escaping through a gap in the portion that plaintiff was bound to maintain, bull was in plaintiff's field through his own neglect to build legal division fence and defendant was not liable.

        Where fences were divided pursuant to statute and, through defendant's failure to maintain his portion, plaintiff's horses escaped through that portion upon defendant's land, where they were gored by his bull, the fact that plaintiff's portion of fence was defective and insufficient did not bar his recovery of damages for this injury to his horses, if in fact horses escaped through defendant's portion of fence.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Fence viewers have no official authority to establish disputed boundary line and their establishment of one is merely award on oral submission or parol contract. Camp v. Camp, 59 Vt. 667, 10 A. 748 (1887).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fence viewers have no authority to settle rights of different claimants of land, or to establish disputed boundaries; and neither party is precluded by their decision from contesting question of ownership in himself, or in adverse party, or location of their boundaries. Shaw v. Gilfillan, 22 Vt. 565 (1850).

       <p>
        In action of trespass on freehold for building fence on plaintiff's land, evidence was not admissible in favor of defendant as bearing on question of location of division line, to show that fence viewers established line, and that defendant then built his share of fence at plaintiff's request; or to prove license, as exceptions do not show that defendant claimed one; but it was admissible as bearing on the question of exemplary damages.

      When called upon to act, the fence viewers shall give notice to parties interested, or to their tenants or agents, of the time when they will examine the fence or line between adjoining lands, before they make a division relating to the same.
    When fence viewers make a division of fence, or appraise the value of a fence made or repaired, or examine as to the sufficiency of a fence, they shall certify the same. When they make a division of fence and so certify, a record of the same in the office of the clerk of the town in which the line is situated shall be valid against the parties, their heirs, and assigns.

        Adjoining land owners may make a parol agreement as to division fence that is binding on themselves until repudiated; and it can be proved by oral testimony. Blood v. Spaulding, 57 Vt. 422 (1885); Scott v. Grover, 56 Vt. 499 (1884).
       </p>
       <p>
        If contiguous land owners by parol agreement divide fence between them, the agreement is binding so long as they act under it; and if one fails to make his part legal fence and other's cattle escape over it into his field, he has no right to impound them. Hitchcock v. Tower, 55 Vt. 60 (1883).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In a spite-fence case, the trial court did not apply the livestock-fencing statute or require plaintiffs to build a partition fence; rather, it merely used the livestock-fencing statute as a reference point for determining a reasonable height for a fence serving the legitimate purpose of marking the boundary. It was not improper for the trial court to consider the livestock-fencing statute, together with all other relevant factors, in determining the height of a reasonable fence under the circumstances. Obolensky v. Trombley, 198 Vt. 401, 115 A.3d 1016 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the parties in their settlement agreement clearly contemplated the possibility of a fence, their agreement did not specify the dimensions, characteristics, or location of any fence, and could not be construed as an agreement to any fence of any character and dimension at any location, essentially waiving the protections of the spite-fence statute. The trial court did not rule that any fence would violate the spite-fence statute; it ruled that the fence here was a spite fence as erected. Obolensky v. Trombley, 198 Vt. 401, 115 A.3d 1016 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that a structure complies with zoning or permitting ordinances does not preclude a finding that the structure violates a spite-fence statute. Thus, the fact that plaintiffs' fence did not require a town permit did not undermine the conclusion that it violated the statute. Obolensky v. Trombley, 198 Vt. 401, 115 A.3d 1016 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence supported the trial court's findings and conclusions that plaintiffs' fence was a "spite fence." The trial court properly considered the history of intense animosity and conflict between the parties, the credibility of plaintiffs' claimed reasons for building the fence, and the usefulness or uselessness of the fence for purposes of privacy, security, and quiet enjoyment; furthermore, the trial court did not ignore the legitimate purposes of the fence identified by plaintiffs. Obolensky v. Trombley, 198 Vt. 401, 115 A.3d 1016 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a dispute over a fence, it appeared from the record that the trial court relied on a site visit only to assist in its evaluation of the testimony and other evidence. Such use of the site visit was entirely proper. Alberino v. Balch, 185 Vt. 589, 969 A.2d 61 (mem.) (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Factual backdrop in a dispute over a fence - photographs of the fence, a site visit, a contempt order concerning an earlier fence in virtually the same location, and over 15 years of increasingly acrid disputes between the parties about dogs, brush piles, trespass, plowing, and noise - supported a finding that the fence was intended solely to annoy appellee by obstructing his view and shading his property. Thus, whether the fence was erected solely to annoy appellee or primarily to annoy him was immaterial to the outcome of the appeal. Alberino v. Balch, 185 Vt. 589, 969 A.2d 61 (mem.) (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a dispute over a fence erected by appellant, the trial court's finding that the fence was not flush with the ground and thus was useless to prevent appellant's dogs from crossing the property line was supported by photographs that plainly showed gaps in the lower part of the fence, resulting from warping panels and from appellant's failure to align the bottoms of the panels with the varied terrain. Moreover, appellee testified that the irregular plywood boards were warping and "cupping" as much as two feet in places, and it was undisputed that the fence did not actually prevent dogs from crossing the property line. Alberino v. Balch, 185 Vt. 589, 969 A.2d 61 (mem.) (2008).

         2. Test for intent.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Dominant-purpose test and the sole-purpose test for determining whether the intent element of a spite-fence statute is satisfied are not far apart in practical terms. Under the dominant-purpose test adopted by the Court, a plaintiff still must show that the fence would strike an ordinary beholder as manifestly erected with a leading purpose to annoy the adjoining owner or occupant in his use of his premises. This manifest, positive, and leading feature of the fence must be so predominating as a motive as to give character to the structure, with any real usefulness of the structure being manifestly subordinate and incidental. Obolensky v. Trombley, 198 Vt. 401, 115 A.3d 1016 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont Supreme Court joins its sister courts of New England in adopting the dominant-purpose test for determining whether the intent element of a spite-fence statute is satisfied. The very nature of a fence is such that privacy could always be given as the reason for erecting it, even when the evidence shows egregious, malicious intent which plainly outweighs any benefit gained by the erector of the fence. Obolensky v. Trombley, 198 Vt. 401, 115 A.3d 1016 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        For a fence to be considered a "spite fence" within the meaning of the statute, the plaintiff must show that in the absence of intent to annoy, the fence would not have been built or maintained. This rule most carefully balances the competing concerns of protection of property rights and the discouragement of pointless inflictions of harm among neighbors. Obolensky v. Trombley, 198 Vt. 401, 115 A.3d 1016 (2015).

       That there exists in the State unsanitary or unsafe dwelling accommodations and that persons of low income are forced to reside in such unsanitary or unsafe accommodations; that within the State there is a shortage of safe or sanitary dwelling accommodations available at rents that persons of low income can afford and that such persons are forced to occupy overcrowded and congested dwelling accommodations; that the aforesaid conditions cause an increase in and spread of disease and crime and constitute a menace to the health, safety, morals, and welfare of the residents of the State of Vermont and impair economic value; that these conditions necessitate excessive and disproportionate expenditures of public funds for crime prevention and punishment, public health and safety, fire and accident protection, and other public services and facilities.
      </li>
      <li id="t24p02c113s4001ol12">
       That these slum areas cannot be cleared, nor can the shortage of safe and sanitary dwellings for persons of low income be relieved through the operation of private enterprise and that the construction of housing projects for persons of low income, as defined in section 4002 of this chapter, would therefore not be competitive with the private enterprise.

       That substandard and decadent areas exist in certain portions of the State of Vermont and that there is not, in certain parts of the State, an adequate supply of decent, safe, and sanitary housing for persons of low income or elders of low income, or both available for rents that the persons can afford to pay, and the rents that the persons can afford to pay would not warrant private enterprise in providing housing for the persons; that this situation tends to cause an increase and spread of communicable and chronic disease; that the lack of properly constructed dwelling units designed specifically to meet the needs of elders aggravate those diseases peculiar to elders, thereby crowding the hospitals of the State with elders under conditions of neglect that inevitably exacerbate mental deterioration; that this situation constitutes a menace to the health, safety, welfare, and comfort of the inhabitants of the State and is detrimental to property values in the localities in which it exists; that this situation cannot readily be remedied by the private enterprise and that a public exigency exists that makes the provision of housing for elders of low income and the clearance of substandard and decadent areas a public necessity; that the provision of housing for elders of low income for the purpose of reducing the cost to the State of their care by promoting their health and welfare, thereby prolonging their productivity in the interest of the State and nation and the clearance of substandard and decadent areas is declared to be a public use for which private property may be taken by eminent domain and public funds raised by taxation may be expended, and the necessity in the public interest for provisions hereinafter enacted, is hereby declared as a matter of legislative determination.

       <p>
        The mayor in conducting proceeding to remove chairman of housing authority was acting in a judicial capacity. Davis v. Cain, 127 Vt. 296, 248 A.2d 688 (1968).
       </p>

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where dismissal of chairman of housing authority was instigated by mayor, and it was at his discretion that city attorney formulated the charges and gave notice of hearing to petitioner, failure to indicate in letter of notice that it was sent at mayor's discretion and under his authority was not sufficient grounds for dismissal of action. Davis v. Cain, 127 Vt. 296, 248 A.2d 688 (1968).

         3. Grounds for removal.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Mayor's right to remove chairman of housing authority is dependent upon establishment of circumstances which, in law, amount to the authorized grounds for removal. Davis v. Cain, 127 Vt. 296, 248 A.2d 688 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mayor's power to remove chairman of housing authority did not spring from any supervisory relationship, but was an accompaniment to his power of appointment and exercise of that power could not be capricious or casual, but must be based on some verifiable breach of statutory duty that constituted, at law, the claimed inefficiency or neglect of duty. Davis v. Cain, 127 Vt. 296, 248 A.2d 688 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        In view of evidence of joint meetings between the housing authority commissioners and the board of aldermen, as well as communications with aldermanic liaison committee, claim of failure of chairman of housing authority to properly communicate with mayor did not amount to that inefficiency or neglect of duty which was of substance sufficient to support removal. Davis v. Cain, 127 Vt. 296, 248 A.2d 688 (1968).

         4. Burden of proof.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Burden was on mayor to bring forward any evidence of violation of duty by chairman of housing authority so that it might have been met as such by the chairman, and validly assigned weight in the findings. Davis v. Cain, 127 Vt. 296, 248 A.2d 688 (1968).

         5. Review.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Reviewing court had an undeniable right to examine the evidence to determine whether there was any legal evidence tending to establish a legal cause for removal of chairman of housing authority by mayor. Davis v. Cain, 127 Vt. 296, 248 A.2d 688 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        If there was evidence tending to establish legal cause for mayor's removal of chairman of housing authority, the weight of the evidence and the sufficiency of the cause are for the removing authority to determine, and its action in that particular would not be reviewed. Davis v. Cain, 127 Vt. 296, 248 A.2d 688 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the absence of specific provision for appeal from decision of mayor in dismissing chairman of Burlington Housing Authority, the resort to a petition for a writ of certiorari was a proper remedy. Davis v. Cain, 127 Vt. 296, 248 A.2d 688 (1968).

      It is hereby declared to be the policy of this State that each housing authority shall manage and operate its housing projects in an efficient manner so as to enable it to fix the rentals for dwelling accommodations at the lowest possible rates consistent with providing decent, safe, and sanitary dwelling accommodations and that no housing authority shall construct or operate any such project for profit, or as a source of revenue to the State or municipality.
    To this end an authority shall fix the rental for dwellings in its projects at no higher rate than it shall find to be necessary in order to produce revenue which, together with all other available moneys, revenues, income and receipts of the authority from whatever source derived, will be sufficient:

      In addition to the powers conferred upon an authority by other provisions of this chapter, an authority is empowered to borrow money or accept grants or other financial assistance from the federal government for, or in aid of, any housing project within its area of operation, to take over or lease or manage any housing project or undertaking constructed or owned by the federal government and to these ends to comply with such conditions and enter into such mortgages, trust indentures, leases, or agreements as may be necessary, convenient, or desirable.
    It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to authorize every authority to do any and all things necessary or desirable to secure the financial aid or the cooperation of the federal government in the undertaking, construction, maintenance, or operation of any housing project by such authority.

      1. Delegated authority.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     Vermont Planning and Development Act provides ample guidance to regional commissions regarding the development of regional plans in that the law identifies a legislative purpose for planning generally, it lists specific goals with which regional plans must be consistent, it identifies the duties of regional planning commissions and required elements for regional plans, and it provides procedural requirements for adopting plans, including the opportunity for public hearing and comment. Given this extensive statutory scheme, requiring regional commissions to define a substantial regional impact as part of developing a regional plan does not constitute an unlawful delegation. In re B&M Realty, LLC, 203 Vt. 438, 158 A.3d 754 (2016).
    </p>
    <p>
     The power of a municipality to accomplish zoning exists by virtue of authority delegated from the State, and may be exercised only in accordance with that delegation, subject to any terms and conditions imposed by the State. State v. Sanguinetti, 141 Vt. 349, 449 A.2d 922 (1982).

        Because a landowner's claim that new zoning regulations violated the chapter governing municipal and regional planning and development was a statutory claim - not a constitutional claim - it belonged in the Environmental Division. Gould v. Town of Monkton, 202 Vt. 535, 150 A.3d 1084 (2016).

       <p>
        Through its 2009 reorganization of the Superior Court, the Legislature not only divested the Civil Division of exclusive jurisdiction over matters arising under the chapter governing municipal and regional planning and development but also granted exclusive jurisdiction to the Environmental Division. When viewed together, the plain language of the statutes governing the jurisdiction of the Civil and Environmental Divisions make this clear. Gould v. Town of Monkton, 202 Vt. 535, 150 A.3d 1084 (2016).

       General purposes.
    
    It is the intent and purpose of this chapter to encourage the appropriate development of all lands in this State by the action of its constituent municipalities and regions, with the aid and assistance of the State, in a manner which will promote the public health, safety against fire, floods, explosions, and other dangers; to promote prosperity, comfort, access to adequate light and air, convenience, efficiency, economy, and general welfare; to enable the mitigation of the burden of property taxes on agricultural, forest, and other open lands; to encourage appropriate architectural design; to encourage the development of renewable resources; to protect residential, agricultural, and other areas from undue concentrations of population and overcrowding of land and buildings, from traffic congestion, from inadequate parking and the invasion of through traffic, and from the loss of peace, quiet, and privacy; to facilitate the growth of villages, towns, and cities and of their communities and neighborhoods so as to create an optimum environment, with good civic design; to encourage development of a rich cultural environment and to foster the arts; and to provide means and methods for the municipalities and regions of this State to plan for the prevention, minimization, and future elimination of such land development problems as may presently exist or which may be foreseen and to implement those plans when and where appropriate. In implementing any regulatory power under this chapter, municipalities shall take care to protect the constitutional right of the people to acquire, possess, and protect property.

      <li id="t24p02c117sub01s4302ol1b">
       It is also the intent of the Legislature that municipalities, regional planning commissions, and State agencies shall engage in a continuing planning process that will further the following goals:

         To encourage citizen participation at all levels of the planning process, and to assure that decisions shall be made at the most local level possible commensurate with their impact.

        <li id="t24p02c117sub01s4302ol1b3">
         To consider the use of resources and the consequences of growth and development for the region and the State, as well as the community in which it takes place.

        Certain recreational uses of private property plainly fall outside the rudiments of zoning, the primary purpose of which is to manage municipal and regional growth and development in an organized fashion, not to regulate the incidental recreational activities of private property owners.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Exercise of police power to institute zoning is constitutional without compensating the affected properties for loss of value, conditioned on there remaining in the owner some practical use of his land and conditioned on existence of a public good or benefit of sufficient magnitude to justify the burdening of the affected property.

         3. Validity of ordinances.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        It is the clear intent of the Legislature that zoning ordinances may be intended in whole or in part to protect aesthetics, and no greater level of support in a town plan is required for ordinances based on aesthetic considerations than for other ordinances. Town of Sandgate v. Colehamer, 156 Vt. 77, 589 A.2d 1205 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        When validity of zoning ordinance is questioned, key constitutional concern is that the zoning authority is exercised in a manner consistent with the proper limits of the police power, and that power requires reference to the public health, safety, morals, or general welfare. Galanes v. Town of Brattleboro, 136 Vt. 235, 388 A.2d 406 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Zoning law being in derogation of private property rights, municipalities must strictly comply with the statutory mandates, but zoning enactments are entitled to presumption of validity. Galanes v. Town of Brattleboro, 136 Vt. 235, 388 A.2d 406 (1978).

         4. Spot zoning.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In zoning law, spot zoning, which is usually condemned, is the singling out of a small parcel or a single lot and zoning it for a use classification different from the surrounding area and inconsistent with any comprehensive plan, or zoning it to avoid a use permitted by existing law. Galanes v. Town of Brattleboro, 136 Vt. 235, 388 A.2d 406 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where strip of land 200 feet deep on each side of avenue for 1,000 feet was rezoned from "Roadside Commercial" to "Neighborhood Business," thereby greatly reducing the types of commercial enterprises which could be carried on, and disallowing gas station which plaintiffs wanted to build and could have built under the "Roadside Commercial" designation, there was no confiscation of plaintiffs' property without due process, or denial of equal protection, and lower court improperly found rezoning unreasonable and void as applied to plaintiffs' land on the ground that it was reverse spot zoning for the private benefit of the present enterprises in the area and an attempt to prevent expansion of nonresidential use and limit commercial use which was contrary to the public good. Galanes v. Town of Brattleboro, 136 Vt. 235, 388 A.2d 406 (1978).

        Ordinance provision requiring subdivision approval for construction of a road serving more than two lots was valid because the use of undeveloped land to site the new road is clearly "land development" as defined by this section, the issue of siting of a road is a traditional central concern of subdivision regulation, and the ordinance allows subdivision jurisdiction only if the newly constructed or extended road serves more than two lots.

        The act of subdividing land is a form of "land development" and brings the landowner under the authority of the zoning ordinance, whose purpose is to regulate and determine land development. Drumheller v. Shelburne Zoning Board of Adjustment, 155 Vt. 524, 586 A.2d 1150 (1990).

        In prosecution of property owner under city zoning ordinance for having a sign projecting over a public right-of-way, the city bylaw requiring him to remove his nonconforming sign was found in conflict with section 4408 of this title, governing nonconforming uses and structures at the time the bylaw was enacted in 1973, and was invalid, being beyond the scope of authority delegated to city, where subsection (11) of this section defined a sign as a structure and section 4408 provided that a noncomplying structure could continue in perpetuity, whereas the bylaw in question required that all nonconforming signs be removed within five years of November 6, 1973.

        Statute governing municipal planning commissions did not require that commissioners only be removed for cause but, by its terms, provided municipal legislature with authority to remove commissioners at will, qualified only by requirement that decision to remove be made by unanimous vote; moreover, there was no indication that Legislature intended to insulate planning commission members from removal by appointing authority.

       </p>
       <p>
        Nothing in statute governing municipal planning commissions granted commissioners a right or entitlement to their positions; on the contrary, statute stated that planning commissioners could be removed "at any time," and former commissioners' unilateral expectation that they would serve out their entire terms, without more, did not rise to a protectable property interest sufficient to implicate procedural due process.

       <p>
        Because the Northwest Regional Planning Commission (NWRPC) performs so few "governmental functions," it is constitutionally permissible for the state to provide for appointment of NWRPC commissioners without violating the "one person, one vote" doctrine of the Equal Protection Clause.

         2. Delegated authority.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Regional commission's definition of "substantial regional impact" is not binding on the court; rather, it is entitled to due consideration in state regulatory proceedings. Because the court retains ultimate discretion to determine a substantial regional impact with reference to the statutory framework and goals, subject to due consideration of a regional commission's own definition, the Legislature has not made a wholesale delegation of legislative authority to the regional commissions.

       <p>
        Because of its purpose and effect, the statutory provision stating that "upon the expiration of a plan, all bylaws and capital budgets and programs then in effect shall remain in effect, but shall not be amended until a plan is in effect" embodies a substantive - not procedural - requirement, and the statute of limitations for challenging purported procedural defects therefore does not apply to challenges premised on the provision. Therefore, a town was not time-barred from challenging the validity of an ordinance under the provision. In re Paynter 2-Lot Subdivision, 187 Vt. 637, 996 A.2d 219 (mem.) (2010).

       <p>
        Enumeration of powers granted to municipalities with respect to zoning regulation does not rely on identity of the owner, but on the use of property. In re Sardi, 170 Vt. 623, 751 A.2d 772 (mem.) (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Construction of zoning ordinance as permitting regulation of property based on identity of owner rather than use of land is inconsistent with Legislature's grant of authority to adopt zoning regulations. Vermont Baptist Convention v. Burlington Zoning Board, 159 Vt. 28, 613 A.2d 710 (1992).

       <p>
        Municipality has zoning authority only in accordance with and subject to terms and conditions imposed by the State in making the power grant. National Advertising Co. v. Cooley, 126 Vt. 263, 227 A.2d 406 (1967), (Decided under prior law.)

       <p>
        Developer did not have a vested right to develop its subdivided lots under version of zoning ordinance in effect when its subdivision permit was issued; rather, developer was subject to provisions of interim zoning amendment in effect when it applied for zoning permit eleven years later. In re Taft Corners Associates, Inc., 171 Vt. 135, 758 A.2d 804 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        A landowner acquires no vested rights to develop prior to the enactment of a zoning ordinance other than those expressly granted by statutes. In re McCormick Management Co., 149 Vt. 585, 547 A.2d 1319 (1988).

       <p>
        Zoning regulations must reflect the town plan, but need not be controlled by it, and though the plan may recommend many desirable approaches to development, only those provisions incorporated in the bylaws are legally enforceable.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Ordinance provision requiring subdivision approval for construction of a road serving more than two lots was valid because the use of undeveloped land to site the new road is clearly "land development" as defined by statute, the issue of siting of a road is a traditional central concern of subdivision regulation, and the ordinance allows subdivision jurisdiction only if the newly constructed or extended road serves more than two lots. In re Shantee Point, Inc., 174 Vt. 248, 811 A.2d 1243 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Zoning distinction based upon identity of owner rather than public health, safety, morals, or general welfare would be invalid. Vermont Baptist Convention v. Burlington Zoning Board, 159 Vt. 28, 613 A.2d 710 (1992).

       <p>
        There is no statutory prohibition of incorporation by reference in Vermont; neither this section, authorizing adoption of bylaws, nor section 4403 of this title, which provides for filing "a copy of the proposed by-law, amendment or repeal for public review," prohibits such incorporation, nor do the sections require all of the provisions of the bylaw to be contained within the four corners of the document, although that would be the better practice.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Given town's right under this section to control the density of population and intensity of land use, adoption of proposal to control growth rate by limiting the issuance of building permits would be valid in principle and could only be challenged on constitutional grounds, and the limitation would be constitutional if there was a showing of a substantial relationship between the limitation and the public health, welfare, and safety. 1972-74 Op.

         10. Aesthetics.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        It is the clear intent of the Legislature that zoning ordinances may be intended in whole or in part to protect aesthetics, and no greater level of support in a town plan is required for ordinances based on aesthetic considerations than for other ordinances.

       <p>
        Zoning ordinance prohibiting the storage of junk cars on property if unscreened from view was adequately supported by town plan whose stated goals were to "limit development, maintain open space, and achieve the best possible quality of environment" and which strongly encouraged the "conservation and proper management of open land."

        The fact that this section provides for different voting requirements between urban and rural areas does not violate the Equal Protection Clause; since the Legislature could find that higher populations introduce new and different zoning and planning problems that warrant differences in the governmental response, the distinction is not arbitrary.

       <p>
        Ordinarily, if a zoning ordinance or amendment as finally adopted contains alterations substantially different (amounting to a new proposal) from those originally advertised and heard, there must be additional notice and opportunity for additional hearing; however, no further notice or hearing is required after a properly advertised and properly conducted public hearing when the alteration of the initial proposal is insubstantial. Kalakowski v. Town of Clarendon, 139 Vt. 519, 431 A.2d 478 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Proposed amendments of zoning bylaws, which were substantially modified after the initial public hearing thereon and which were subsequently approved by vote of the electors at a special town meeting, were invalid for lack of the statutorily required public hearing on changes in zoning bylaws. Kalakowski v. Town of Clarendon, 139 Vt. 519, 431 A.2d 478 (1981).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        A special town meeting does not satisfy the statutory requirement for a public hearing upon proposed changes in zoning bylaws, since the purpose of the hearing upon changes in zoning bylaws is to inform the selectmen of public sentiment so that they may alter and shape the proposals to conform to the public interest, while a special town meeting is directed towards allowing a time for citizens to debate all town business before a vote is taken, thus assuring an informed vote. Kalakowski v. Town of Clarendon, 139 Vt. 519, 431 A.2d 478 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        The first day of an annual or special town meeting cannot serve as a statutorily required public hearing upon proposed changes in zoning bylaws for votes taken the next day, for not only is there insufficient time for the selectmen to restructure proposals, but a meeting adjourned one day until the next is generally considered to be one meeting. Kalakowski v. Town of Clarendon, 139 Vt. 519, 431 A.2d 478 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Warning for special town meeting to discuss proposed amendments to zoning bylaws which were identical to or substantially similar to changes approved by vote of the electors at an earlier town meeting, the results of which were subsequently declared invalid because of procedural irregularities in a judicial proceeding, was not violative of the statutory notice requirements because it did not instead call for reconsideration or rescission of the vote at the earlier meeting, since the earlier vote, because not taken in accordance with the prescribed statutory procedures, was void ab initio and, therefore, there was nothing to re-evaluate. Kalakowski v. Town of Clarendon, 139 Vt. 519, 431 A.2d 478 (1981).

        .
       </h5>
       <p>
        A city has broad discretion within the statutory language to determine how it will treat modifications of preexisting noncomplying structures, and the provision of the zoning ordinance governing development of noncomplying structures on preexisting small lots falls within that discretion. In re Appeal of Wesco, Inc., 180 Vt. 520, 904 A.2d 1145 (mem.) (June 12, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        City failed in its argument that subdivision (1) of this section protects only permitted uses on undersized lots and not conditional uses on such lots. The term "permitted use" can be used to distinguish the use from a conditional use. The terms are distinguished generally by the regulatory requirements that must be met to obtain a zoning permit. Thus, once conditional use permit requirements are met, the use "complies with all applicable zoning regulations" and is indistinguishable from a permitted use. In re Appeal of Wesco, Inc., 180 Vt. 520, 904 A.2d 1145 (mem.) (June 12, 2006).
       </p>

        Supreme Court of Vermont cannot consider a public highway to be a use incidental to the primary use on an abutting property. Nor can it be considered open space. In re Bailey, 178 Vt. 614 (mem.), 883 A.2d 765 (July 26, 2005).

       <p>
        Practical inability to develop land does not require its exclusion from a "lot"' within the meaning of the statute dealing with preexisting small lots; for example, land under a brook, although not easily developed, is included in the minimum lot size requirement for purposes of the statute. In contrast, land under a road is already developed and for a use incompatible with other uses by the owner, and the Supreme Court of Vermont cannot conclude that it should be included in the owner's lot for determining compliance with the statute. In re Bailey, 178 Vt. 614 (mem.), 883 A.2d 765 (July 26, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Area under a strip of land used as a highway could not be included in the lot size calculation; thus, the lot was not a preexisting undersized lot. In re Bailey, 178 Vt. 614 (mem.), 883 A.2d 765 (July 26, 2005).

        A zoning board of adjustment (ZBA) considering a conditional use application normally will be determined to have acted within the statutory time period so long as the decision is finally made before the expiration of the 60-day period, regardless of when, or if, the decision is reduced to writing or made in writing. Accordingly, a permit was timely approved by a ZBA decision issued seventy-nine days after closure of the public hearing; it was not "deemed approved" under the statute.

        Court erred in considering the historic origins of building, character and authenticity of proposed alterations, and functional utility of defendant's proposed renovations to building design control district because Village of Woodstock Zoning Ordinance does not set out any such criteria. Village of Woodstock v. Bahramian, 160 Vt. 417, 631 A.2d 1129 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant appealed planning commissions' denial of four proposed alterations to building in design control district, and Village of Woodstock did not cross-appeal, court erred in concluding that entire application was before it on appeal, including alterations that were approved by commission; court's review was limited to the four items raised in notice of appeal.

       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court's use of a material-adverse-effect standard to review proposed conditional uses under subdivision (2) of this section facilitates a rational result consistent with legislative intent, as any conditional use will have some adverse effect, and the Legislature clearly intended to allow municipalities to grant conditional use permits. In re Walker, 156 Vt. 639, 588 A.2d 1059 (1991).

       <p>
        At proceedings pursuant to application for conditional use permit to operate gravel pit, the conclusion of the trial court that operation of the pit would not adversely affect traffic on roads and highways in the vicinity was inconsistent with its findings as to conditions of relevant roads and safe driving speeds of loaded gravel trucks, and therefore remand was required for consideration of conditions upon issuance of the permit that would take into account the trial court's findings.

        At trial de novo on appeal from denial of conditional use permit by applicant seeking to construct a retail farm stand to be connected to an existing house, the trial court's conclusions that proposed stand was a commercial, not an accessory use, and that agriculture was a second principal use of the property which the lot could not adequately support were not clearly erroneous, arbitrary, or capricious and would stand.

        Superior Court had jurisdiction over appeal from zoning board of adjustment's denial of conditional use permit, notwithstanding that appeal was prematurely filed upon rendering of oral decision not constituting a "final decision"; appeal would be treated as if it had been filed on day of entry of judgment, upon expiration of statutory period within which board was required to issue final written decision.

        Landowners failed in their argument that the trial court erred by construing town's zoning ordinance to permit a solid waste transfer station that was functioning as a pre-existing nonconforming use to construct an access road connecting the station to a highway because the zoning ordinance expressly allows extensions and expansions of nonconforming uses that are approved by the zoning board of appeals pursuant to identified criteria.

        There was no merit to landowner's argument that neither town zoning ordinance nor its enabling legislation prohibited expansion of a noncomplying structure in a setback area; repeal of statutory provision merely brought noncomplying structures and nonconforming uses under same regulatory regime, and ordinance's interchangeable use of terms "noncomplying structure" and "nonconforming structure" was only a clerical error.

        The extension of a nonconforming use involves the exercise of powers distinguishable from, and more limited than, the exercise of the power to grant variances. DeWitt v. Town of Brattleboro Zoning Board of Adjustment, 128 Vt. 313, 262 A.2d 472 (1970).

        That filling station which constituted a nonconforming use was outdated was insufficient to support claim of unnecessary hardship for which an enlargement and extension to build a new, larger and more modern structure could be granted. DeWitt v. Town of Brattleboro Zoning Board of Adjustment, 128 Vt. 313, 262 A.2d 472 (1970).

       <p>
        Town zoning board of adjustment did not have power to amend zoning ordinances and could not do so under the guise of granting outdated filling station an extension and enlargement of its nonconforming use in order to build a larger, modern structure.

        Since it is the general policy of zoning to carefully limit the extension of a nonconforming use, the enlargement of a nonconforming use by new construction is treated as a variance, rather than an exception to the regulations.

         9. Resumption.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        City failed in its argument that, under subdivision (b)(3) of this section, its zoning provision was invalid because it allowed restoration of a nonconforming use for twelve months after discontinuance, rather than six months. The statute has been construed as a floor that restricts municipality from adopting a policy less favorable to the landowner, but allows a more favorable policy. Thus, a municipality is free to establish a longer discontinuance period before landowner lose the right to resume a nonconforming use. In re Appeal of Wesco, Inc., 180 Vt. 520, 904 A.2d 1145 (mem.) (June 12, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        A town ordinance's discontinuance provision regarding nonconforming uses applied to require a property owner to obtain a conditional use permit for a children's camp without consideration of any former use that was discontinued over twenty years ago. In re Lashins, 174 Vt. 467, 807 A.2d 420 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Town zoning ordinance did not require intent to abandon a nonconforming use before right to maintain that use was lost; pursuant to statute, town chose a policy of prohibiting resumptions of nonconforming uses based on discontinuance, rather than abandonment, and therefore ordinance could not be held to extinguish a nonconforming use only if there was abandonment, and both statute and ordinance provided that "intent to resume" a nonconforming use did not confer the right to resume. Badger v. Town of Ferrisburgh, 168 Vt. 37, 712 A.2d 911 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although subsection (c) of this section allows a preexisting noncomplying structure to remain in place in perpetuity, once a nonconforming use of that structure is abandoned or discontinued, subdivision (b)(3) contemplates that a municipality may prohibit resumption of such use.

       </h5>
       <p>
        In prosecution of property owner under city zoning ordinance for having a sign projecting over a public right-of-way, the city bylaw requiring him to remove his nonconforming sign was found in conflict with this section, governing nonconforming uses and structures, at the time the bylaw was enacted in 1973, and was invalid, being beyond the scope of authority delegated to city, where section 4303(11) of this title defined a sign as a structure and this section provided that a noncomplying structure could continue in perpetuity, whereas the bylaw in question required that all nonconforming signs be removed within five years of November 6, 1973. State v. Sanguinetti, 141 Vt. 349, 449 A.2d 922 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        City zoning bylaw passed in 1973 which required that all nonconforming signs be removed within five years of November 6, 1973, was invalid under former subsection (c) of this section at the time the bylaw was enacted, and neither the repeal of subsection (c) in 1980 nor the general savings clause in the city charter had any effect on the bylaw's invalidity at the time of its adoption.

         12. Noncomplying structure.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Ruling of Environmental Court which restricted residential use of barn to part of barn behind forty-foot setback was clearly erroneous, since nothing in statute or municipal zoning regulation directed such a result and allowing applicants to use only part of barn was impractical; moreover, there was no case law that limited a permitted activity to the complying part of a noncomplying structure. In re Miserocchi, 170 Vt. 320, 749 A.2d 607 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Issue involved a noncomplying structure, and not a nonconforming use, because the nonconformity was caused by a violation of setback requirements and not a land use impermissible in the zone involved. In re Stowe Club Highlands, 164 Vt. 272, 668 A.2d 1271 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Zoning ordinance did not authorize developer to totally replace a noncomplying structure, a barn, lying within setback area because section of ordinance containing the only language specifically authorizing reconstruction applied to nonconforming uses, but barn was not nonconforming use and court would infer that drafters of ordinance intended to prohibit reconstruction in any other circumstance.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Municipal power to regulate the location of public facilities (granted to Vermont municipalities by State statute) is not unlimited; for example, the municipality cannot condition grant of landscaping permit on the submission by a public agency to the municipality's authority to regulate the location of a facility unless reasonable provision has been made in the municipal bylaws concerning such location requirements. State Buildings Div. v. Town of Castleton Board of Adjustment, 138 Vt. 250, 415 A.2d 188 (1980).

        Statutory grant of authority to municipalities to zone, clearly indicating purpose to measure the reach of municipal authority, and not specifically allowing zoning with respect to sewers for State owned and operated institutions, barred town from extending its zoning authority over residential treatment facility operated by the State, and town could not condition grant of landscaping permit on the procuring, by the State, of a sewer construction permit.

        Nothing in the Woodstock zoning ordinance requires a landowner to show compliance with the Vermont Common Interest Ownership Act in order to obtain a zoning permit; moreover, it is doubtful that a municipality could adopt such a requirement. The Vermont Common Interest Ownership Act has its own private remedies, and there is no suggestion that public, regulatory remedies were intended. In re Woodstock Community Trust & Housing Vt.

A municipality may establish specific site standards in the bylaws to regulate individual sites within preexisting mobile home parks with regard to distances between structures and other standards as necessary to ensure public health, safety, and welfare, provided the standards do not have the effect of prohibiting the replacement of mobile homes on existing lots.

A bylaw may require a single-family dwelling with an accessory dwelling unit to be subject to the same review, dimensional, or other controls as required for a single-family dwelling without an accessory dwelling unit. An accessory dwelling unit means a distinct unit that is clearly subordinate to a single-family dwelling, and has facilities and provisions for independent living, including sleeping, food preparation, and sanitation, provided there is compliance with all the following:

           "Farm" means a parcel or parcels owned, leased, or managed by a person, devoted primarily to farming, and subject to the RAP rules.

Indicators of such control include whether the lessee makes day-to-day decisions concerning the cultivation or other farming-related use of the leased lands and whether the lessee manages the land for farming during the lease period.

       <p>
        Former statute regarding existing small lots was meant to apply to contiguous lots, and the word "surrounding" was meant to include contiguous parcels only. In re Appeal of Jenness, 185 Vt. 16, 968 A.2d 316 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Term "surrounding" as it is used in the former statute governing existing small lots refers only to properties that are contiguous. In re Appeal of Jenness, 185 Vt. 16, 968 A.2d 316 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because only contiguous parcels were "surrounding" under the statute governing existing small lots, and the parties had stipulated that two lots separated by a public road were not contiguous, the parcels were not "surrounding" and therefore could not merge. Thus, the trial court erred in concluding that one of the lots in question was not an existing small lot. In re Appeal of Jenness, 185 Vt. 16, 968 A.2d 316 (2008).

        It is precisely the intent of the existing-small-lot exemption to permit development, without variances as to area or dimensions, of preexisting small lots. In re Appeal of Jenness, 185 Vt. 16, 968 A.2d 316 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Former existing-small-lot statute, which expressly sets minimum dimensions for existing small lots, was plainly intended to preempt otherwise applicable dimensional requirements. Thus, the trial court did not err in concluding that existing small lots were exempt from the otherwise applicable dimensional requirements in a town's bylaws. In re Appeal of Jenness, 185 Vt. 16, 968 A.2d 316 (2008).

       <p>
        Vermont statute provides that land development may be permitted on lots that do not have frontage on either a public road or public waters provided that the lot has approved access to a public road through a permanent easement or right-of-way. Thus, regardless of whether a road met the statutory definition of a public road, there was no question that it satisfied the alternative statutory basis for development as a "right-of-way" connecting to a public road. Regan v. Pomerleau, 197 Vt. 449, 107 A.3d 327 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prior decision by the Environmental Court that denied defendants' building permit due to a right-of-way not being wide enough to comport with zoning regulations did not invalidate the use of the right-of-way, such that the Environmental Court had no jurisdiction over a private zoning enforcement action regarding the use thereof. Nordlund v. Van Nostrand, 190 Vt. 188, 27 A.3d 340 (2011).

The landowners adduced substantial expert testimony that their wood-processing activities were supportive of, and closely interrelated with, their farming operation as a whole.

Where questions arise in the administration of this section that require more precise determinations of the location of any street right-of-way line on all drainageways or the location of any park, school, or any other public facility, the legislative body shall have a survey prepared of the street or section, park, school, or other public facility in question, that may by resolution of the legislative body become a part of the official map.

       Changes to the official map.
    
    After adoption of the official map, the recordation of plats that have been approved as provided by this chapter, or the adoption of any urban renewal plan under chapter 85 of this title, shall, without further action, modify the official map accordingly. Minor changes in the location of proposed public facilities may also be made to particular sections of the official map if the change is recommended by a majority of the planning commission and approved by resolution of the legislative body. This process may take place concurrently with review of development or subdivision of a parcel that is proposed to be subject to a map change.

    The adoption, as part of an official map, of any existing or proposed street or street line or drainageway, or any proposed park, school, or other public facility, shall not constitute a taking or acceptance of land by the municipality, nor shall the adoption of any street in an official map constitute the opening or establishment of the street for public use or obligate the municipality in any way for the maintenance of the street.

No person shall recover any damages for the taking for public use of any land development constructed within the lines of any proposed street, drainageway, park, school, or other public facility after it has been included in the official map, and any such land development shall be removed at the expense of the owner.

         A municipality may specify in its bylaws that conditional use review is required for any structure within the line of any public facility shown on the official map or within a specified area adjacent to the lines on the map. If conditional use review is required for these structures, the purpose of the review shall be to ensure that the structure is compatible with the location and function of existing and planned public facilities. If the conditional use is denied, the procedure provided in subdivision (4)(A) of this section shall be instituted.

Failure to accommodate the mapped public facility or obtain a minor change in the official map shall result in the denial of the development or subdivision. The legislative body shall have 120 days from the date of the denial of the permit to institute proceedings to acquire that land or interest in land, and if these proceedings are not started within that time, the appropriate municipal panel shall review the application without regard to the proposed public facilities.

        Subsection (d) of this section is unconstitutional as applied to consideration of permit applications filed after public notice, but before a town's adoption of amended zoning bylaws, and of applications filed after the town's adoption, but before the effective date of the adoption, of amended bylaws because it gives town selectboards unbridled discretion to decide whether to review applications under the old or new zoning bylaws, with no standards to limit the exercise of that discretion.

        Intent of the provision that, following public notice of a proposed zoning bylaw amendment, a town administrator may not issue a permit regarding that amendment during the period between notice and the effective date of the adoption or rejection of the amendment, except with the written consent of the town's legislative body after public notice and hearing, is to create a "moratorium" on the issuance of permits for proposed projects whose status may be affected by pending amendments to zoning bylaws. In re Handy, 171 Vt. 336, 764 A.2d 1226 (2000).

        Trial court reasonably concluded that neighbors had not created a structure or changed use of their land within meaning of statute requiring zoning permit, where neighbors created shooting range by cutting ten trees and constructing a backstop and shooting stand.

       <p>
        In issuing a permit under a zoning ordinance, municipal officials are discharging a governmental function and the unauthorized acts of such officials cannot estop the municipality from revoking a permit for a prohibited use. Maurice Callahan & Sons, Inc. v. Cooley, 126 Vt. 9, 220 A.2d 467 (1966), (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>

        A permit for a use prohibited by a valid zoning ordinance is void and subject to revocation. Maurice Callahan & Sons, Inc. v. Cooley, 126 Vt. 9, 220 A.2d 467 (1966).

        In order that there may be some finality to administrative determinations, successive applications to zoning authorities are required to be different in content or show that change in circumstances has intervened.

        That successive zoning applications be different in content or show that change in circumstances has intervened is not to be technically and narrowly imposed, but yet enforced to extent that property interests may be settled and stable, and property owners protected from harassment.

        4444 to be a civil penalty and the fine was not so punitive in nature or effect to negate the Legislature's intent, landowner's constitutional rights were not violated where he was not allowed to present affirmative defenses or cross-examine witnesses, and the town was not required to prove the violation beyond a reasonable doubt.

        ยง
        4444(a) upon town's attorney's fees and costs, as the fine was expressly limited to $50 per day and remained well within the statutory limits, and as the Legislature intended that the fine be civil and therefore remedial in nature. Town of Hinesburg v. Dunkling, 167 Vt. 514, 711 A.2d 1163 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a zoning enforcement action, the court did not abuse its discretion by deducting $4000 from the civil fine imposed against landowner to help defray his costs in attempting to comply with the permit conditions and not permitting town to recover administrative and investigative costs.

        </b>
       </h5>

        A trial court has only limited discretion to refuse to issue a mandatory injunction to enforce a zoning ordinance based on its balancing of the equities as, normally, public injury will be assumed to outweigh private cost; however, violation may be so insubstantial as to render enforcement inequitable, and an injunction may be an excessive remedy where the nonconforming use was constructed without knowledge of its noncompliance.

        Where defendants alleged to have violated zoning ordinance sought to rebut the presumption of the ordinance's validity by motion to reopen case, made after close of evidence but before findings, to allow them to present evidence showing the ordinance to be null and void, chancellor could not resolve the question whether defendants violated the ordinance without first determining the validity of the ordinance, because facts sufficient to establish substantial compliance with the zoning enabling act were essential to the decree.

        A zoning administrator is statutorily bound to enforce a municipality's zoning bylaws, but the nature of the remedy sought is discretionary; thus, an administrator has the discretion to initiate any appropriate action, injunction, or other proceeding to prevent, restrain, correct, or abate a violation.

        Where the zoning administrator pursued a remedy within his discretion, and it could not be said that he failed to act or perform a duty imposed by law, the court acted properly in dismissing the mandamus claim. Richardson v. City of Rutland, 164 Vt. 422, 671 A.2d 1245 (1995).

        Petitioners, adjacent landowners and interested persons, were entitled to writ of mandamus to compel town zoning administrator to enjoin property owners from using their property in violation of town zoning regulations; since property had been developed in violation of Superior Court order, State law, and town zoning regulations, petitioners were affected by violations and entitled to action sought in writ, writ sought enforcement of ministerial duties, and there was no other adequate remedy at law.

The compensation of the administrative officer shall be fixed under sections 932 and 933 of this title, and the officer shall be subject to the personnel rules of the municipality adopted under sections 1121 and 1122 of this title. The administrative officer shall administer the bylaws literally and shall not have the power to permit any land development that is not in conformance with those bylaws. An administrative officer may be removed for cause at any time by the legislative body after consultation with the planning commission.

       The administrative officer should provide an applicant with forms required to obtain any municipal permit or other municipal authorization required under this chapter, or under other laws or ordinances that relate to the regulation by municipalities of land development. If other municipal permits or authorizations are required, the administrative officer should coordinate a unified effort on behalf of the municipality in administering its development review programs. The administrative officer should inform any person applying for municipal permits or authorizations that the person should contact the regional permit specialist employed by the Agency of Natural Resources in order to assure timely action on any related State permits; nevertheless, the applicant retains the obligation to identify, apply for, and obtain relevant State permits.

        Environmental Division properly found that a zoning application had not been deemed approved. A city planner notified the applicant within five days of receiving his application that a permit could not issue because the proposed modifications would violate the historic preservation regulations of the city's zoning ordinance, and offered him the options of submitting a revised application or meeting with the design advisory board; the zoning administrator therefore complied with the statute and the city's zoning ordinance by issuing a decision on the permit application within thirty days.

        Property owner failed in its complaint that, because a dumpster was maintained in the disputed location for over fifteen years, the city's attempt at enforcing a violation was barred by the limitations period in this section; the section did not shield the owners from an enforcement action because there was no basis for the city to allege a violation until the date when service areas were created and the disputed area was designated as proposed storage.

A bylaw may provide for the conditioning of permit issuance on the submission of a bond, escrow account, or other surety in a form acceptable to the legislative body of the municipality to assure one or more of the following: the completion of the project, adequate stabilization, or protection of public facilities that may be affected by a project.

         Conditions may require that no zoning permit, except for any permits that may be required for infrastructure construction, may be issued for an approved development unless the streets and other required public improvements have been satisfactorily installed in accordance with the approval decision and pertinent bylaws. In lieu of the completion of the required public improvements, the appropriate municipal panel may require from the owner for the benefit of the municipality a performance bond issued either by a bonding or surety company approved by the legislative body or by the owner with security acceptable to the legislative body in an amount sufficient to cover the full cost of those new streets and required improvements on or in those streets or highways and their maintenance for a period of two years after completion as is estimated by the appropriate municipal panel or such municipal departments or officials as the panel may designate. This bond or other security shall provide for, and secure to the public, the completion of any improvements that may be required within the period fixed in the subdivision bylaws for that completion and for the maintenance of those improvements for a period of two years after completion.

         The performance bond required by this subsection shall run for a term to be fixed by the appropriate municipal panel, but in no case for a longer term than three years. However, with the consent of the owner, the term of that bond may be extended for an additional period not to exceed three years. If any required improvements have not been installed or maintained as provided within the term of the performance bond, the bond shall be forfeited to the municipality and upon receipt of the proceeds of the bond, the municipality shall install or maintain such improvements as are covered by the performance bond.

       Administrative review.
    
    In addition to the delegation of powers authorized under this chapter, any bylaws adopted under this chapter may establish procedures under which the administrative officer may review and approve new development and amendments to previously approved development that would otherwise require review by an appropriate municipal panel. If administrative review is authorized, the bylaws shall clearly specify the thresholds and conditions under which the administrative officer classifies an application as eligible for administrative review. The thresholds and conditions shall be structured such that no new development shall be approved that results in a substantial impact under any of the standards set forth in the bylaws. No amendment issued as an administrative review shall have the effect of substantively altering any of the findings of fact of the most recent approval. Any decision by an administrative officer under this subsection may be appealed as provided in section 4465 of this title.

       Role of advisory commissions in development review.
    
    An advisory commission that has been established through section 4433 or chapter 118 of this title and that has been granted authority under the bylaws, by ordinance, or by resolution of the legislative body to advise the appropriate municipal panel or panels, applicants, and interested parties should perform the advisory function in the following manner:
       <ol>
        <li id="t24p02c117sub10s4464ol1d1">
         The administrative officer shall provide a copy or copies of applications subject to review by the advisory commission and all supporting information to the advisory commission upon determination that the application is complete.
        </li>
        <li id="t24p02c117sub10s4464ol1d2">
         The advisory commission may review the application and prepare recommendations on each of the review standards within the commission's purview for consideration by the appropriate municipal panel at the public hearing on the application. The commission or individual members of the commission may meet with the applicant, interested parties, or both, conduct site visits, and perform other fact-finding that will enable the preparation of recommendations.
        </li>
        <li id="t24p02c117sub10s4464ol1d3">
         Meetings by the advisory commission on the application shall comply with the Open Meeting Law, 1 V.S.A. chapter 5, subchapter 2, and the requirements of the commission's rules of procedure, but shall not be conducted as public hearings before a quasi-judicial body.
        </li>
        <li id="t24p02c117sub10s4464ol1d4">
         The advisory commission's recommendations may be presented in writing at or before the public hearing of the appropriate municipal panel on the application, or may be presented orally at the public hearing.
        </li>
        <li id="t24p02c117sub10s4464ol1d5">
         If the advisory commission finds that an application fails to comply with one or more of the review standards, it shall make every effort to inform the applicant of the negative recommendations before the public hearing, giving the applicant an opportunity to withdraw the application or otherwise prepare a response to the advisory committee's recommendations at the public hearing. Advisory commissions may also suggest remedies to correct the deficiencies that resulted in the negative recommendations.

        Plain language of the provision regarding defective notice in municipal panel proceedings indicates it does not apply to situations where no notice at all is provided; the phrase "defect in the form or substance" assumes that notice has been given because there can be no defect in something that does not exist. Thus, whatever the scope of the phrase "defect in the form or substance," the word "defect" contemplates that some notice has been given, and where no notice is given, the provision is inapplicable.

        Even if there was a defect in the posting, the Environmental Division properly concluded that the applicant for a planned unit development made reasonable efforts to provide adequate posting and notice. First, all parties abutting the project received actual notice via the mail and the hearing was properly published in a newspaper of general circulation; second, testimony from the applicant's representative suggested that the town's zoning representative approved of the posting location; and finally, there was no evidence that the neighbors opposing the application were prejudiced by the alleged defect in the posting and the neighbors did not identify an injury stemming from the posting defect. In re Atwood Planned Unit Dev., 204 Vt. 301, 167 A.3d 312 (2017).

       <p>
        Environmental Division did not err in denying party status to appellants, who sought to challenge the approval of an application for a planned unit development but had not participated in the hearing before the development review board (DRB). As the DRB complied with the regulatory and statutory framework for providing both constructive and actual notice of the hearing, regardless of whether appellants had received actual notice, appellants were on constructive notice of the hearing; furthermore, there was no requirement that the notice apprise appellants and others of the potential success of the application. In re Appeal of MDY Taxes, 199 Vt. 248, 123 A.3d 1184 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appellants had failed to demonstrate that any injustice, let alone manifest injustice, would result from denying them the right to appeal the decision of the development review board (DRB) when they had not participated in the hearing before the DRB. The constructive notice provided adhered to the requirements of the law and expressly stated that the applicant was seeking to construct a car wash on its property; the fact that neither appellant actually viewed or scrutinized the notices provided did not make it manifestly unjust to deny them the ability to appeal. In re Appeal of MDY Taxes, 199 Vt. 248, 123 A.3d 1184 (2015).

        Deemed approval remedy did not apply when a board of zoning adjustment made a decision on a variance application within the prescribed period but failed to notify the applicants within that period of the decision and the bases for the decision. The deemed approval remedy was to be strictly construed to apply only when the decision was not made within the prescribed period, which was not the case here.

       <p>
        Occupier of land lacked standing to appeal to the Superior Court a grant of injunctive relief by zoning board of adjustment requiring removal of defendant's junk vehicles from the property pursuant to State junkyard statute; defendant was not an "interested person" within the meaning of zoning statute, as he held no form of title to the property and had, at best, an equitable mortgage interest. Town of Sandgate v. Colehamer, 156 Vt. 77, 589 A.2d 1205 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Occupier of land lacked standing to challenge the validity of a zoning ordinance in enforcement proceeding brought by town even though, as a result, he was without a forum in which to mount such challenge, as he also lacked standing to proceed under exclusive statutory remedy of appeal from decision of zoning administrator to issue citation for violation of the ordinance.

        So long as zoning board acts within the ambit of its variance authority, whether it has acted wisely or not is not a matter which the governing body can raise on appeal as an "interested person" under subdivision (b)(2) of this section.

        Finding that corporation had "common goal" or "shared interest" with record title holder was not sufficient to render corporation an "interested person" with standing to pursue an appeal in Superior Court of a denial of a conditional use zoning permit.

        Standing for review of all questions arising out of zoning laws is necessarily governed by this section, which limits review to those who qualify as "interested persons" under subsection (b). Garzo v. Stowe Board of Adjustment, 144 Vt. 298, 476 A.2d 125 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the Legislature, in subsection (b) of this section, has provided the exclusive definition of who has a clear legal right to compel the enforcement of zoning bylaws, proceedings in mandamus to compel such enforcement are not distinguished from, but are in fact controlled by, the standing criteria of this section. Garzo v. Stowe Board of Adjustment, 144 Vt. 298, 476 A.2d 125 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff, who brought suit to enforce a zoning bylaw, conceded that he was not an "interested person" within the meaning of subsection (b) of this section, the right he sought to enforce was therefore legislatively foreclosed and his application for mandamus properly denied. Garzo v. Stowe Board of Adjustment, 144 Vt. 298, 476 A.2d 125 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section's provision that a property owner in the immediate neighborhood alleging a decision or act will not be in accord with the zoning plan of the municipality may appeal to the Superior Court from a decision of the zoning board of adjustment, persons who claimed that decision violated the regulations implementing the plan had standing to appeal.

In re Fairchild, 159 Vt. 125, 616 A.2d 228 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where petitioners had taken every lawful step they could to enforce adherence to town zoning regulations and town refused to abide by court order and its own zoning regulations, statutory appeals process was not adequate to afford relief petitioners sought and mandamus was appropriate.

        Petitioners who sought writ of mandamus to compel issuance of building permits had adequate remedy through procedure for appeals and therefore could not obtain mandamus. Dana Corp. & Flanders v. Yusitis, 127 Vt. 201, 243 A.2d 790 (1968), (Decided under prior law.)

       <p>
        Having demonstrated standing by virtue of her status as an interested person as defined by this section, plaintiff satisfied all prerequisites to relief at law or equity, and her ability to request a mandatory injunction to compel defendant to remove a structure erected after defendant received an improperly issued zoning variance was in no way impaired by the absence of special damages.

       <p>
        Because a letter sent to the initial complainant by an employee in the Burlington Code Enforcement Office with a title of "zoning specialist" was not a decision of the zoning administrator, the complainant did not have to appeal it to the Development Review Board (DRB) to avoid the invocation of the provision pertaining to unappealed decisions. As a result, the provision did not preclude neighbors from requesting that the zoning administrator enforce the zoning ordinance against applicants and from appealing to the DRB from the zoning administrator's decision that a permit was not needed.

       <p>
        The availability of a variance is an essential part of the regulatory scheme to determine to what extent a landowner will be able to use his land. Chioffi v. City of Winooski, 165 Vt. 37, 676 A.2d 786 (1996).

        4470 of this title appellant automatically received a variance when zoning board of adjustment failed to comply with that section, and Superior Court so found. Potter v. Hartford Zoning Board of Adjustment, 137 Vt. 445, 407 A.2d 170 (1979), overruled on other grounds, City of Rutland v. McDonald's Corp. (1985) 146 Vt. 324, 503 A.2d 1138.

        Where evidence on application for enlargement and extension of nonconforming use was heard at public hearing of zoning board of adjustment which was adjourned with decision deferred, failure to notify the public and the board of later meeting at which enlargement was granted did not invalidate the order where it did not appear that further evidence was received at the later meeting and the later meeting was apparently held merely to arrive at a decision.

        The extension of a nonconforming use involves the exercise of powers distinguishable from, and more limited than, the exercise of the power to grant variances. DeWitt v. Town of Brattleboro Zoning Board of Adjustment, 128 Vt. 313, 262 A.2d 472 (1970).

       <p>
        Zoning variance must be based on showing of conformance with each of the five criteria set forth in subsection (a) of this section; therefore, if it is found that the court did not err on any one of the factors, Supreme Court must affirm. In re Dunnett, 172 Vt. 196, 776 A.2d 406 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Environmental Court's determination that applicant for variance for construction of a new structure on property could make reasonable use of the property without the addition of the structure, and therefore failed to qualify for a variance under second criterion in subsection (a) of this section, was neither clearly erroneous, arbitrary, nor capricious. In re Dunnett, 172 Vt. 196, 776 A.2d 406 (2000).

        Fact that part of property is an existing small lot or that another part was purchased later cannot be determinative of variance request. Blow v. Town of Berlin Zoning Administrator, 151 Vt. 333, 560 A.2d 378 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        In assessing the criteria set forth in subsection (a) of this section, zoning board of adjustment or court must look at all of the applicant's property, not solely that part included in variance request. Blow v. Town of Berlin Zoning Administrator, 151 Vt. 333, 560 A.2d 378 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Variances are not to be given to guarantee the most profitable use of the property. In re McDonald's Corp., 151 Vt. 346, 560 A.2d 362 (1989).

       <p>
        All five of the requirements set out in subsection (a) of this section must be met in order to sustain the granting of a zoning variance. In re Fecteau, 149 Vt. 319, 543 A.2d 693 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prior to the issuance of a variance from the provisions of a zoning regulation, a petitioner must meet each and every requirement outlined in this section. In re Maurice Memorials, 142 Vt. 532, 458 A.2d 1093 (1983).

       <p>
        All zoning variances, whether use or area variances, must meet the five criteria enunciated in this section which provides that on appeal the Superior Court may grant a variance and render a decision if all of certain facts are found. In re Ray Reilly Tire Mart, Inc., 141 Vt. 330, 449 A.2d 910 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The five criteria which must be met under this section, which provides that the Superior Court may grant a variance and render a decision if all of certain facts are found, apply to all variances of whatever type. Gadhue v. Marcotte, 141 Vt. 238, 446 A.2d 375 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although property as to which a variance was sought met requirement of subdivision (a)(4) of this section that variance would not alter essential character of neighborhood, nor impair use or development of adjacent property, nor be detrimental to public welfare, desirable improvement which met this test was not entitled to a variance in absence of all statutory criteria of this section being met. Sorg v. North Hero Zoning Board of Adjustment, 135 Vt. 423, 378 A.2d 98 (1977).

        When 25-foot strip of residential land lying within larger commercial and residential lot was too small to be developed without variance, developer's "hardship" was self-induced by identifying small part of land as variance area rather than looking at all of land, and variance was properly denied.

        Where applicant for zoning variance purchased only a small triangular piece of land which was but a part of a much larger parcel, and the original property as a whole could have been developed in strict conformity with the provisions of residential zoning regulation, the applicant was not entitled to a variance under subdivision (a)(3) of this section, since the hardship in applicant's situation arose solely from the acquisition of the small portion of the original property, and the hardship, therefore, was created by the applicant.

        Trial court erred in granting dimensional variance to property owner where the evidence did no support a finding that the owner's lot could not be further developed without a variance, since there was uncontroverted testimony by an expert that a residence could be built on the property in conformity with the zoning regulations, and, since the property was already developed and used as both a business and residence, the property owner was not deprived of a reasonable use of his property as required by subdivision (a)(2) of this section.

        When restaurant chain leased lot lying in both commercial and residential zones, proposed a restaurant in commercial zone and requested variance to use adjacent 25-foot strip of land in residential zone for parking lot, trial court properly applied zoning variance criteria in subsection (a) of this section to entire property.

        In a zoning dispute, because plaintiff-town fulfilled its statutory duties i.e., (1) the zoning board of adjustment (ZBA) informed defendant-landowner at its hearing that the hearing on his appeal was closed and that it would render a decision within 45 days; and (2) the ZBA later rendered its final decision and, within 45 days, mailed the minutes of the meeting by certified mail to defendant's correct address and received back a signed receipt and there was no evidence that plaintiff's purpose in using this procedure was to intentionally hinder defendant's ability to determine that a decision had been rendered, defendant received notice, and the time period in which he could appeal the decision began to run.

        That party appealing to Superior Court from decision of board of adjustment failed to furnish board with sufficient copies of the notice of appeal to enable the clerk to serve all persons pursuant to rule was not fatal to validity of appeal.

        Superior Court is without jurisdiction to hear appeals from boards of adjustment where there is no filing of notice of appeal with the board or where service with the board of the Superior Court complaint denominated as a notice of appeal is not timely; nor has the court jurisdiction where, following decision of the board of adjustment, a party brings a Superior Court action for declaratory and injunctive relief based on nonconstitutional grounds and a notice of appeal is not timely filed with the board. State Buildings Div. v. Town of Castleton Board of Adjustment, 138 Vt. 250, 415 A.2d 188 (1980).

        Where required notice of appeal was not filed in lower tribunal as required by rule, review was foreclosed. Harvey v. Town of Waitsfield, 137 Vt. 80, 401 A.2d 900 (1979).

        The purpose of a notice of appeal is to inform the parties and the tribunals concerned that the proceedings are not concluded, and to transfer jurisdiction to the appellate court. Badger v. Rice, 124 Vt. 82, 196 A.2d 503 (1963). (Decided under prior law.)

       </p>
       <p>
        An order to show cause can issue only after the commencement of an action, which is accomplished in zoning appeals to Superior Court from board of adjustment by filing with the board of adjustment, so that issuance of order to board to show cause was error where issued prior to service of complaint on the board, and court had no jurisdiction.

       </p>
       <p>
        Having demonstrated standing by virtue of her status as an interested person as defined by section 4464 of this title, plaintiff satisfied all prerequisites to relief at law or equity, and her ability to request a mandatory injunction to compel defendant to remove a structure erected after defendant received an improperly issued zoning variance was in no way impaired by the absence of special damages. In re Gadhue, 149 Vt. 322, 544 A.2d 1151 (1987).

        Adjoining landowner had a statutory right as an "interested person" to intervene in an appeal to the Environmental Court from a ruling of zoning board of appeals that relocation of a road required a subdivision permit. In re Shantee Point, Inc., 174 Vt. 248, 811 A.2d 1243 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where intervention in an appeal to the Environmental Court from final plat approval is timely, is not sought for an improper purpose, such as curing a jurisdictional defect, and is done simply to protect the interests of the intervening party, a court should not dismiss the appeal simply because the original party appealing is unable or unwilling to proceed with the case. In re Garen, 174 Vt. 151, 807 A.2d 448 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although intervention under the statute is a matter of right, the Environmental Court still may deny a motion to intervene if it is not made within a reasonable time period. In re Garen, 174 Vt. 151, 807 A.2d 448 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Motion to intervene that came twenty-two days after the original notice of appeal and prior to the filing of the statement of issues on appeal was not untimely or otherwise improperly granted. In re Garen, 174 Vt. 151, 807 A.2d 448 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Environmental Court properly denied intervenors' request to file their own separate statement of issues on appeal because an appeal to the Environmental Court is confined to the issues raised in the statement of questions filed pursuant to an original notice of appeal. In re Garen, 174 Vt. 151, 807 A.2d 448 (2002).

         11. Time limits.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The statute allowing an appeal to the Environmental Court by "[a]n interested person who has participated in a municipal regulatory proceeding" does not specify when the interested party must participate as long as it is within the proceeding. For subdivision proceedings, participation at preliminary plat review implements the intent of the Legislature, as does participation at final plat review. In re Carroll, 181 Vt. 383, 925 A.2d 990 (March 9, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Nothing in the language of the statute allowing an appeal to the Environmental Court suggests that one proceeding ends, and another begins, solely because the development review board renders an appealable decision. In fact, the statutory language giving the right to appeal "a decision rendered in that proceeding" suggests that there can be more than one appealable decision within a proceeding. The appealability of preliminary plat approval, if such a right of appeal exists, does not affect whether preliminary plat and final plat approval are part of the same proceeding. In re Carroll, 181 Vt. 383, 925 A.2d 990 (March 9, 2007).

        Absent any clear indication that a zoning administrator's approval of a fish and game club's permit application for previous construction intended to serve as a conditional use permit, which could only be granted by the town's development review board (DRB) under a zoning regulation, the Environmental Court did not err in interpreting the unappealed permit to grant only that which the club's application expressly requested-approval of previous construction. Thus, under the exclusivity-of-remedy provision in subsection (d) of this section, landowners were precluded from challenging the previous construction listed on the permit application and approved by the zoning administrator, but the zoning administrator's error did not transform the club's operation of a shooting range from a nonconforming use as a recreational facility to a conforming use within the zoning district. Accordingly, because the Environmental Court concluded from the evidence presented that the club's use of the facilities had expanded or intensified from its historic levels, it did not err in concluding that the club was required to seek approval from the DRB for that increased use.

Interested parties who received notice of the conditional-use determination and subsequent appeal of that determination but chose not to participate may not later contest issues necessarily decided therein, such as the determination that a convenience store with gas pumps is a permitted use.

        Provision of this section that, in absence of an appeal, all interested parties are bound by the decision or act and are barred from directly or indirectly contesting it did not apply either to grant of building permit or to ruling of administrator that no zoning permit was required, where plaintiff town was not contesting either the grant of the permit or the ruling, but rather, was claiming that the bounds of both were being exceeded by defendant, to whom the permit and ruling were given. Town of Bennington v. Hanson-Walbridge Funeral Home, Inc., 139 Vt. 288, 427 A.2d 365 (1981).

        Failure to appeal from administrative tribunal's denial of variance did not prevent landowner, in town's action to enjoin certain use of land, from raising defense of nonconforming use. Town of Shelburne v. Kaelin, 136 Vt. 248, 388 A.2d 398 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where landowners brought declaratory judgment action attacking rezoning and on suggestion of court applied for and were denied a variance and did not appeal the denial as provided by statute, review of denial failed for lack of proper appeal, and rezoning and its effect on landowners' property could not be attacked unless violation of constitutional right of landowners was alleged, in which case, under statute, administrative hearing is not required and case can be heard by Superior Court. Galanes v. Town of Brattleboro, 136 Vt. 235, 388 A.2d 406 (1978).

        Petitioners were not required to appeal town zoning administrator's refusal to enforce town zoning regulations prior to seeking writ of mandamus where they had appealed administrator's decision to issue conditional use permit, Superior Court had determined that conditional use permit would violate zoning regulations, and town continued to refuse to follow the law, despite court's order. In re Fairchild, 159 Vt. 125, 616 A.2d 228 (1992).

       <p>
        Where petitioners had taken every lawful step they could to enforce adherence to town zoning regulations and town refused to abide by court order and its own zoning regulations, statutory appeals process was not adequate to afford relief petitioners sought and mandamus was appropriate.

       <p>
        Because appellant had not appealed from the final certificate of compliance with arborvitae-screening requirements issued to a permit applicant, but only from the issuance of the second temporary certificate, his appeal alleging injury from the granting of the final certificate was a collateral attack on a zoning decision barred by the zoning exclusivity-of-remedy provision.

        Although there was a permit issued by a zoning board of appeals with preclusive effect, as the second step of review was conducted on a proposal that was significantly different from that approved by the Environmental Court, and there was no analysis of the differences from the permit conducted or a finding of the necessary substantial change, approval under the successive-application doctrine was not warranted. In re Application of Lathrop L.P. I, 199 Vt. 19, 121 A.3d 630 (2015).

       <p>
        Where sole zoning regulation relating to landscaping makes it discretionary with planning commission whether to impose any landscaping requirement, and if landscaping is required a strip of land at least 10 feet wide has to be left all around for landscaping, in a de novo hearing following appeal of administrative decision the same absolute discretion rests in the court and court must enforce the 10 foot minimum if in its discretion it imposes any landscaping requirement.

       <p>
        Where, on appeal from issuance of zoning permit, finding acknowledged that evidence suggested that proposed signs for restaurant did not comply with zoning regulations, and conclusion assumed that the signs were not in conformity with the regulations but concluded that planning commission had jurisdiction to correct the situation, there was error requiring remand from Supreme Court to lower court as under the de novo trial lower court had duty to enforce and the power to condition or waive the zoning regulations and could not abrogate its duty by leaving the issue to the planning commission.

In re Poole, 136 Vt. 242, 388 A.2d 422 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial similarity between findings of Superior Court and those of the two administrative bodies whose decisions were on review did not demonstrate that court merely reviewed the boards' findings in an appellate manner in disregard of its duty to conduct a de novo hearing where evidence had been presented which supported all the court's findings and Supreme Court could not say as a matter of law that the court failed to make its own determination of the probative effect of the competent evidence before it; but better procedure would have been to couch the findings in court's own language.

       <p>
        Where it was claimed that de novo hearing was wrongly withheld and that appellate court should not have admitted evidence of findings and conclusions of administrative tribunals below, the admission was not error if there was evidence before the court supporting all its findings and conclusions; and where record showed all facts found were put into evidence, all of the evidence could be said to have been heard anew.

       <p>
        Because of its purpose and effect, the statutory provision stating that "upon the expiration of a plan, all bylaws and capital budgets and programs then in effect shall remain in effect, but shall not be amended until a plan is in effect" embodies a substantive - not procedural - requirement, and the statute of limitations for challenging purported procedural defects therefor does not apply to challenges premised on the provision. Therefore, a town was not time-barred from challenging the validity of an ordinance under the provision. In re Paynter 2-Lot Subdivision, 187 Vt. 637, 996 A.2d 219 (mem.) (2010).

    It is further declared the state should exercise its powers in the interest of its governmental units to further and implement those policies by authorizing a state instrumentality to be created as a body corporate and politic to have full powers to borrow money and to issue its bonds and notes to make funds available through the facilities of that instrumentality at reduced rates and on more favorable terms for borrowing by governmental units through the purchase by that instrumentality of the bonds or notes of governmental units and by granting broad powers to the instrumentality to accomplish and to carry out the aforesaid policies of the state which are in the public interest of the state and of its taxpayers and residents.
    It is further declared to be in the public interest and is the policy of the state that state funds should be applied or authorized to be paid to any state instrumentality created pursuant to this act only to provide adequate assurance and security to the holders of bonds or notes of such instrumentality; and further that such instrumentality should so conduct its operations as to provide the lowest rates in terms of borrowing to governmental units as is consistent with a self-supporting operation with no expectation of subsidization with state funds."

      Notwithstanding any law applicable to any governmental unit as to the period for temporary financing of any public improvement or purpose by issuance of its notes in anticipation of the issuance of permanent bonds or as to the renewal of bond anticipation notes, the Bank may purchase and the governmental unit may issue bond anticipation notes and may renew them from time to time provided that the bond anticipation notes, including renewals thereof, mature in such amounts and in such years not exceeding five years from the date of the original issuance as is agreed between the Bank and the governmental unit.
    In connection with the transaction and purchase of bond anticipation notes, the Bank may by agreement with the governmental unit impose any terms, conditions, and limitations as in its opinion are proper and for the purposes and security of the Bank and the holders of its bonds or notes.
    The failure of any governmental unit to comply with that agreement constitutes a failure of the governmental unit to pay principal of and interest on the bond anticipation notes under section 4652 of this title, and the Bank shall thereupon enforce all such rights, remedies, and provisions of law as it has under this section or are elsewhere provided.

     <ol>
      <li id="t24p02c123s5001ol11">
       There exist in the various municipalities numerous dwellings and dwelling premises that are substandard due to dilapidation, deterioration and disrepair, structural defects, uncleanliness, lack of adequate ventilation, light, sanitary, heating and hot water facilities, overcrowding of dwellings, occupancy of unfit dwellings, and other conditions and defects which increase the hazards of illness, disease, fire, accidents, and other calamities;

        The language of 24 V.S.A. chapter 123 makes clear that the legislative intent was to provide for the health and safety of the general public, rather than for the protection of any individual class of persons. Corbin v. Buchanan, 163 Vt. 141, 657 A.2d 170 (1994).

        5005 provides an administrative remedy for violation of any ordinance enacted under 24 V.S.A. chapter 123, but nowhere in chapter 123 is there any suggestion that the General Assembly intended to create a private civil remedy; the social, fiscal, tax, and public policy implications of a statute creating a private right of action based on a town's adoption of building code regulations would be enormous, and there is no indication in this record that the Legislature contemplated any such consequences. Corbin v. Buchanan, 163 Vt. 141, 657 A.2d 170 (1994).

        5005 provides an administrative remedy for violation of any ordinance enacted under 24 V.S.A. chapter 123, but nowhere in chapter 123 is there any suggestion that the General Assembly intended to create a private civil remedy; the social, fiscal, tax, and public policy implications of a statute creating a private right of action based on a town's adoption of building code regulations would be enormous, and there is no indication in this record that the Legislature contemplated any such consequences.

        Trial court properly upheld a housing board's authority to conduct a hearing before a single member. The case did not involve an "appeal" to the board, which required that a majority of the board be present, but a first-instance security-deposit hearing.

This language is significant, revealing as it does a clear intent that the agency decision shall be considered "final" solely for purposes of administrative exhaustion and ripeness for subsequent judicial review, not as a bar to such review.

    Disconnection of water service as a collection procedure for delinquent sewer bills is specifically allowed.

        Parties' motions for summary judgment were granted in part and denied in part because the State's interest was in providing a collection method for municipal water service that adequately protected the rights of ratepayers and water users. Vermont's disconnect statute provided procedural due process to sufficiently protect a water user's interest in continued water service even when that water user was not a "ratepayer." Brown v. City of Barre, 878 F. Supp. 2d 469 (D. Vt. 2012).
