Upon petition of a party, filed within 30 days of issuance of the hearing officer's decision and order, or on its own motion, the Commission may determine that the hearing officer's decision and order should be treated as a proposal for decision and order as provided in subsection (c) of this section. The Commission may grant such request for good cause, including apparent error of fact, or procedural or substantive law, and may conduct additional evidentiary hearings or hear oral argument from the parties. If such request is not timely made, or is not granted by the Commission, the decision and order of the hearing officer shall become the final decision and order of the Commission.

         Legislature has granted the Public Utility Commission the powers of a court of record in the determination and adjudication of all matters over which it is given jurisdiction, including the power to render judgments, make orders and decrees, and enforce the same by any suitable process issuable by courts in the State. The statutory grant of power does include the authority to order the Agency of Natural Resources, as a party to a certificate of public good proceeding, to refund some or all of the fee allocated the Agency.

         Because the Board has all the powers of a trial court in the determination and adjudication of matters over which it has jurisdiction, a motion to disqualify counsel is a matter that rests within the Board's sound discretion, and its ruling will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing of an abuse of discretion.

        <p>
         In looking at adequacy of notice, Supreme Court examines whether or not parties were given adequate opportunity to prepare and respond to issues raised in proceeding. In re Twenty-Four Vermont Utilities, 159 Vt. 363, 618 A.2d 1309 (1992).
        </p>
        <p>
         Intervenors in Public Service Board hearing concerning waiver and release provision of electric power agreement were aware that Board had to act by specific date, intended to proceed with evidence as soon as Supreme Court ruled on remand request, and were fully aware of the issues, offering expert testimony on them; as such, reasonable notice requirements were not violated. In re Twenty-Four Vermont Utilities, 159 Vt. 363, 618 A.2d 1309 (1992).
        </p>
        <p>
         Waiver and release provision of electric power agreement between Vermont utilities and Canadian power company was a modification of an earlier agreement amendment; as such, because Public Service Board hearing on that amendment was properly noticed, new twelve-day notice period was not required for additional hearing on waiver and release. In re Twenty-Four Vermont Utilities, 159 Vt. 363, 618 A.2d 1309 (1992).

       A party to a cause who feels aggrieved by the final order, judgment, or decree of the Commission may appeal to the Supreme Court. However, the Commission, in its discretion and before final judgment, may permit an appeal to be taken by any party to the Supreme Court for determination of questions of law in such manner as the Supreme Court may by rule provide for appeals before final judgment from a Superior Court. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Vermont Rules of Civil Procedure or the Vermont Rules of Appellate Procedure, neither the time for filing a notice of appeal nor the filing of a notice of appeal, as provided herein, shall operate as a stay of enforcement of an order of the Commission unless the Commission or the Supreme Court grants a stay under the provisions of section 14 of this title.

         Railway company was free to bring suit in federal district court to restrain Public Service Commission from enforcing order as violating federal constitution, although appeal was not taken to state Supreme Court, since law relating to appeal did not attempt to confer legislative authority on court but only provided an alternative and more expeditious way of doing what might be done by bill in equity.

         This section is a measure of the relief available in the Supreme Court on issues properly there, not a jurisdictional statute. In re New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 131 Vt. 310, 305 A.2d 598 (1973).
        </p>
        <p>
         Since this section provides that an order of the Commission shall not be vacated by an appeal, appeals from its orders stand in the Supreme Court like cases there on exceptions, and appeal by one party does not take up the other party's assignments of error. Essex Storage Electric Co. v. Victory Lumber Co., 93 Vt. 437, 108 A. 426 (1919).
        </p>
        <p>
         On appeal from an order of the Commission the Supreme Court is not an appellate Public Service Commission, with all the power of commissioners. Bacon v. Boston & Maine Railroad, 83 Vt. 421, 76 A. 128 (1910).

          2. Stay.
         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         The function of the Supreme Court, or a justice of it, in passing upon a motion for a stay of a Public Service Board order pending appeal, is not to second-guess the Board, but to act in opposition only when the action of the Board cannot be supported. In re New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 145 Vt. 309, 488 A.2d 746 (1985).
        </p>
        <p>
         In considering whether to stay a Public Service Board order pending appeal, the Supreme Court looks at the likelihood of success of the appealing party on the merits, whether the party seeking the stay will suffer irreparable injury if the stay is not granted, whether the issuance of a stay will substantially harm other parties, and the location of the best interests of the public. In re New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 145 Vt. 309, 488 A.2d 746 (1985).
        </p>
        <p>
         Ratepayers would not suffer irreparable injury if a stay of a utility rate increase were not to be granted, since the Public Service Board could insure that the utility, through payments or credits to its customers, repaid all excess revenues it had collected if such measures became necessary. In re New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 145 Vt. 309, 488 A.2d 746 (1985).
        </p>
        <p>
         Since motion involved stay of a Public Service Board order, the primary authority for hearing on the motion was this section's provision calling for a decision on suspension of the order "as justice and equity require," which would be construed to mean that the responsibility for deciding upon the advisability of a stay is principally, as well as initially, in the Board. In re Allied Power & Light Co., 132 Vt. 554, 326 A.2d 160 (1974).
        </p>
        <p>
         The function of the Supreme Court, or a Justice of it, in passing upon a motion for a stay of a Public Service Board order, is not to second-guess the Board, but to act in opposition only when the action of the Board cannot be supported, or in cases where intervening events call into question the advisability of a stay under the changed circumstances, in which case, better practice might dictate that the matter of a stay be remanded to the Board for reconsideration. In re Allied Power & Light Co., 132 Vt. 554, 326 A.2d 160 (1974).
        </p>
        <p>
         Alleged strain on welfare recipients resulting from utility rate increase allowed by Public Service Board was not a factor to be considered by Supreme Court on motion to stay, pending appeal, order allowing the increase. In re Allied Power & Light Co., 132 Vt. 554, 326 A.2d 160 (1974).
        </p>
        <p>
         Grant of injunction by lower court restraining implementation of purchase power and fuel adjustment clause the court had found invalid had the effect of accomplishing a stay of a Public Service Board order allowing the clause and could not stand where there was emphatic legislative policy under this section and section 12 of this title restricting suspension of such orders to the Board, or the Supreme Court or a Justice thereof on appeal. Moore v. Gilbert, 132 Vt. 365, 321 A.2d 13 (1974).

Payments into the Public Service Reserve Fund shall be made as follows: All electric distribution companies, cooperative, municipal, and privately owned, which have been allocated a share of St. Lawrence power by the Department, shall pay into the State Treasury for such reserve on or before September 15, 1961 and September 15, 1962, in addition to the taxes now required by law to be paid, a tax to produce a total of $37,500.00 in the aggregate for each such payment to be paid by each such company in proportion to its purchase of St. Lawrence power, during the calendar years 1959 and 1960. Thereafter, on June 30 of each year, there shall be deducted from the balance in the special fund for the maintenance of the Department's engineering and accounting force and personnel employed by the Commission the tax revenues payable under section 22 of this title in that year, and the balance thus determined shall be transferred from the special fund for the maintenance of the engineering and accounting force to the Public Service Reserve Fund; provided, however, that, if at June 30 of any year the balance in such public service reserve fund shall be in excess of $100,000.00, the amount of such excess shall forthwith be transferred to the General Fund.

       The assessment by the Commission or Department of Public Service of any tax or penalty under the provisions of sections 20-25 of this title may be appealed to the Washington Superior Court. The appeal shall be filed within 90 days after the receipt by the company or its agent of written notice by the Commission or Department of its assessment. Thereupon, appropriate proceedings shall be had and the relief, if any, to which the company may be found entitled may be granted and any taxes, interest, or penalties paid, found by the Court to be illegally assessed, shall be ordered refunded to the company with interest at six percent per annum from the time of payment, with costs, and judgment entered accordingly.

         Establishment of a temporary meteorological tower without obtaining a certificate of public good is a violation of the statute governing temporary siting of meteorological stations; therefore, section (a)(2) of the penalty statute, not section (a)(1), provides the appropriate civil penalty. In re Constr. & Operation of a Meteorological Tower, 210 Vt. 27, 210 A.3d 1230 (2019).

         The only way an applicant could start the streamlined certificate of public good approval process was by filing a registration form with the Public Utility Commission. Here, petitioner stipulated that it had installed at least 134 systems without first filing the appropriate registration forms; by failing to do so, petitioner failed to take advantage of the net-metering approval process and failed to obtain the necessary certificates of public good prior to beginning construction, in violation of the statute that prohibited any corporation from constructing a new electric-generation facility without first obtaining a certificate of public good, and a civil penalty was appropriate.

      <p>
       Whenever the Department of Public Service is of the opinion that a company subject to its supervision is failing or omitting or is about to fail or omit to do anything required of it by law or by order of the Commission or is doing anything or permitting anything or is about to do anything or to permit anything to be done contrary to or in violation of law or of any order of the Commission, the Department of Public Service may commence an action or proceeding in the Superior Court for the purpose of having such violations or threatened violations stopped and prevented by injunction. Such action or proceeding shall begin by a petition alleging the violation complained of and praying for appropriate relief by way of injunction.
    It shall thereupon be the duty of the court to specify the time, not exceeding 21 days after service of a copy of the petition, within which the company complained of must answer the petition, and the court may grant a temporary injunction in accordance with the laws of the State and rules in such case made and provided.
    The obtaining of a temporary injunction shall constitute a waiver by the State of its sovereign immunity to pay the person enjoined damages as such person may sustain by reason for such injunction if the court shall eventually decide that the State was not equitably entitled thereto and the State shall be liable to pay to the person enjoined such sums as would be payable by any other person in the premises.
    In case of default in answer, or after answer, the court shall immediately inquire into the facts and circumstances in such manner as the court directs without other or formal pleadings and without respect to any technical requirement.
    Such other persons or corporations as it shall seem to the court necessary or proper to join as parties in order to make its order, judgment, or writs effective may be joined as parties upon application of counsel to the Department.
    The final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall either dismiss the action or proceeding or direct that an injunction be issued as prayed for in the petition or in such modified form as the court may determine will afford appropriate relief.

       The General Assembly finds that there is a need for a coordinated public safety message on the normal storage and handling of propane tanks and fuel oil tanks, and for the recovery of propane tanks and fuel oil tanks that are displaced by a natural disaster, such as flooding. The Department of Public Service, the Division of Fire Safety, and the Agency of Natural Resources shall cooperate with relevant municipal, professional, and industry organizations to develop a variety of educational materials for distribution to the public to provide information on any special treatment of propane tanks that might be required in the event of a natural disaster, such as flooding.

    A certification may be issued by a builder, a licensed professional engineer, a licensed architect, or an accredited home energy rating organization. If certification is not issued by a licensed professional engineer, a licensed architect, or an accredited home energy rating organization, it shall be issued by the builder.

Any person certifying shall use this certificate or one substantially like it to certify compliance with RBES. Certification shall be issued by completing and signing a certificate and permanently affixing it to the outside of the heating or cooling equipment, to the electrical service panel located inside the building, or in a visible location in the vicinity of one of these three areas. The certificate shall certify that the residential building has been constructed in compliance with the requirements of the RBES. The person certifying under this subsection shall provide a copy of each certificate to the Department of Public Service and shall assure that a certificate is recorded and indexed in the town land records. A builder may contract with a licensed professional engineer, a licensed architect, or an accredited home energy rating organization to issue certification and to indemnify the builder from any liability to the owner of the residential construction caused by noncompliance with the RBES.

       Revision and interpretation of energy standards.
    
    On or before January 1, 2011, the Commissioner shall complete rulemaking to amend the commercial building energy standards to ensure that commercial building construction must be designed and constructed in a manner that complies with ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA standard 90.1-2007 or the 2009 edition of the IECC, whichever provides the greatest level of energy savings. At least every three years after January 1, 2011, the Commissioner of Public Service shall amend and update the CBES by means of administrative rules adopted in accordance with 3 V.S.A. chapter 25. The Commissioner shall ensure that appropriate revisions are made promptly after the issuance of updated standards for commercial construction under the IECC or ASHRAE/ANSI/IESNA standard 90.1, whichever provides the greatest level of energy savings. Prior to final adoption of each required revision of the CBES, the Department of Public Service shall convene an Advisory Committee to include one or more mortgage lenders; builders; building designers; architects; civil, mechanical, and electrical engineers; utility representatives; and other persons with experience and expertise, such as consumer advocates and energy conservation experts. The Advisory Committee may provide the Commissioner of Public Service with additional recommendations for revision of the CBES.

        The Legislature has given the right to the Public Service Board to order condemnation when the Board finds that it is necessary in order that the utility may render adequate service to the public, and in electric cases the test for adequacy is to deduct the largest single source of power supply from all other sources which are available and apply the result to the required load.

       <p>
        In a condemnation case, a utility presented sufficient evidence that the chosen route for the pipeline through a park was the best option when all four alternative routes were inferior to the proposed easement for multiple reasons, including being longer and less linear, causing traffic problems, and causing adverse effects on natural resources and aesthetics. Furthermore, the absence of comparative cost data did not undermine the Public Service Board's conclusions, and while the board might have been mindful of the costs of delay, the court did not read its analysis as relying to any great degree on that factor. In re Vt. Gas Sys., 205 Vt. 509, 174 A.3d 1253 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Record supported the Public Service Board's finding of the necessity of condemning a corridor on a landowner's property to extend utility lines to the property of a neighbor who intended to build a home there. The Board found that: (1) placing the easement on the landowner's property would cover the shortest distance, involve the least amount of tree clearing and aesthetic impact, and be the least expensive option; (2) the proposed route through the landowner's property would extend an existing and well-established utility corridor that already included a utility pole and lines on the property; (3) in contrast to a proposed alternative that would run the lines along a nearby road, the town did not raise any concerns about placing the line through the existing corridor on the landowner's property; (4) the cleared easement corridor would remain well-screened and not visible from the road; (5) the view from landowner's property would remain largely unaffected; (6) all of the other suggested alternatives, apart from placing the lines underground, would result in the same or greater cost to the neighbor and impact to the environment; and (7) the expense of underground lines could not be justified by any potential benefits to landowner. In re Cent. Vt. Pub. Serv. Corp., 187 Vt. 598, 992 A.2d 308 (mem.) (2010).

         8. Compensation.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Public Service Board did not substantively stray from the statutory standard in awarding a landowner $250 for the easement taken. In so doing, the Board adopted the hearing officer's conclusions, supported by the record, that the landowner retained access to and use of the underlying real estate and that it was hardly more impacted by the new easement than from preexisting easements; the Board determined that extending the utility easement corridor on landowner's property approximately 115 feet would have virtually no effect on the value of the remaining property in light of the evidence presented. In re Cent. Vt. Pub. Serv. Corp., 187 Vt. 598, 992 A.2d 308 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Testimony upon which the Public Service Board relied in setting compensation was not improperly admitted. The hearing officer did not rely upon the valuation opinion of a witness who was not an expert; moreover, the Board explicitly found that the landowner's objections to the pre-filed testimony of both witnesses was untimely. In re Cent. Vt. Pub. Serv. Corp., 187 Vt. 598, 992 A.2d 308 (mem.) (2010).

     Legislative findings.

    <cite class="vt-code">2013, No. 89</cite>,
    
     ยง
    
    1 provides: "The General Assembly finds that:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(1) The primary driver of climate change in Vermont and elsewhere is the increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO
     2
     ) from the burning of fossil fuels. The warming caused by carbon dioxide is amplified multiple times because atmospheric water vapor, another greenhouse gas, increases as temperature increases.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) The primary sources of Vermont's greenhouse gas emissions are the consumption of fossil fuels for transportation fuels and for heating buildings and water (thermal energy). In 2010, CO
     2
     and equivalent emissions from Vermont energy consumption totaled approximately eight million metric tons (MMTCO
     <span class="s2">
      2
     </span>
     ). Of this total, transportation fuel use accounted for approximately 3.5 and nonelectric fuel use by homes and businesses for approximately 2.5.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(3) Another result of high fossil fuel consumption is that the average Vermonter and the Vermont economy are facing a fuel affordability challenge of historic proportions. In 2010, Vermonters paid over $600 million to import fossil fuels for use in their homes, businesses, and other buildings, almost $300 million more than Vermont paid in 2000.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(4) In January 2013, the Department of Public Service submitted the report of its Thermal Energy Task Force (the Task Force). Among other things, the Task Force found that: 'Investing in thermal efficiency improvements . . . can dramatically reduce heating energy use in a building. At current fuel prices, thermal efficiency improvements can bring savings of approximately $1,000.00 per year over the lifetime of the investment . . . .
    As each year passes and investments are not made, cost burdens must be borne by individual Vermonters, businesses and property owners - collectively burdening the Vermont economy as a whole.'
    </p>
    <p>
     "(5) This burden is felt most by Vermonters of limited means or on fixed incomes, such as persons who may be elderly or have disabilities. These Vermonters face the dilemma of being unable to pay for heat as fuel prices rise and federal fuel assistance is reduced. Since 2009, the percentage of an average recipient household's heating costs paid by Vermont's fuel assistance program has dropped precipitously, primarily because of cuts to the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) totaling approximately 40 percent. Benefits have been cut almost in half from a seasonal high of over $1,700.00 to $900.00, and the percentage paid of the average recipient household's bill has dropped from 86 percent to 32 percent. While the State of Vermont has attempted to soften the blow to date, the State's ability to continue to provide fuel assistance funding is limited, and additional LIHEAP cuts may result from the so-called federal 'sequester.'
    </p>
    <p>
     "(6) Many Vermonters who receive financial assistance from the state and federal governments to meet their heating needs live in poorly insulated buildings. The level of expenditure necessary to heat these homes could be significantly decreased if appropriate and cost-effective thermal energy efficiency measures applied. Reducing fuel consumption through weatherization services would decrease the need for supplemental assistance in individual units and allow limited funds to cover a greater number of needy residents. Conversely, as the Task Force found: 'Delaying weatherization for this population places more pressure on other public resources such as the Low-Income Heating Assistance Program (LIHEAP).'
    </p>
    <p>
     "(7) The Task Force found that substantial public investment would be necessary to meet the State's statutory goals for improving the energy fitness of its homes and buildings. At this investment level, the Task Force found that, over the life of the energy efficiency measures, over $1.4 billion would be saved, approximately 800 job-years would be created, and 6.8 million tons of CO would be kept from entering the atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(8) Vermont must act to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and consumption of fossil fuels. The State must encourage the efficient use of energy to heat buildings and water in order to reduce Vermont's carbon footprint and fuel costs and make heating more affordable for all Vermonters."

       The text of this section is based on the harmonization of two amendments. During the 2019 session, this section was amended twice, by Act Nos. 31 and 59, resulting in two versions of this section. In order to reflect all of the changes enacted by the Legislature during the 2019 session, the text of Act Nos. 31 and 59 was merged to arrive at a single version of this section, using the codification scheme adopted in Act No. 59 to redesignate as subdiv. (4) the definition of "energy storage facility" enacted as subsec. (b) by Act No. 31, and eliminating the duplicative lead-in language "As used in this chapter" from the beginning of the redesignated subdiv. The specific changes that each of the amendments made are described in the amendment notes set out below.

       <p>
        In determining whether to grant a certificate of public good (CPG) to a public utility that had formerly been private, the Public Service Board was entitled to consider the past management practices of the utility. The Board's consideration of past acts did not violate any constitutional rights nor constitute retroactive application of 30 V.S.A.
        ยง
        203(6); any CPG applicant must expect the Board to consider past incidents of mismanagement in making its decision and the utility had no vested property right to conduct a business that could be affected by the Board's denial. In re Quechee Service Co., 166 Vt. 50, 690 A.2d 354 (1996).

        The Public Service Board has no jurisdiction over a water corporation that limits its service to members only, since it does not offer a service to the general public but only to its own corporate membership. 1966-68 Op. Atty. Gen. 153.

        Statute authorizing Public Service Board (PSB) to require that part of costs of operating Vermont Power Exchange (VPX), State's purchasing agent for power delivered by small power producers pursuant to Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act (PURPA), be borne by regulated electric utilities is not an invalid delegation of legislative functions, as PSB's decision regarding VPX fees is guided by standards set forth in PURPA.

         a uniform mitigation charge imposed for the benefit of the issuer on the consumption of all electricity within the State of Vermont to the extent such electricity is conveyed to consumers by electric utilities, and a requirement that such charge be reflected on ratepayer bills in a manner which clearly reflects both the amount of the charge and the reduction in power costs resulting from the charge;

         a specific mechanism for automatic adjustment of the mitigation charge, at least annually, in accordance with electricity consumption forecasts prepared by the Rule 4.100 purchasing agent or other entity approved by the Commission, so that the mitigation charge is imposed at all levels designed to provide revenues sufficient to make timely payments of accrued interest and scheduled principal on all mitigation bonds, as well as ongoing administrative expenses, credit enhancement fees, and scheduled overcollateralization amounts with respect to such mitigation bonds. This automatic adjustment may implement a system in which the mitigation charge is initially paid in full by the electric utilities, and uncollectable amounts plus reasonable carrying costs are reimbursed to the utilities as part of the adjustment;

    The Department of Public Service, with the approval of the Commission, is authorized and empowered to enter into contracts for the transmission of such energy from the place of purchase to the point or points of resale.
    The Department shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that the contracts it enters into for the transmission, purchase, and wholesale or retail sale of electricity shall be in writing.

       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section the basis of the Public Service Board's regulatory authority is extremely broad and unconfining with respect to means and methods available to that body to achieve the stated goal of adequate service at just and reasonable rates.

       </h5>
       <p>
        When setting rates for a utility subject to its jurisdiction, Public Service Board is guided by statutory requirement that ratepayers pay just and reasonable rates only. In re Vermont Telephone Co., 169 Vt. 476, 739 A.2d 671 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Public Service Board is required to set rates that are just and reasonable. In re Village of Hardwick Electric Dept., 143 Vt. 437, 466 A.2d 1180 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The duty of the Public Service Board is to set just and reasonable rates. In re Central Vermont Public Service Corp., 141 Vt. 284, 449 A.2d 904 (1982); In re Central Vermont Public Service Corp., 143 Vt. 120, 463 A.2d 525 (1983); In re New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 145 Vt. 309, 488 A.2d 746 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        In fulfilling its responsibility under this section, it is the duty of the Public Service Board to first find that a rate is unjust or unreasonable, and then to make such changes as it finds will make rates just and reasonable. In re Green Mountain Power Corp., 131 Vt. 284, 305 A.2d 571 (1973).

       <p>
        Public Service Board's approval of electric rate redesign was not clearly erroneous, where Board was aware of shortcomings of cost-of-service study and based its decision principally on other evidence, including expert testimony, indicating that occupancy and usage patterns of short-term rental units differed from typical residential dwellings, and that intermittent use billed at residential rate did not contribute proportionately to recovery of fixed costs in electrical plant and equipment. In re Central Vermont Public Service Corp., 167 Vt. 626, 711 A.2d 1158 (mem.) (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        In fixing rates that are just and reasonable, the Public Service Board must balance the interests of the consumer and of the owners of the utility; rates cannot be set so low as to be confiscatory for the utility nor so high as to be excessive for the consumer. In re Village of Hardwick Electric Dept., 143 Vt. 437, 466 A.2d 1180 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fixing of just and reasonable rates involves balancing of investor and consumer interests. In re New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 115 Vt. 494, 66 A.2d 135 (1949).

        Discrimination in rates may be removed by raising the lower rate, lowering the higher rate, or by equalizing by a combination of both. In re New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 116 Vt. 480, 80 A.2d 671 (1951).

        The Public Service Commission has no power to cure discrimination in rates by an order which would result in the company operating under unreasonably low and confiscatory rates during the period when the assumed unjustly discriminatory rates were in effect.

       </h5>
       <p>
        This section gives the Board broad authority over the acts and practices of the utility relating to its services and allows it to make orders intended to induce the utility to furnish adequate service. In re Green Mountain Power Corp., 142 Vt. 373, 455 A.2d 823 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The very breadth of this section's grant of authority to the Public Service Board in the area of rates and service imposes a duty on the Supreme Court, in examining the Board's decisions, to require as part of the order that there be full disclosure of the criteria underlying the decision and the methodology employed to evaluate the facts and integrate them into the result. In re Green Mountain Power Corp., 142 Vt. 373, 455 A.2d 823 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order of the Public Service Board allowing cost of load management equipment to be included in utility's rate base was not improper where the Board found that such equipment was vital to a utility in order to prevent a waste of energy resources, order included a timetable for installation of the equipment, with monthly updates on progress, and the order provided that, in the event the utility did not substantially comply with the order, the Board would not only entertain a motion by the Department of Public Service to remove the load equipment from the rate base, but would also require a refund of all rates paid by the customers based on the presence of the projected cost in the rate base.

        Public Service Board has the power and duty to prevent unjust discrimination in rates charged by a public utility and to substitute rates found to be just and reasonable. In re Milton Water Corp., 125 Vt. 487, 218 A.2d 710 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Public Service Commission may, in substituting such rates as it shall find to be just and reasonable, prescribe different rates for two or more periods of time. In re New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 116 Vt. 480, 80 A.2d 671 (1951).

       <p>
        To substitute its regulations for those which a utility has previously adopted and filed, the Public Service Board must first find the individual company's regulations to be unjust, unreasonable, insufficient, unjustly discriminatory, or preferential under this section.

         10. Findings.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where in determining the amount of recoupment to be awarded to a public utility the Public Service Board found that the utility's power costs had increased, but rather than exercising its discretion to decide what amount of the increased costs, if any, should be awarded limited the amount it awarded to the amount the utility originally requested as a rate increase and made no findings to indicate that the amount it awarded was just and reasonable, its failure to do so constituted an abuse of discretion. In re Central Vermont Public Service Corp., 143 Vt. 120, 463 A.2d 525 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Service Board's finding, unaccompanied by any factual supporting statements, that in many respects utilities' disconnect practices and procedures were arbitrary, unjust, discriminatory and oppressive, was a conclusory finding covering approximately 180 utilities without examination of the regulations of each and did not comply with rate-making requirements made applicable by reason of fact order promulgating disconnect regulations affected rates.

       <p>
        This section, in effect, guarantees to a public utility company that the rates found by the Public Service Commission to be just and reasonable shall so be in fact and in law under tests applied on judicial review, and, by necessary implication, gives the same guarantee as to the rate of return on which the rates are based.

         13. Special contracts.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Public Service Board's order requiring incumbent local telephone exchange carrier to include shared and common fixed costs in the price floor for services provided in special contracts did not arbitrarily and improperly contradict its precedent by expanding upon the categories of costs that the carrier must include in the price floor. In re New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 172 Vt. 405, 779 A.2d 693 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Service Board's order requiring incumbent local telephone exchange carrier to impute the shared and common fixed costs in its special contracts was consistent with the Board's goal in creating pricing rules to encourage competition because it prevents the carrier from using revenues from monopoly services to subsidize special contracts subject to competition. In re New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 172 Vt. 405, 779 A.2d 693 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Based on its conclusion that services of a local telephone exchange carrier were not special, but simply volume discounts, the Public Service Board did not err in ruling that, as such, they should not be offered in special contracts but should be offered in tariffed volume-based discounts available to all customers to ensure that rates do not unjustly discriminate between similarly situated customers. In re New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 172 Vt. 405, 779 A.2d 693 (2001).

         14. Bottleneck facilities.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Public Service Board did not err in concluding that toll and business exchange services were bottlenecks although they were no longer exclusively provided by incumbent local telephone exchange carrier. In re New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 172 Vt. 405, 779 A.2d 693 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Service Board did not err in its conclusion that incumbent local telephone exchange carrier did not meet its burden of showing that its special access for toll service is no longer a bottleneck, because its decision was consistent with its precedent and its requirements for showing that facilities are no longer bottlenecks. In re New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 172 Vt. 405, 779 A.2d 693 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Service Board did not err in its decision that incumbent local telephone exchange carrier failed to meet its burden of showing that Centrex services are no longer a bottleneck input. In re New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 172 Vt. 405, 779 A.2d 693 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Service Board did not err by imposing a statewide test to determine whether a facility is a bottleneck because; the decision was consistent with precedent; such policy decisions are properly made by the Board; and the Board stated in its decision that "any incumbent, remains, of course, free to request the Board to find that a particular facility is no longer a bottleneck (throughout its service territory or in more narrowly defined geographies)."

       Notwithstanding section 218 and sections 225-227 of this title, upon petition of an electric or natural gas company, upon request of the Department of Public Service, or on its own initiative, the Public Utility Commission may, after opportunity for hearing, approve alternative forms of regulation for an electric or natural gas company; provided, however, in the case of a municipal plant or department formed under local charter or chapter 79 of this title or an electric cooperative formed under chapter 81 of this title, any alternative forms of regulation approved by the Commission shall also be approved by a majority of the voters of a municipality or cooperative voting upon the question at a duly warned annual or special meeting held for that purpose.

       Within a time to be fixed by the Commission, each company subject to the provisions of this chapter shall file with the Department, with separate filings to the Directors for Regulated Utility Planning and Public Advocacy, schedules which shall be open to public inspection, showing all rates, including joint rates, for any service performed or any product furnished by it within the State, and as a part thereof shall file the rules and regulations that in any manner affect the tolls or rates charged or to be charged for any such service or product. Those schedules, or summaries of the schedules approved by the Department, shall be published by the company in two newspapers with general circulation in the State within 15 days after such filing. A change shall not thereafter be made in any such schedules, including schedules of joint rates or in any such rules and regulations, except upon 45 days' notice to the Commission and to the Department of Public Service, and such notice to parties affected by such schedules as the Commission shall direct. The Commission shall consider the Department's recommendation and take action pursuant to sections 226 and 227 of this title before the date on which the changed rate is to become effective. All such changes shall be plainly indicated upon existing schedules, or by filing new schedules in lieu thereof 45 days prior to the time the same are to take effect. Subject only to temporary increases, rates may not thereafter be raised without strictly complying with the notice and filing requirements set forth in this section. In no event may a company amend, supplement, or alter an existing filing or substantially revise the proof in support of such filing in order to increase, decrease, or substantiate a pending rate request, unless, upon opportunity for hearing, the company demonstrates that such a change in filing or proof is necessary for the purpose of providing adequate and efficient service. However, upon application of any company subject to the provisions of this chapter, and with the consent of the Department of Public Service, the Commission may for good cause shown prescribe a shorter time within which such change may be made; but a change which in effect decreases such tolls or rates may be made upon five days' notice to the Commission and the Department of Public Service and such notice to parties affected as the Commission shall direct.
      </li>
      <li id="t30p01c05sub01s225ol1b">
       Immediately upon receipt of notice of a change in a rate schedule filed by a company, the Department shall investigate the justness and reasonableness of that change. Within 30 days of receipt of this notice, the Department shall either report to the Commission the results of its investigations together with its recommendation for acceptance of the change, or it shall notify the Commission and other parties that it opposes the change. If the Department of Public Service reports its acceptance of the change in rates, the Commission may accept the change, or it may on its own motion conduct an investigation into the justness and reasonableness of the change, or it may order the Department to appear before it to justify its recommendation to accept the change. In no event shall a change go into effect without the approval of the Commission, except when a rate change is suspended and temporary or permanent rates are allowed to go into effect pursuant to subsection 226(a) or 227(a) of this title. The Commission shall consider the Department's recommendation and take action pursuant to sections 226 and 227 of this title within 45 days of receipt of notice of a change in a rate schedule. In the event that the Department opposes the change, the Commission shall hear evidence on the matter and make such orders as justice and law require. In any hearing on a change in rates, whether or not opposed by the Department, the Commission may request the appearance of the Attorney General or appoint a member of the Vermont bar to represent the public or the State.

        The fact that subsection (a) of this section allows the Public Service Board to grant utility rate increase without specific prior notice to ratepayers does not deprive ratepayers of due process of law contrary to Fourteenth Amendment guarantees, since due process protections apply strictly only to agency determinations which are adjudicative in nature, and ratemaking proceedings that affect customers of a utility generally are legislative in nature.

        Where appellants did not contend that utility's filings and notices failed to comport with this section, and appellants plainly had notice of proposed rate redesign and opportunity to present evidence, cross-examine witnesses, and file briefs, this was all the process that was due. In re Central Vermont Public Service Corp., 167 Vt. 626, 711 A.2d 1158 (mem.) (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Water company's requested rate increase did not go into effect by default because Public Service Board failed to deny increase 45 days after company had filed its application; for purpose of computing seven-month period within which Board could issue its ruling under section 227(a) of this title, "date that the change otherwise would have gone into effect" was first billing date more than 45 days after filing.

       <p>
        The rates a utility can lawfully charge a consumer are governed by its schedule of tariffs filed in accordance with the provisions of this section, and when the schedule becomes effective, those rates are established as the lawful rate which the utility can charge and which the consumer is required to pay to obtain service. North v. City of Burlington Electric Light Dept., 125 Vt. 240, 214 A.2d 82 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        Promulgation and publication of rates for water service and for electricity constitutes an offer to furnish such services to all eligible persons who may apply therefor; continuing contract is effected when such offer is accepted by any such eligible persons.

       </p>
       <p>
        Purchase power and fuel adjustment clause which was subject to indefinite and irregular variation without the advance notice called for in this section could not be treated as a fixed part of a rate schedule. In re Allied Power & Light Co., 132 Vt. 354, 321 A.2d 7 (1974).

       <p>
        Power company's proposed rate increase could not be dismissed, prior to the time for presentation of evidence by company, for failure to accompany the proposal with sufficient substantiating evidence. In re Green Mountain Power Corp., 139 Vt. 368, 428 A.2d 1134 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where power company filed two separate and different proposed rate increases, the second asking for a rate increase in addition to that asked for by the first, separate rights accrued to the company under each filing and the rights in regard to the first filing could fail for lack of support in the evidence, but Public Service Board had no authority to extinguish them by treating the second filing as a substitute for the first, without support from proof or agreement of the parties.

       <p>
        Public Service Board, having ordered that filed rates not go into effect until final determination of the proceedings, did not have authority under subsec. (a) of this section to extend by its own order the suspension of those filed rates beyond the time period authorized by section 227(a) of this title.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Provision of subsec. (a) of this section dealing with temporary rate increases does not require compelling and necessitous circumstances to justify awarding of temporary rate relief; section 227 of this title, authorizing a utility to put proposed rates in place if the Public Service Board fails to make its determination within a specified time, compels an inference that the temporary rate provision is intended to permit the Board to deal with a pressing situation that does not justify allowing the proposed rates to take effect, but justifies some affirmative action before final disposition can assuredly be had.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Subsec. (a) of this section does not require compelling and necessitous circumstances to justify the awarding of temporary rate relief; the logic and language of the subsection, taken in connection with the general regulatory purpose of the legislative scheme, indicate that nothing by way of special standards of need or financially critical circumstances relating to a utility need be demonstrated in order to justify the exercise of the discretionary power of the Board to award temporary rate relief, subject to the overriding constant that the rate be "just and reasonable." In re Green Mountain Power Corp., 142 Vt. 373, 455 A.2d 823 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Service Board had authority to grant a second temporary rate increase even though a first temporary rate increase was still in effect. In re Green Mountain Power Corp., 133 Vt. 107, 329 A.2d 372 (1974).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The use of adjectives "immediate," modifying "temporary rate increase," and "preliminary," modifying "hearing," in subsec. (a) of this section indicates that the temporary rate hearing is not by any means intended to require the full and detailed explanation of the supporting and opposing issues related to the usual rate increase. In re Green Mountain Power Corp., 142 Vt. 373, 455 A.2d 823 (1983).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Since the language of subsec. (a) of this section expresses the imposition of temporary rates as an alternative available to the board to its prohibition of the taking effect of a filed rate change, and it is that prohibition that supports the implementation of filed rates after the time period prescribed in
        ยง
        227(a) of this title, such implementation is not available where the Board's order provides for temporary rate increases, and a utility may be required to operate under such temporary rates until termination of the proceedings.

        This section, which permits retroactive adjustments in utility rates, by providing that if a temporary rate increase is placed in effect pending final determination of a rate case the utility must refund, with interest, all sums collected in excess of the rate finally determined to be just and reasonable, and section 227 of this title, providing similar relief to ratepayers when the Public Service Board initiates a rate investigation on its own motion and eventually determines that rates should be reduced, are designed to insure that rate changes that are the subject of a rate case take effect in seasonable time so that neither the utility nor the ratepayers are prejudiced by the delays involved in deciding the case.

If at any time the General Assembly is concerned that such conditions exist, it may, by joint resolution, direct the Commission to conduct a hearing and make a determination thereon. If the Department and the company fail to reach a negotiated agreement within four months of receipt of an order to negotiate from the Commission, the Commission shall hold a hearing to determine the appropriate content of the relevant portions of the contract.

        Findings supported conclusions of Public Service Board that telecommunications contract was just and reasonable: price levels were reasonable because they were lower than they would otherwise have been; rate increase as only substantive change supported conclusion that it would promote the general good, and although Board did not explicitly state that contract supported reasonable competition, that conclusion was apparent when reading Board's order in conjunction with prior orders.

Within 20 days after issuance of a proposed order under this section, any party may submit comments and may offer to provide additional evidence concerning the proposed order. After review of such comments, and after conducting any additional hearings that the Commission determines to be necessary, the Commission shall issue a final order with such modifications as the Commission determines to be necessary to satisfy the requirements of this section.

        When setting rates for a utility subject to its jurisdiction, Public Service Board is guided by statutory requirement that ratepayers pay just and reasonable rates only. In re Vermont Telephone Co., 169 Vt. 476, 739 A.2d 671 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Water company's requested rate increase did not go into effect by default because Public Service Board failed to deny increase 45 days after company had filed its application; for purpose of computing seven-month period within which Board could issue its ruling under subsection (a) of this section, "date that the change otherwise would have gone into effect" was first billing date more than forty-five days after filing. In re Quechee Water Co., 159 Vt. 122, 615 A.2d 1026 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        In imposing a seven month limit for the Public Service Board to decide cases under this section, the legislature must be deemed to have given the Board sufficient control over matters brought before it to enable such proceedings to be completed within the time prescribed; the Board therefore is not obligated to litigate issues of enormous complexity under circumstances where no probability has been demonstrated that the exploration of those issues will have any effect whatsoever on the outcome of the case.

        Section 226 of this title, dealing with temporary rate increases, does not require compelling and necessitous circumstances to justify awarding of temporary rate relief; subsection (a) of this section, authorizing a utility to put proposed rates in place if the Public Service Board fails to make its determination within a specified time, compels an inference that the temporary rate provision is intended to permit the Board to deal with a pressing situation that does not justify allowing the proposed rates to take effect, but justifies some affirmative action before final disposition can assuredly be had.

        Public Service Board did not err in ordering telephone company to eliminate from its rate base, over a 10-year amortization period, amounts relating to a ratepayer-generated tax account maintained by a predecessor corporation; Board's findings were sufficient to support its conclusion that $1.8 million of amount paid by telephone company to acquire portion of predecessor corporation represented cost-free capital that ratepayers had provided to predecessor, and that this was a cost of acquisition ratepayers should not rightfully bear.

The Department, within 12 days, shall review the petition and file a recommendation regarding the petition in the same manner as is set forth in subsection 225(b) of this title. Such recommendation shall set forth reasons why the petition shall be accepted without hearing or shall request that a hearing on the petition be scheduled.

If the Commission finds that the operation of such business will promote the general good of the State, it shall give such person, partnership, unincorporated association, or previously incorporated association a certificate of public good specifying the business and territory to be served by such petitioners. For good cause, after opportunity for hearing, the Commission may amend or revoke any certificate awarded under the provisions of this section. If any such certificate is revoked, the person, partnership, unincorporated association, or previously incorporated association shall no longer have authority to conduct any business which is subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission whether or not regulation thereunder has been reduced or suspended, under section 226a or 227a of this title.

The Department shall select one or more service providers as needed and pursuant to a competitive bidding process to implement those programs, measures, or compensation mechanisms by means of performance-based contracts that are based upon verified savings in energy usage and demand, and other performance targets. The contracts entered into during the first year after March 19, 2008 shall be for a period of time of no greater than three years.

The Commission may alter or impose conditions on any combination of these programs, measures, or compensation mechanisms as it deems necessary to promote the public good. If the Department thereafter changes the programs, measures, or compensation mechanisms, it shall request review under this section by the Commission prior to implementing those changes.

       As used in this section, a "meteorological station" consists of one temporary tower, which may include guy wires, and attached instrumentation to collect and record wind speed, wind direction, and atmospheric conditions.
      </li>
      <li id="t30p01c05sub01s246ol1b">
       The Public Utility Commission shall establish by rule or order standards and procedures governing application for, and issuance or revocation of, a certificate of public good for the temporary installation of one or more meteorological stations under the provisions of section 248 of this title. A meteorological station shall be deemed to promote the public good of the State if it is in compliance with the criteria of this section and the Commission's rules or orders. An applicant for a certificate of public good for a meteorological station shall be exempt from the requirements of subsection 202(f) of this title.

       <ol>
        <li id="t30p01c05sub01s246ol1c1">
         Shall develop a simple application form and shall require that the applicant first file the application with the Commission and that, within two business days of notification from the Commission that the application is complete, the applicant serve copies of the complete application on the Department of Public Service, the Agency of Natural Resources, the Agency of Transportation, and the municipality in which the meteorological station is proposed to be located.
        </li>
        <li id="t30p01c05sub01s246ol1c2">
         Shall require that if no objections are filed within 30 days of the date of service of the complete application under subdivision (1) of this subsection, and the Commission determines that the applicant has met all of the requirements of section 248 of this title, the certificate of public good shall be issued for a period that the Commission finds reasonable, but in no event for more than five years. Upon request of an applicant, the Commission may renew a certificate of public good. Upon expiration of the certificate, the meteorological station and all associated structures and material shall be removed, and the site shall be restored substantially to its preconstruction condition.
        </li>
        <li id="t30p01c05sub01s246ol1c3">
         May waive the requirements of section 248 of this title that are not applicable to meteorological stations, including criteria that are generally applicable to public service companies as defined in this title. The Commission shall not waive review regarding whether construction will have an undue adverse effect on aesthetics, historic sites, air and water purity, the natural environment, and the public health and safety.
        </li>
        <li id="t30p01c05sub01s246ol1c4">
         Shall seek to simplify the application and review process, as appropriate, in conformance with this section.

      <li id="t30p01c05sub01s246ol1d">
       A proposal for decision shall be issued within five months of when the Commission receives a completed application for a certificate of public good for the temporary installation of one or more meteorological stations under the provisions of section 248 of this title.

      <li id="t30p01c05sub01s246ol1e">
       Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of this section, the holder of a certificate of public good for a constructed meteorological station may apply under section 248a of this title or 10 V.S.A. chapter 151 to convert the station to a wireless telecommunications facility, provided the application is filed at least 90 days before the expiration of the certificate for the station. Any such application shall constitute a new application to be reviewed under the facts and circumstances as they exist at the time of the review.

       <p>
        Legislature intended for the statute governing temporary siting of meteorological stations to govern whether and how to obtain a certificate of public good for temporary meteorological towers as an independent statutory scheme, and the statute governing new gas and electric purchases, investments, and facilities does not apply except as incorporated within the statute governing meteorological stations.

         2. Authority of commission.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Application of the "reasonably related" standard in the context of proceedings under the statute governing temporary siting of meteorological stations comports with Public Utility Commission (PUC) precedent and the history of the relationship between it and the statute governing new gas and electric purchases, investments, and facilities. A temporary meteorological tower is within PUC jurisdiction under the statute governing meteorological stations if it is "reasonably related" to construction or establishment of a grid-connected wind generation facility.

         3. Violations.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Establishment of a temporary meteorological tower without obtaining a certificate of public good is a violation of the statute governing temporary siting of meteorological stations; therefore, section (a)(2) of the penalty statute, not section (a)(1), provides the appropriate civil penalty. In re Constr. & Operation of a Meteorological Tower, 210 Vt. 27, 210 A.3d 1230 (2019).

         4. Particular cases.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Based on appellant's statements, actions, and outward manifestations of intent, including a declaration of planned community in which he stated that he might develop an electrical generation wind farm on his property, his consultations for a proposal to install a meteorological tower on the property, and his stated interest in determining what type of wind was available on the ridgeline for wind turbines, his tower was reasonably related to determining the site's suitability for a grid-connected wind turbine, and thus met the definition of a "temporary meteorological station" and required a certificate of public good prior to its construction. In re Constr. & Operation of a Meteorological Tower, 210 Vt. 27, 210 A.3d 1230 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        To establish that a temporary meteorological tower satisfies the "reasonably related" standard and is within Public Utility Commission jurisdiction under the statute governing temporary siting of meteorological stations, an objective review of the circumstances must demonstrate that the tower was constructed or installed to help determine the site's suitability for a grid-connected wind turbine. Such inquiries will be fact intensive and determined on a case-by-case basis. In re Constr. & Operation of a Meteorological Tower, 210 Vt. 27, 210 A.3d 1230 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        To demonstrate that a temporary meteorological tower was established to help determine a site's suitability for a grid-connected wind turbine, the reviewer may rely on a host of factors, including - but not limited to - the station's size and scope, the project proponent's actions and outward manifestations of intent, the project proponent's statements of subjective intent, the existence of plans for a grid-connected wind turbine, and subsequent development of a grid-connected project.

    1 provided: "The general assembly finds there is a remote possibility that sets of circumstances could occur causing sudden problems with electric power transmission or generating systems or natural gas facilities.
    In addition, there is the possibility a terrorist incident elsewhere could create difficulties with energy distribution within Vermont.
    These situations require a faster process than the required statutory process for obtaining a certificate of public good before commencing work.
    Even when the governor declares a state of emergency because of anything other than an enemy attack on Vermont, existing statutes could seriously slow the repair of electric or natural gas systems in the State.
    This act provides an expedited process to keep these essential systems operating in these emergency situations, while still providing for a subsequent review process to determine the repairs are in the public good."

A temporary meteorological tower is within PUC jurisdiction under the statute governing meteorological stations if it is "reasonably related" to construction or establishment of a grid-connected wind generation facility.

        Legislature intended for the statute governing temporary siting of meteorological stations to govern whether and how to obtain a certificate of public good for temporary meteorological towers as an independent statutory scheme, and the statute governing new gas and electric purchases, investments, and facilities does not apply except as incorporated within the statute governing meteorological stations.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Legislature has granted the Public Utility Commission the powers of a court of record in the determination and adjudication of all matters over which it is given jurisdiction, including the power to render judgments, make orders and decrees, and enforce the same by any suitable process issuable by courts in the state. The statutory grant of power does include the authority to order the Agency of Natural Resources, as a party to a certificate of public good proceeding, to refund some or all of the fee allocated the Agency.

       <p>
        It was not an abuse of discretion for the Public Service Board to dismiss an application for a wind turbine net metering system when the applicant failed to provide evidence that he had taken significant steps to minimize the negative effects that the project would have on the view of a neighbor, and he also failed to present specific evidence supporting his contentions that siting the turbine at alternative locations caused problems and increased costs associated with the project. In re Halnon, 174 Vt. 514, 811 A.2d 161 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Applicant for a wind turbine net metering system failed in his claim that the Public Service Board's denial of his application was inconsistent with its decision in another case because the proposal in that case was for a turbine site in a significantly dissimilar environment, and it was not abuse of discretion for the Board to find the proposal in the instant case offensive or shocking to the average person. In re Halnon, 174 Vt. 514, 811 A.2d 161 (mem.) (2002).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The Public Service Board was not required to review the sale of a nuclear power facility under the provision requiring it to weigh the costs and benefits to Vermont of hosting a nuclear power plant that sells most of its power to entities outside Vermont because the claim that the proposed sale meant a change in use of the facility had no support in the Board's unchallenged fact findings. In re Proposed Sale of Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station, 175 Vt. 368, 829 A.2d 1284 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Provision of this section pertaining to the review of purchase and sale agreements of electric generation facilities by the Public Service Board enumerates just two events that trigger its application: (1) "site preparation for" or (2) "construction of" an electric transmission or generation facility; thus, if the facility already exists, the provision applies only if the site preparation or construction is outside the usual course of business and involves new facilities that are neither replacement facilities nor equivalent to those that currently exist. In re Proposed Sale of Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station, 175 Vt. 368, 829 A.2d 1284 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Language of this section pertaining to the review of purchase and sale agreements of electric generation facilities by the Public Service Board evinces no intent to require the owner or operator of an existing electric generation plant to seek such review before changing its sales portfolio or selling its ownership interest. In re Proposed Sale of Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station, 175 Vt. 368, 829 A.2d 1284 (2003).

        Although allegedly not signed by all requisite utilities, waiver and release provision of electric power agreement between Vermont utilities and Canadian power company was ripe for review by Public Service Board. In re Twenty-Four Vermont Utilities, 159 Vt. 363, 618 A.2d 1309 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even assuming that Public Service Board was statutorily required to review waiver and release provision of electric power agreement between Vermont utilities and Canadian power company, it was not required to reconsider entire agreement, since the Board was not required to amend its prior approval, which was based on the pre-modification agreement, or to reopen the evidence related to the prior approval. In re Twenty-Four Vermont Utilities, 159 Vt. 363, 618 A.2d 1309 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        When deciding whether to approve electric power purchase contracts, the Public Service Board is engaged in a legislative, policy-making process in which it uses its discretion to weigh alternatives presented, utilizing particular expertise and informed judgment.

        The necessity of taking an individual's property or an interest therein is not an issue in a proceeding under this section; the sole issue is the determination of whether or not under the criteria set forth in this section the proposal for which the certificate was sought advances the public interest.

         4. Factors considered.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Public Utility Commission (PUC) did not violate the statute governing administrative decisions and orders by failing to make a ruling on the applicant's proposed findings regarding the alleged economic benefit of a net-metered solar electric-generation facility and by failing to consider whether the project would promote the general good of the state, as it had found that the project did not satisfy two of the other criteria for a certificate of public good (CPG), and all of the criteria had to be satisfied for a CPG to issue. In re Derby GLC Solar, 211 Vt. 144, 221 A.3d 777 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        "General good of the state" required by one section of the statute regarding certificates of public good is a broader concern than the call for some, albeit possibly limited, positive impact amounting to "an economic benefit" required by another section of the statute. In re Amended Petition of UPC Vt. Wind, LLC, 185 Vt. 296, 969 A.2d 144 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the plain terms of the statute regarding certificates of public good, the Public Service Board need only give "due consideration" to the recommendations of the municipal and regional planning commissions in deciding if a project will not unduly interfere with the orderly development of the region. In re Amended Petition of UPC Vt. Wind, LLC, 185 Vt. 296, 969 A.2d 144 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        In denying a certificate of public good for a wind turbine net metering system, the Public Service Board did not err by relying exclusively on observations made during its site visit, where, besides the site visit, the Board made 60 other findings based on testimony regarding the nature and scale of the turbine and the surrounding area and the project. In re Halnon, 174 Vt. 514, 811 A.2d 161 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        In denying certificate of public good for proposed cogeneration facility, Public Service Board did not commit error in favoring concern for ratepayers over concern for return on utility's investment, where proposed project sought rates higher than those mandated by federal law. In re East Georgia Cogeneration Limited Partnership, 158 Vt. 525, 614 A.2d 799 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Service Board's adoption of rate schedule did not preclude its review of whether proposed cogeneration facility, at requested rates, would provide needed power and economic benefits to State of Vermont. In re East Georgia Cogeneration Limited Partnership, 158 Vt. 525, 614 A.2d 799 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Service Board finding that electric power contract would not adversely effect power system reliability was sufficiently supported by evidence presented, which showed that power and energy under contract could be supplied without new supplier facilities, contract only extended in time current level of power reliably being provided Vermont utilities by supplier, and contract itself provided for substantial compensation in event supplier was unable to meet contract requirements because of termination or modification of licenses or permits. In re Twenty-Four Vermont Utilities, 159 Vt. 339, 618 A.2d 1295 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Service Board could approve electric power contract based on general statewide need for the energy without a showing of specific need for allocation assigned to each utility, and Board could analyze allocations in a separate proceeding. In re Twenty-Four Vermont Utilities, 159 Vt. 339, 618 A.2d 1295 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Service Board is statutorily required to look at the effects of a purchase of imported power on people and the environment outside Vermont only insofar as they directly affect the state of Vermont or its people, environment or economy. In re Twenty-Four Vermont Utilities, 159 Vt. 339, 618 A.2d 1295 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        To approve an electric power agreement, the Public Service Board need not find the contract absolutely reliable; it need only find that the contract will not have an adverse effect on the reliability of the power system.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Public Utility Commission did not err in finding that a solar net-metering system would not have an undue adverse effect, as any project-related sound impacts would be temporary, the project would not unduly interfere with the orderly development of the region in that regardless of whether an initial letter of support was signed by a majority, the selectboard and the planning commission had ratified their support for the project, there was evidence supporting the findings as to air pollution, greenhouse gas, wetlands, water supply, soil erosion, and transportation, and a construction staging area was not subject to setbacks. In re Acorn Energy Solar 2, LLC, - Vt.
    - , 251 A.3d 899 (Jan. 15, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Utility Commission did not err in finding that a net-metered solar electric-generation facility would have an adverse economic impact because it would add to an overburdened system, increase costs to ratepayers, and offer no relative benefits such as providing cleaner or more reliable generation. Furthermore, the historical reasons for the curtailment situation in the area were outside the scope of the proceeding. In re Derby GLC Solar, 211 Vt. 144, 221 A.3d 777 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Applicant for a certificate of public good, which argued that the interpretation of the statute governing such certificates by the Public Utility Commission (PUC) conflicted with past agency interpretations of the statute, had not identified any previous PUC decisions to support this contention and therefore failed to meet its burden of showing that the PUC had inconsistently applied the statute. Furthermore, the PUC could consider changed circumstances in assessing whether new applications complied with a Comprehensive Energy Plan. In re Derby GLC Solar, 211 Vt. 144, 221 A.3d 777 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Utility Commission (PUC) had not engaged in improper burden shifting in denying the applicant a certificate of public good. The record showed that the other parties presented evidence to support their position that the project would not advance the goals of the Comprehensive Energy Plan and would cause undue adverse impacts on Vermont utilities and ratepayers; the applicant essentially was arguing that the PUC should have accepted its version of the facts instead. In re Derby GLC Solar, 211 Vt. 144, 221 A.3d 777 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Conclusion by the Public Utility Commission (PUC) that the proposed project would not unduly interfere with orderly development of the region rested on findings that did not support it. The select board's decision not to oppose the project as violating the town plan, on which the PUC heavily relied, did not necessarily mean anything; in fact, the town had taken no position as to the project's overall compliance with the town plan. In re Petition of Apple Hill Solar LLC, 211 Vt. 54, 219 A.3d 1295 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Utility Commission erred in concluding that a project would not have an unduly adverse aesthetic effect, as the record did not support the threshold determination that the town plan did not constitute a clear, written community standard intended to protect aesthetics. The significance of the town's decision not to oppose the project based on the town plan was minimal; counsel's statements did not support a finding of inconsistent application of the town plan standards; and a town planner's testimony did not support the finding of inconsistent application. In re Petition of Apple Hill Solar LLC, 211 Vt. 54, 219 A.3d 1295 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        The only way an applicant could start the streamlined certificate of public good approval process was by filing a registration form with the Public Utility Commission. Here, petitioner stipulated that it had installed at least 134 systems without first filing the appropriate registration forms; by failing to do so, petitioner failed to take advantage of the net-metering approval process and failed to obtain the necessary certificates of public good prior to beginning construction, in violation of the statute that prohibited any corporation from constructing a new electric-generation facility without first obtaining a certificate of public good, and a civil penalty was appropriate. In re Investigation into Solarcity Corp., 210 Vt. 51, 210 A.3d 1255 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to file registration forms for a net-metering system was not a clerical error, but was a substantive violation of the statute that prohibited any corporation from constructing a new electric-generation facility without first obtaining a certificate of public good. Accordingly, the Public Utility Commission did not err in finding a violation regardless of whether petitioner's error was unintentional.

        With regard to a certificate of public good for a solar electric generation facility, there was support, including an independent analysis by the Vermont Division for Historic Preservation, for the Public Service Board's finding that the project would not have an undue adverse impact on historic sites. In re Petition of Rutland Renewable Energy, LLC, 202 Vt. 59, 147 A.3d 621 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        In granting a certificate of public good for a solar electric generation facility, the Public Service Board properly found that the project would not have an undue adverse impact on aesthetics, as setback requirements in the municipal plan and could not be considered a community standard because they would allow the town rather than the State to control solar generation and did not identify specific areas or resources for protection, the Board considered the neighbors' perspective and required extensive screening to mitigate that impact, and the neighbors did not offer a fully formed proposal for an alternative setback requirement. In re Petition of Rutland Renewable Energy, LLC, 202 Vt. 59, 147 A.3d 621 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        In granting a certificate of public good for a solar electric generation facility, the Public Service Board properly found the assertion of regional impact inadequate and not persuasive, as there was no actual evidence of regional impact aside from a prediction of future replication.

        In awarding a certificate of public good to construct a wind-electric generation facility, the Public Service Board properly found that the project complied with noise standards to protect public health. The Board imposed absolute noise standards and required the implementation of a comprehensive noise-monitoring plan; its operating conditions effectively ensured that the project would comply with the Board's sound standard, regardless of the precise accuracy of the noise-level estimates in the testimony. In re Joint Petition of Green Mountain Power Corp., 192 Vt. 429, 60 A.3d 654 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        In awarding a certificate of public good to construct a wind-electric generation facility, the Public Service Board acted well within its discretion in classifying a certain restriction as a technical error. It was readily apparent from the Board's order that it approved up to a twenty-one turbine wind-generation facility and that it expressly approved a particular turbine model. In re Joint Petition of Green Mountain Power Corp., 192 Vt. 429, 60 A.3d 654 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        With regard to an application for a certificate of public good to construct a wind-electric generation facility, the record supported the Public Service Board's finding that mitigation and decommissioning measures would limit the impacts of clearing to being adverse in nature, rather than unduly adverse. While it was true that at the time of his prefiled testimony, a witness believed that the impacts to these forests would be unduly adverse, he stated in his live testimony that the project's effects on the two state-significant forest types had been mitigated such that they were adverse but not unduly so. In re Joint Petition of Green Mountain Power Corp., 192 Vt. 429, 60 A.3d 654 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Towns failed to meet their burden of demonstrating that the Public Service Board violated their constitutional right to due process by not holding an evidentiary hearing on whether a utility's efforts were sufficient to address the damage caused to easement parcels. The Board informed the parties in advance of the process to be followed, and it would create substantial procedural expense for the parties and for the Board to hold a full-blown technical hearing every time there was a post-certification claim that any number of conditions had not been complied with. In re Joint Petition of Green Mountain Power Corp., 192 Vt. 429, 60 A.3d 654 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether a condition to granting a certificate of public good had been satisfied, the Public Service Board did not err in finding that remediation and mitigation were sufficient to counter the otherwise undue adverse impacts to the natural environment posed by the project. The Board concluded that a utility remediated the tree cutting activities on the original easement parcels to the fullest extent possible, and further that the additional conservation easements obtained as supplemental mitigation - when combined with the original easements subject to additional restrictions - would provide a greater degree of wildlife protection than the original easements alone. In re Joint Petition of Green Mountain Power Corp., 192 Vt. 429, 60 A.3d 654 (2012).

        Public Service Board properly found that a solar energy farm would not have an "undue adverse effect" on aesthetics. The record, including testimony by a land-use planner about the project's visibility and its consistency with town and county plans, supported its decision.

        Public Service Board's determination that the general good would not be promoted unless approval of a project was conditioned upon the requirement that the applicant make further efforts to enter into stably priced contracts with Vermont utilities did not detract from its explicit finding that the project demonstrated economic benefits. The promotion of the general good of the State can plainly encompass the potential for even greater economic benefit from taking advantage of a particular efficiency, such as a sustainable no-cost fuel source, as envisioned by the Board's decision.

        Given a project's not insignificant impacts, it was fully within the Public Service Board's purview to condition approval on the applicant making further efforts to exploit its advantage to reach stably priced contracts for the sale of electricity insulated from market fluctuations so as to enhance the project's benefit to the utility ratepayers at large. In imposing this requirement, the Board did not ignore a substantive issue mandated by statute for consideration; instead, it fulfilled its statutory mandate, finding that the project, with conditions, satisfied the applicable statutory requirements, provided benefits greater than its adverse impacts, and, accordingly, promoted the general good of the state. In re Amended Petition of UPC Vt. Wind, LLC, 185 Vt. 296, 969 A.2d 144 (2009).

        Public Service Board did not err in finding that a project would not unduly interfere with the orderly development of the region. The Board acknowledged that the project was inconsistent with some provisions in the regional plan, but found that the plan did not prohibit the project and, in fact, that it encouraged development of wind power; the plan did not prohibit the development of commercial-scale wind energy; and it was not unreasonable for the Board to find that the project would affect only a small portion of the land designated as rural under the regional plan. In re Amended Petition of UPC Vt. Wind, LLC, 185 Vt. 296, 969 A.2d 144 (2009).

       <p>
        It is elemental that each case turns on its own facts, and determining the degree of adverse aesthetic effect is a matter of weighing the evidence, a role for the Public Service Board rather than for the court. Because the Board applied the appropriate standard in evaluating the aesthetic impact of a project, its conclusion was supported by its findings, and its findings were supported by the record, the court would not disturb the Board's assessment of the weight of the evidence on appeal.

         9. Intervention.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Public Utility Commission properly granted permissive intervention to a homeowners' association and a country club on the ground that they articulated potential aesthetic injuries that fell within the scope of the interests protected by the statute governing certificates of public good and that were uniquely felt by them, as they raised concerns resulting from increased noise and wind and the effect on their views. In re Chelsea Solar LLC, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (Apr. 16, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Utility Commission (PUC) properly denied appellant's motion to intervene as of right in a certificate of public good proceeding, as the Court deferred to the PUC's interpretation of its own rule to require that a substantial interest be a sufficiently particularized one, and the concerns that appellant raised about the utility's compliance with the statutory criteria were purely generalized ones that were theoretically shared by every ratepayer in Vermont. In re Green Mt. Power Corp., 208 Vt. 349, 198 A.3d 36 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appellant was not entitled to intervene in a certificate of public good (CPG) proceeding as a supplier of electric power and a competitor of the utility, as the Court deferred to the Public Utility Commission's interpretation of the rule regarding intervention as of right as applied to a CPG proceeding to require that a substantial interest be one within the scope of the CPG proceeding. In re Green Mt. Power Corp., 208 Vt. 349, 198 A.3d 36 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because appellant did not have any substantial interest in a certificate of public good proceeding under the Public Utility Commission's understanding of the term, it was not eligible to be granted permissive intervention. Thus, if the Commission and its hearing officer failed to give explicit consideration to appellant's request for permissive intervention, this was harmless error. In re Green Mt. Power Corp., 208 Vt. 349, 198 A.3d 36 (2018).

       <p>
        Statute relating to certificates of public good for communications facilities does not call for findings or analysis of the proposed project that are tied to the specific interests of adjoining landowners; rather, the statute requires the Public Service Board to consider a host of enumerated factors relating to aesthetics, historic sites, air and water purity, the natural environment, and the public health and safety, with due consideration to the relevant criteria in referenced statutes. The statute does require that substantial deference be given to the plans and recommendations of municipal legislative bodies and regional planning commissions, but does not require any consideration of the interests of adjoining or neighboring landowners per se. In re New Cingular Wireless PCS, 192 Vt. 20, 54 A.3d 141 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Like certificate of public good proceedings pursuant to a closely analogous statute, the statute pertaining to new gas and electric purchases, proceedings pursuant to the statute relating to certificates of public good for communications facilities relate only to the issues of public good, not to the interests of private landowners who are or may be involved. In re New Cingular Wireless PCS, 192 Vt. 20, 54 A.3d 141 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the statute relating to certificates of public good for communications facilities does provide for notice to adjoining (but not nonadjoining, neighboring) landowners, the statute does not afford adjoining neighbors automatic party status. Rather, an adjoining landowner stands in the same shoes as any member of the public with respect to intervention; the landowner can file an application to intervene, and may be allowed intervention as of right or permissive intervention if the landowner makes the requisite showing. In re New Cingular Wireless PCS, 192 Vt. 20, 54 A.3d 141 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute relating to certificates of public good for communications facilities requires only that, upon filing its petition, the applicant notify the adjoining landowners that it has done so; it need not even provide the adjoining landowners with a final copy of the petition as filed. In re New Cingular Wireless PCS, 192 Vt. 20, 54 A.3d 141 (2012).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Notice requirement of the statute relating to certificates of public good for communications facilities was not sufficiently robust to confer upon adjoining landowners a property right protected under the Fourteenth Amendment; likewise, a grant of permissive intervention was expressly limited to the concerns expressed in the respective motions to intervene, and was granted solely in the discretion of the Public Service Board pursuant to its rules. These factors were not sufficient to support a legitimate claim of entitlement to a particular outcome in the proceeding, as opposed to a unilateral expectation.

       <p>
        In granting a certificate of public good for a telecommunications facility, the Public Service Board properly found that appellants failed to raise a significant issue under the criteria entitling them to a hearing on the merits, as the Board gave due consideration to the project's aesthetic impacts and made findings, supported by the evidence, that the project involved a relatively short tower in a heavily wooded area, that the tower would be minimally visible, and that it would avoid any additional clearing by using an existing access road. Although appellants contended that the Board erred in dismissing as irrelevant the project's aesthetic impact on private parties, it appeared that the Board considered appellants' argument but found that it lacked sufficient weight to raise a significant issue requiring a hearing on the merits.

         1. Refunds.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Legislature has granted the Public Utility Commission the powers of a court of record in the determination and adjudication of all matters over which it is given jurisdiction, including the power to render judgments, make orders and decrees, and enforce the same by any suitable process issuable by courts in the State. The statutory grant of power does include the authority to order the Agency of Natural Resources, as a party to a certificate of public good proceeding, to refund some or all of the fee allocated the Agency. In re Swanton Wind LLC, 209 Vt. 224, 204 A.3d 635 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner, which voluntarily dismissed its petition for a certificate of public good, was incorrect in asserting that the Agency of Natural Resources was entitled to none of the fee because it had not yet presented evidence; however, the Agency could not retain the full fee based on generalized assertions regarding its review. Accordingly, remand to the Public Utility Commission was required so that it could order the Agency to provide an account of its activities in petitioner's proceeding and evidence of the reasonable cost of those activities; after reviewing the Agency's evidence, the Commission could then exercise its discretion to order a refund of that portion of the fee, if any, which the Agency could not reasonably justify retaining.

      Within six months after July 1, 1970, or at such later date as the Public Utility Commission may establish, each company engaged in the distribution of electrical energy in the State shall apply to the Commission for a service territory consisting of the distribution area served by it on July 1, 1970, and any areas not presently served by it or any other electric utility company which it believes it is entitled to serve.
    After consideration of the factors set forth in section 249 of this title, the Commission shall establish the service territory of each company.
    The service territory thus established shall be defined on a map or maps approved by the Commission.
    In the event applications under this section are filed by more than one electric company for an area, the Commission shall, after notice and hearing, determine what part of the area as to which competing claims are filed should be awarded to the respective applicants.
    In the event the distribution facilities of the competing applicants are so intertwined or commingled as to make establishment of exclusive service territories impracticable, the Commission may authorize two or more companies which have filed competing applications to serve the area in conflict, subject to the provisions of section 251 of this title.

        The Public Service Board properly rejected the proposed ruling of an unsuccessful applicant for a franchise to provide cable television service that an applicant awarded a franchise had failed to file a proper application under section 102 of this title, governing petitions for formation of public service corporations, where the successful applicant's petition was submitted on a form provided by the Board, which indicated that the applicant was a proposed corporation seeking a certificate of public good under this section, and where the Board's treatment of the successful applicant's petition as an application for both establishment as a public service corporation and certification constituted an implied ruling on, and rejection of, the unsuccessful applicant's proposed ruling.

        Notice published by Public Service Board with regard to applicant's petition for both establishment as a public service corporation and award of a certificate of public good to provide cable television services under this section was not inadequate under the provisions of section 102 of this title, governing notice of the time, place, and subject of hearings relating to proposed public service corporations, and requiring that the notice state the substance of the applicant's petition, because the notice failed to state expressly that one of the issues to be resolved at the hearing would be whether the proposed incorporation would contribute to the general good of the State since establishment as a public service corporation was sought solely for the purpose of securing a certificate of public good for provision of cable television service, both applications involved identical factual issues, and the notice referred directly to the sections involved.

         Legislature intended that telegraph, telephone, and electric companies should have right to erect and maintain lines in and along any highway without obtaining consent to do so from anyone, provided convenience of public in traveling and repairing of highway are not interfered with and same are not erected in front of or near residence. Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Bullard, 65 Vt. 634, 27 A. 322 (1893); Rugg v. Commercial Union Telegraph Co., 66 Vt. 208, 28 A. 1036, 1930-32 Op. Atty. Gen. 170 (1894).

        <p>
         Statute regarding lines of wires along highways gives utilities a right to locate their transmission facilities either aboveground or below, provided that those facilities do not interfere with repairs or travel. It does not explicitly prohibit municipalities from charging utilities a fee for placing facilities aboveground. City of Burlington v. Fairpoint Communs., 186 Vt. 332, 980 A.2d 226 (2009).
        </p>
        <p>
         City council may not, without running afoul of the statute regarding lines of wires along highways, arbitrarily deny a permit to one utility for activities it has already allowed another utility to do; however, a municipality may determine where and in what manner transmission facilities may be built or maintained under the statute. City of Burlington v. Fairpoint Communs., 186 Vt. 332, 980 A.2d 226 (2009).
        </p>
        <p>
         City of Burlington had the power to impose "undergrounding" costs on a utility under a valid ordinance enacted pursuant to the charter; thus, the charter, which was the most specific legislative enactment governing the question, would be given effect, along with the ordinance promulgated pursuant to the charter. The statutory provisions upon which the utility relied, the statute regarding lines of wires along highways and the statutes governing "Utility Relocations in Connection with Certain Highway Projects," were less specific and, to the extent they could be read as conflicting with the charter, had to yield to it. City of Burlington v. Fairpoint Communs., 186 Vt. 332, 980 A.2d 226 (2009).

         The plain intent of the Legislature in enacting 30 V.S.A.
         ยงยง
         2513-2514 was to allow utilities to continue to provide electric and telecommunications services within railroad rights-of-way even after railroad operations cease. This statutory right is in the nature of an express easement and thus is subject to an increase-in-burden analysis under the common law. Utilities may continue to use the rights-of-way for their intended purposes so long as the uses do not materially increase the burden for which the landowners or their predecessors-in-title have already been compensated. Preseault v. City of Burlington, 180 Vt. 597, 908 A.2d 419 (mem.) (July 11, 2006).
        </p>
        <p>
         City, which had installed fiber-optic cables on existing utility poles located on property owners' land, and the State, which was the successor-in-title to the railroad that held a right-of-way on the owners' property, were properly granted summary judgment on the owners' claim that the installation of fiber-optic cable over a portion of their property, without compensation, violated the Takings Clause of Fifth Amendment because (1) 30 V.S.A.
         ยงยง
         2513-2514 conferred rights in the nature of a common law easement with respect to allowing the placement of utility lines along rights-of-way no longer used for railway services, and the statutory right was construed to mean that the intrusion had to be generally of the type originally contemplated and could not materially burden the landowner beyond what was intended; (2) the District Court applied the correct legal standard to the claim by acknowledging that the owner of an easement could not materially increase the burden of it upon the servient estate, nor impose a new or additional burden thereon; (3) in support of summary judgment, the city and the State submitted evidence that the cable did not affect the owners' view and that the installation was not accompanied by any restriction on any activity; and (4) the owners provided no evidence that any view or activity would be limited or impaired in any significant way beyond the impairment inherent in the preexisting lines. Preseault v. City of Burlington, 464 F.3d 215 (2d Cir. 2006).
        </p>
        <p>
         Court certified to the Vermont Supreme Court the question of whether the City's right, which remained following the abandonment of the railroad easement, were in the nature of a common law easement or limited to maintaining the lines that existed prior to the abandonment. Preseault v. City of Burlington, 412 F.3d 96 (2d Cir. 2004).
        </p>
        <p>
         Although the plaintiffs argued the City's right to maintain existing electric lines did not grant it a right to install a fiber optic cable on existing utility poles, read together, 30 V.S.A.
         ยงยง
         2513(b) and 2515 unequivocally grant the City such a right in this case, regardless of the fact that the utility easement arose as a result of a now defunct railway. Preseault v. City of Burlington, - F. Supp. 2d - (D. Vt. 2004), aff'd, 464 F.3d 215 (2d Cir. Vt. 2006).

         Public Service Board properly held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to rule on a utility's declaratory judgment petition. The statute relied upon by the utility had no necessary application at all to the declaratory judgment it sought, as the utility did not assert, and had never asserted, a right to maintain the power line in its present location by virtue of adverse possession; that section being the only basis recited for the Board's jurisdiction, there was no error in the Board's determination that it had no power to rule on the declaratory judgment petition.

      Whenever the Commission, after a hearing had upon its own motion or upon complaint, finds that a physical connection can reasonably be made between the lines of two or more telephone companies or two or more telegraph companies whose lines can be made to form a continuous line of communication, by the construction and maintenance of suitable connections, for the transfer of messages or conversations, and that public convenience and necessity will be subserved thereby, or finds that two or more telegraph or telephone companies have failed to establish joint rates, tolls, or charges for service by or over their lines, and that joint rates, tolls, or charges ought to be established, the Commission may, by its order, (a) require that the connection be made, except where the purpose of the connection is primarily to secure the transmission of local messages or conversations between points within the same city or town, and that conversations be transmitted and messages transferred over the connection under such rules and regulations as the Commission may establish, and (b) may prescribe through lines and joint rates, tolls, and charges to be made and to be used, observed, and enforced in the future. If the telephone or telegraph companies do not agree upon the division of the joint rates, tolls, or charges established by the Commission over the through lines, the Commission may, after further hearing, establish the division by supplemental order.

    Such sale and distribution shall be subject, however, to such reasonable limitations as to the amount of energy to be furnished a purchaser, and shall in no case be beyond what is reasonably necessary and also as to the distance from the generating plant or from its lines of transmission that such energy shall be delivered, as the Public Utility Commission may determine after hearing had upon due notice thereof given to the parties interested.
    The charges made by a person, company, or corporation for electric energy so sold and distributed, shall be reasonable.
    In case the parties do not agree as to the amount of such charges, the Public Utility Commission, upon hearing had after proper notice to both, shall fix and determine the same, and may, upon like notice and hearing, from time to time, change them; and, fixing and determining such charges, the amount sold and the distance from the generating plant or lines of transmission to the place of delivery, and such other conditions as affect the cost of production, transmission, and value shall be considered.

        Legislature intended by this section to impress a dedication to reasonable public service on those generating electricity by water power and availing themselves of the power to take property and rights by eminent domain, or of the use of public highways for their transmission lines, and to restrict the power of eminent domain and such use of highways to those willing to assume a public service.

        One using a public highway for carrying electrical transmission lines erected for private use prior to enactment of this section was not required by this section to furnish energy to anyone desiring it, unless he or she had already voluntarily dedicated himself or herself to public service in the territory through which such lines passed.

       <p>
        The fact that transmission lines over which a municipal corporation distributes surplus electricity outside its limits cross a highway in one or two places does not bring such corporation within the provisions of this section with respect to such lines, whereby it would be obliged to furnish service to anyone desiring it for certain designated purposes, subject to conditions and limitations imposed by the public service commission [now Board].

      A party to the cause who feels himself or herself aggrieved by the final order or decree of the Commission shall have the right to take the cause to the Supreme Court.
    Such appeal shall be taken and the cause entered in the Supreme Court for the county where the petition and citation were returnable, in the manner and under the law and rules of procedure that govern such appeals from the Superior Court, and the Supreme Court shall have the same power therein that it has over appeals from such Superior Court.
    The Supreme Court, if cause is not shown to the contrary, on motion of either party, shall appoint three disinterested freeholders, residents of the county where the appeal is taken, unless otherwise agreed upon by the parties, to be commissioners, who shall appoint a time and place of hearing the matter set forth in the petition and give at least six days' notice thereof to the parties; and, after hearing the parties, the commissioners shall report in writing the facts found by them and such other findings as the Court may direct.
    Upon the return of the report, either party may object to its acceptance for good cause shown and the Court may set aside the report and order a rehearing; but if the Court accepts and establishes the same, the Court may reverse or affirm the orders or decrees made by the Public Utility Commission, and may remand the cause to the Commission with such mandate as law and equity require; and the Commission shall enter an order or decree in accordance with such mandate.

        The fact that one electric company was presently serving power to a village for its old well site did not preclude another company from being entitled to extend a line, and provide service, to a second and new well where its existing service facilities were nearer to the second well site than those of any other company.

        "Existing service facilities" were to be determined as of the date upon which request for electric service was made, and the right of an electric company with existing service facilities closest to the site to be served to serve that site came into being and was established when another company, to which application had been made for service, recognized that its facilities were not the closest and that it thus was not entitled to supply the service.

    Any person who violates any statute, rule, regulation, or order of the Public Utility Commission relating to safety standards or safety practices applicable to transportation of gas through gas pipeline facilities subject to the jurisdiction of the Public Utility Commission is subject to a civil penalty of not more than $200,000.00 for each violation for each day that the violation persists. However, the maximum civil penalty shall not exceed $2,000,000.00 for any related series of violations.

The amount of the penalty, when finally determined, or the amount agreed upon in compromise, may be deducted from any sums owing by the State to the person charged or may be recovered in a civil action based upon this section.

      1. Purpose.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     This chapter was intended to allow municipalities to fulfill a public need for electric service at economic rates; although a necessary subordinate purpose of this chapter is to allow municipalities to sell surplus power to nonresidents at a profit, the profit motive was not its underlying purpose. In re Ball Mountain Dam Hydroelectric Project, 154 Vt. 189, 576 A.2d 124 (1990).
    </p>
    <p>
     The purpose in enacting this chapter was to fulfill a need for electric service at economic rates, often in communities not served by private enterprise. In re Town of Springfield, 143 Vt. 483, 469 A.2d 375 (1983).
    </p>

     The profit motive was not the underlying purpose in the enactment of this chapter; rather it was to fulfill a public need for electric services at economical rates, often in communities not served by private enterprise.

      2. Establishment
     </b>
     .
    </h5>
    <p>
     The right and power to determine the establishment of a municipal electric utility are granted exclusively to the voters of that municipality, as long as the provisions of this chapter are duly complied with, and the Public Service Board is without jurisdiction either to review or deny such determination. In re Town of Springfield, 143 Vt. 483, 469 A.2d 375 (1983).

      3. Rates.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     Once a town has established a municipal utility pursuant to this chapter, it is subject to determinations of the Public Service Board regarding just and fair rates. In re Town of Springfield, 143 Vt. 483, 469 A.2d 375 (1983).

      4. Procedure.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     In an attempt by the Village of Derby Line to acquire Vermont Electric Cooperative's facilities serving the Village, the doctrine of laches precluded the electric company's motion to dismiss the proceedings relating to the Village's attempt to acquire the electric facilities on procedural grounds, where six years had elapsed between the time the Village voted in favor of acquiring the power plant and the time the electric company filed its motion to dismiss. In re Vermont Electric Cooperative, Inc., 165 Vt. 634, 687 A.2d 883 (mem.) (1994).

The Commission, after proper notice and hearing, shall decide the amount of just compensation and any other matters in dispute, and shall also, when required to fix the price to be paid for such plant and property, determine the amount of damages, if any, caused by the severance of the plant and property proposed to be purchased from the other plant and property of the utility. The Commission shall make its determinations on or before 12 months after the filing of the petition. The Commission may extend the time for determination an additional six months upon agreement of all of the parties or, absent such an agreement, upon a finding by the Commission, after notice and hearing, that such an extension is necessary to prevent injustice to one or more of the parties. From such determinations, there shall be the right of appeal to the Supreme Court on all matters involved as provided in chapter 1 of this title.

      Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, after any part of this chapter takes effect, no municipality operating an electric plant or distribution system, whether under authorization of this chapter or any other general law or special act, shall extend its service lines into any area outside its borders where electric service is otherwise then available, except with the consent of the municipality in which such outside area is located.
    Such consent shall be given only after application therefor to the legislative body of the town or city in which it is sought to extend the lines.
    Such body shall fix a time and place for hearing on such application and post a notice thereof in the office of the clerk of the town or city, as the case may be, at least 30 days before such time fixed for hearing.
    At such hearing or some adjourned session thereof such legislative body shall determine whether such consent is in the public interest, and shall issue or withhold its certificate accordingly.
    However, such legislative body shall not act with reference to the issuance of such certificate contrary to the action, if any, of the legal voters of such municipality, taken at any annual or special meeting thereof duly warned.

        The rate of return allowed a public utility should be reasonably sufficient to assure confidence in the financial soundness of the utility and should be adequate, under efficient and economical management, to maintain and support its credit and enable it to raise the money necessary for the proper discharge of its public duties.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        A rate of return of 5.94% was a reasonable rate of return on capital investments of a municipally owned electric system. In re Burlington Electric Light Dept., 135 Vt. 114, 373 A.2d 514 (1977).

         3. Capital investments.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The Public Service Board, in proceeding for a utility rate increase for municipally owned electric utility, did not err when it allowed a rate of return on equity by treating retained earnings as capital investment, since subsection (a) of this section authorized a reasonable rate of return on capital investments and did not limit generation of a rate of return to pay bonded debt only.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Determination by the Public Service Board of rates to be charged by municipal electric department did not violate provision of subsection (a) of this section requiring the Board to allow municipal utilities a rate of return commensurate with private utilities having corresponding risks where the rate allowed was based on the utility's interest earned ratio rather than on its retained earnings, since the municipal utility did not have the same financial risks as a private utility and the rate allowed was sufficient to assure confidence in the financial soundness of the utility.

       <br/>
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A cooperative that has commenced business may be dissolved in the following manner: The members at a meeting shall approve, by the affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds of the members voting thereon at such meeting, a proposal that the cooperative be dissolved. Upon such approval, a certificate of election to dissolve, hereinafter designated the "certificate," executed under oath and acknowledged on behalf of the cooperative by its president or vice president under its seal, attested by its secretary, and stating: (1) the name of the cooperative; (2) the address of its principal office; and (3) that the members of the cooperative have duly voted that the cooperative be dissolved, shall be filed with the Secretary of State. Upon filing of such certificate by the Secretary of State, the cooperative shall cease to carry on its business except to the extent necessary for the winding up thereof, but its corporate existence shall continue until a certificate of dissolution has been filed by the Secretary of State. The board of directors shall immediately cause notice of the dissolution proceedings to be mailed to each known creditor of and claimant against the cooperative and to be published once a week for two successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the principal office of the cooperative is located. The board of directors shall wind up and settle the affairs of the cooperative, collect sums owing to it, liquidate its property and assets, pay and discharge its debts, obligations, and liabilities, and do all other things required to wind up its business. After paying or discharging or adequately providing for the payment or discharge of all its debts, obligations, and liabilities, the board shall distribute any remaining sums among its members and former members in proportion to the patronage of the respective members or former members during the seven years next preceding the date of the filing of the certificate by the Secretary of State, or if the cooperative has not been in existence for such period, then during the period of its existence prior to such filing. The board of directors shall thereupon authorize the execution of a certificate of dissolution, which shall be executed and acknowledged on behalf of the cooperative by its president or vice president, and its seal shall be affixed thereto and attested by its secretary. The certificate of dissolution shall recite that it is executed pursuant to this chapter and shall state: (1) the name of the cooperative; (2) the address of its principal office; (3) the date on which the certificate of election to dissolve was filed by the Secretary of State; (4) that there are no actions or suits pending against the cooperative; (5) that all debts, obligations, and liabilities of the cooperative have been paid and discharged or that adequate provision has been made therefor; and (6) that the provisions of this chapter relative to dissolution have been duly complied with. The president or vice president executing the certificate of dissolution shall make and annex thereto an affidavit stating that the statements made therein are true.

       For purposes of this section, and subdivisions 4002(6) and 5012(15) of this title, the term "all requirements service" shall mean service pursuant to a contract by which the Vermont Public Power Supply Authority assumes responsibility for power supply arrangements and other arrangements pertaining to the procurement and transmission of electric energy and capacity, on behalf of those systems which are signatories to a contract under this section, and subdivisions 4002(6) and 5012(15) of this title, and such contract may contain provisions consistent with and shall be subject to the provisions of section 5013 of this title in the same manner as a capacity and output contract. Such contract may include provisions under which the Vermont Public Power Supply Authority will provide demand-side management programs and least-cost integrated plans for the contracting utility.
      </li>
      <li id="t30p03c83s4002aol1b">
       Prior to entering into such a contract, the municipal or cooperative utility must obtain:

        <li id="t30p03c83s4002aol1b1">
         Approval, upon petition of the utility or of the Authority, by the Public Utility Commission of the proposed arrangement, which shall be given upon findings that the proposed arrangement will promote the general good of the ratepayers of the utility or utilities, and is consistent with least-cost integrated planning principles. The proposed contract reflecting the arrangement shall be filed with the Commission and the Department at least 45 days prior to its intended execution, and the Department shall make its recommendation as to whether it accepts or does not accept the contract within 30 days of the date on which the proposed contract was filed. Should the Department oppose the contract, or the Commission on its own motion determine that investigation into the contract is appropriate, the Commission shall hear evidence on the matter and shall determine, within seven months of the intended execution date, whether the contract promotes the general good as described in this subdivision. Failure of the Commission to act within seven months shall be deemed to constitute approval of the contract.
        </li>
        <li id="t30p03c83s4002aol1b2">
         Approval of the arrangement, within 90 days of approval or failure to act by the Public Utility Commission under subdivision (1) of this subsection, by a majority of persons voting in a duly warned election called by the cooperative or municipality for the purpose of considering such arrangement.
        </li>

      </li>
      <li id="t30p03c83s4002aol1c">
       Nothing in this section or subdivision 4002(6) of this title shall be construed as precluding entry by municipal or cooperative utilities into letters of intent or other conditional arrangements for ultimate entry into a contract contemplated by this section and subdivision 5012(15) of this title.
      </li>
      <li id="t30p03c83s4002aol1d">
       Any contract under this section shall contain provisions allowing for its termination upon appropriate prior notice, with due consideration for the equitable allocation of obligations incurred pursuant to subdivision 5012(6) of this title during the period of delegated authority. Where a petition signed by not less than five percent of the qualified voters of a municipality or members of a cooperative, requesting termination of the participation of the municipality or cooperative in an all requirements contract, is filed with the clerk of the municipality or the board of directors of the cooperative, the legislative body of the municipality or the board of directors of the cooperative shall provide for a binding vote of the municipality or cooperative in accordance with this subsection within 60 days of filing, at an annual or special meeting duly warned for that purpose.
      </li>
      <li id="t30p03c83s4002aol1e">
       No contract under this section reduces the responsibility of a contracting utility to develop cost-effective demand-side and supply-side resources in accordance with an approved least-cost integrated plan. However, the utility may delegate authority to the Vermont Public Power Supply Authority to prepare, file, and seek approval of least-cost integrated resource plans on behalf of the contracting utility.

    For purposes of these payments in lieu of taxes, the assessors of the taxing authority shall make a valuation and assessment of the property and determine the tax that would be assessable if the property were owned by a utility.
    Payments in lieu of taxes made under this chapter shall be treated in the same manner as taxes for the purposes of all procedural and substantive provisions of law, including appeals, now and hereinafter in effect applicable to assessment and taxation of real and personal property, collection, and abatement of these taxes and the raising of public revenues.

     <p>
      A municipality may by resolution of its legislative body enter into contracts with the Authority for the purchase, sale, exchange, or transmission of electric energy and other services, on such terms and for such period of time as the resolution may provide. A municipality may by resolution of its legislative body enter into a contract with the Authority related to the issuance of bonds and notes as authorized by section 5031 of this title only after an affirmative vote of the qualified voters at any duly warned annual or special meeting held for that purpose. The required vote may either approve a specific contract with the Authority or it may approve generally the right for the municipality to enter into all such contracts with the Authority by resolution of its legislative body. A municipality may appropriate electricity-derived revenues received in any year to make payments due during that year under any contract made by the municipality with the Authority. Nothing in this section shall be construed to repeal any charter provision or law requiring an election or other condition precedent to the establishment of a municipal electric plant.

    1 provides: "It is the intent of the General Assembly to maintain a robust and modern telecommunications network in Vermont by making strategic investments in improved technology for all Vermonters. To achieve that goal, it is the purpose of this act to upgrade the State's telecommunications objectives and reorganize government functions in a manner that results in more coordinated and efficient State programs and policies, and, ultimately, produces operational savings that may be invested in further deployment of broadband and mobile telecommunications services for the benefit of all Vermonters. In addition, it is the intent of the General Assembly to update and provide for a more equitable application of the Universal Service Fund (USF) surcharge. Together, these operational savings and additional USF monies will raise at least $1 million annually, as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(1) $650,000.00 from an increase in the USF charge to a flat two percent;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) $450,000.00 from application of the USF charge to prepaid wireless telecommunications service providers; and
    </p>
    <p>
     "(3) $300,000.00 in operational savings from the transfer and consolidation of State telecommunications functions."

Payments shall be made to Vermont's incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) for the purpose of reducing the cost of providing basic local telecommunications service in areas where that cost would otherwise jeopardize universal service or uniform economic development.

       "(b) Funds distributed under the high-cost program are intended to defray the cost an ILEC incurs in building and maintaining its network so that it stands ready to serve any customer in its service area, even those in the most remote areas of Vermont. In order to achieve this goal, funding shall not be based upon the number of basic telecommunications services ordered, but rather upon the cost to serve any customer in that service area who may request basic local exchange service. This includes the costs of building and maintaining the entire network in each exchange in the applicable service area.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(c) The fiscal agent shall make distributions for the high-cost program to the ILECs, as required by this section. The percentage of funds distributed to each ILEC shall reflect the percentage of total access lines reported by each ILEC in its annual report to the public service board.

Within this category of service locations, priority shall be given first to unserved and then to underserved locations that are part of a plan to achieve universal broadband coverage in a community or communications union district. As used in this section, "unserved" means a location that only has access to broadband capable of speeds of less than 4 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload and "underserved" means a location that only has access to broadband capable of speeds of at least 4 Mbps download and 1 Mbps upload but less than 25 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload.

         1. Plant.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Public Utility Commission properly concluded that two proposed solar electric facilities were a single "plant" because they were not only commonly owned, physically contiguous, and designed to fit together, but their interconnection to the grid required the developer to construct a mile-long line extension at its own expense, the use of which would be shared by the facilities and which the PUC considered to be a single interconnection facility. In re Chelsea Solar LLC, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (Apr. 16, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Definition of "plant" does not address final ownership of equipment and infrastructure; it focuses instead on the use of common - i.e., shared - equipment and infrastructure. In re Chelsea Solar LLC, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (Apr. 16, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutory definition of "plant" does not require exclusive use of common infrastructure for facilities to be considered a single plant. In re Chelsea Solar LLC, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (Apr. 16, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Second sentence of the statutory definition of "plant" makes clear that electrical generation facilities are not independent if they share technical features such as equipment and infrastructure. The logical corollary of the second sentence is that facilities that are not part of the same project and do not share equipment and infrastructure should be considered separate plants. In re Programmatic Changes, 196 Vt. 175, 95 A.3d 999 (Mar. 28, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the plain language of the statutory definition of "plant," two solar power projects would qualify as "independent technical facilities," as they would not share common roads, control facilities, or connections to the electric grid, and each would have a separate interconnection agreement and separate interconnection facilities, which would limit the capacity of each to 2.0 megawatts. As independent plants, both should have been awarded standard-offer contracts under the terms of the request for proposals because they were the lowest and second-lowest priced projects, respectively. In re Programmatic Changes, 196 Vt. 175, 95 A.3d 999 (Mar. 28, 2014).

Such renewable energy pricing programs may include tariffs, standard special contracts, or other arrangements whose purpose is to increase the company's reliance on, or the customer's support of, renewable sources of energy or the type and quantity of renewable energy resources available.

However, if a program is not fully subscribed, any such instruments created or obtained by the unsubscribed portion of the program may be sold or disposed of at no less than market value if the net proceeds of such sale or disposal are used to reduce the cost paid under the renewable pricing program.

    This subdivision establishes a distributed renewable generation category for the RES. This category encourages the use of distributed generation to support the reliability of the State's electric system; reduce line losses; contribute to avoiding or deferring improvements to that system necessitated by transmission or distribution constraints; and diversify the size and type of resources connected to that system. This category requires the use of renewable energy for these purposes to reduce environmental and health impacts from air emissions that would result from using other forms of generation.

       Establishment.
    
    A Standard Offer Program is established. To achieve the goals of section 8001 of this title, the Commission shall issue standard offers for renewable energy plants that meet the eligibility requirements of this section. The Commission shall implement these standard offers by rule, order, or contract and shall appoint a Standard Offer Facilitator to assist in this implementation. For the purpose of this section, the Commission and the Standard Offer Facilitator constitute instrumentalities of the State.
      </li>
      <li id="t30p03c89sub01s8005aol1b">
       Eligibility.
    
    To be eligible for a standard offer under this section, a plant must constitute a qualifying small power production facility under 16 U.S.C. ยง 796(17)(C) and 18 C.F.R. part 292, must not be a net metering system under section 219a of this title, and must be a new standard offer plant. In this section, "new standard offer plant" means a renewable energy plant that is located in Vermont, that has a plant capacity of 2.2 MW or less, and that is commissioned on or after September 30, 2009.
      </li>
      <li id="t30p03c89sub01s8005aol1c">
       Cumulative capacity.
    
    In accordance with this subsection, the Commission shall issue standard offers to new standard offer plants until a cumulative plant capacity amount of 127.5 MW is reached.

       </h5>
       <p>
        It is logical to conclude from the statutory scheme and the language used in the subsection of the Standard Offer Program statute governing provider blocks that are not fully subscribed that the Public Utility Commission is to add the unsubscribed capacity to the annual increase and then allocate twenty percent of the sum to the provider block and eighty percent to the developer block. In re Investigation to Review Avoided Costs, - Vt.
    - , 251 A.3d 525 (Nov. 20, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Having interpreted the standard-offer statute to mandate the reallocation of unsubscribed capacity to the annual increase for the following year and then proceeding along the twenty-eighty-percent line - a practice the Public Utility Commission (PUC) has followed since 2013 - it was reasonable for the PUC to adopt the same approach for the new capacity resulting from terminated contracts. This approach was permitted under the flexible language of the subsection regarding termination; suggested by other provisions in the statutory scheme; and within the PUC's broad statutory authority to implement the standard-offer program. In re Investigation to Review Avoided Costs, - Vt.
    - , 251 A.3d 525 (Nov. 20, 2020).

       <p>
        Because in the statute governing the renewable energy standard offer program, the legislature chose to hinge the choice by the Public Utility Commission (PUC) of a pricing mechanism on a threshold determination that market-based pricing either did or did not comply with federal law, the court had authority to address the federal-compliance issue.

        Statute entitled "Small renewable energy plants; simplified procedures" states that renewable energy plants of 2.2 megawatts (MW) or less are entitled to streamlined approval procedures, and the title suggests that the Legislature considers "small" plants to be those with capacities of less than 2.2 MW. A cluster of plants totaling 4.0 MW therefore could reasonably be defined as "moderate" in size. In re Programmatic Changes, 196 Vt. 175, 95 A.3d 999 (Mar. 28, 2014).

         "Combined heat and power (CHP) facility" means a generator that sequentially produces both electric power and thermal energy from a single source or fuel. In order for a fossil fuel-based CHP system to participate in the clean energy program set out in this section, at least 20 percent of its fuel's total recovered energy must be thermal and at least 13 percent must be electric, the design system efficiency (the sum of full load design thermal output and electric output divided by the heat input) must be at least 65 percent, and it must meet air quality standards established by the Agency of Natural Resources.
        </li>
        <li id="t30p03c89sub02s8015ol1b3">
         "Cost-effective energy efficiency" means those energy efficiency and conservation measures that would qualify as part of a utility's least-cost integrated plan under section 218c of this title or that would be an eligible expenditure under subsection 209(d) of this title.
        </li>
        <li id="t30p03c89sub02s8015ol1b4">
         "Emerging energy-efficient technologies" means technologies that are both precommercial but near commercialization and that have already entered the market but have less than five percent of current market share; that use less energy than existing technologies and practices to produce the same product or otherwise conserve energy and resources, regardless of whether or not they are connected to the grid; and that have additional non-energy benefits such as reduced environmental impact, improved productivity and worker safety, or reduced capital costs.
        </li>
        <li id="t30p03c89sub02s8015ol1b5">
         "Renewable energy" has the meaning established under section 8002 of this title, and shall include the following: solar photovoltaic and solar thermal energy; wind energy; geothermal heat pumps; farm, landfill, and sewer methane recovery; low emission, advanced biomass power, and combined heat and power technologies using biomass fuels such as wood, agricultural or food wastes, energy crops, and organic refuse-derived waste, but not municipal solid waste; advanced biomass heating technologies and technologies using biomass-derived fluid fuels such as biodiesel, bio-oil, and bio-gas.
        </li>
        <li id="t30p03c89sub02s8015ol1b6">
         "Energy storage" means a system that uses mechanical, chemical, or thermal processes to store energy for later use.

       The General Assembly finds that:
       <ol>
        <li id="t30p03c91s8060ol1a1">
         The availability of mobile telecommunications and broadband services is essential for promoting the economic development of the State, the education of its young people and lifelong learning, the delivery of cost-effective health care, the public safety, and the ability of citizens to participate fully in society and civic life.
        </li>
        <li id="t30p03c91s8060ol1a2">
         Private entities have brought mobile telecommunications and broadband services to many households, businesses, and locations in the State. Nevertheless, significant gaps remain in 99 target communities for broadband service, and in community hubs and along the routes which connect them for mobile telecommunications service.
        </li>
        <li id="t30p03c91s8060ol1a3">
         A new level of creative and innovative strategies (including partnerships and collaborations among and between State entities, nonprofit organizations, municipalities, the federal government, and the private sector) is necessary to extend and complete broadband coverage in the State, and to ensure that Vermont maintains a telecommunications infrastructure that allows residents and businesses to compete fairly in the national and global economy.
        </li>
        <li id="t30p03c91s8060ol1a4">
         When such partnerships and collaborations fail to achieve the goal of providing high-quality broadband access and service to all areas and households, or when some areas of the State fall behind significantly in the variety and quality of services readily available in the State, it is necessary for an authority of the State to support and facilitate the construction of infrastructure and access to broadband service through financial and other incentives.
        </li>
        <li id="t30p03c91s8060ol1a5">
         Small broadband enterprises now offering broadband service in Vermont have limited access to financial capital necessary for expansion of broadband service to unserved areas of the State. The General Assembly recognizes these locally based broadband providers for their contributions to date in providing broadband service to unserved areas despite the limitations on their financial resources.
        </li>
        <li id="t30p03c91s8060ol1a6">
         The universal availability of adequate mobile telecommunications and broadband services promotes the general good of the State.
        </li>
        <li id="t30p03c91s8060ol1a7">
         Vermonters should be served by broadband infrastructure that, to the extent practical and cost-effective, uses the best commercially available technology and does not involve widespread installation of technology that becomes outmoded within a short period after installation.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t30p03c91s8060ol1b">
       Therefore, it is the goal of the General Assembly to ensure:
       <ol>
        <li id="t30p03c91s8060ol1b1">
         that all residences and business in all regions of the State have access to affordable broadband services not later than the end of the year 2013, and that this goal be achieved in a manner that, to the extent practical and cost-effective, does not negatively affect the future installation of the best commercially available broadband technology or result in widespread installation of technology that becomes outmoded within a short period after installation;
        </li>
        <li id="t30p03c91s8060ol1b2">
         the universal availability of mobile telecommunication services, including voice and high-speed data along roadways, and near universal availability statewide;
        </li>
        <li id="t30p03c91s8060ol1b3">
         the investment in telecommunications infrastructure in the State that creates or completes the network for service providers to create last-mile connection to the home or business and supports the best available and economically feasible service capabilities;
        </li>
        <li id="t30p03c91s8060ol1b4">
         that telecommunications and broadband infrastructure in all areas of the State is continuously upgraded to reflect the rapid evolution in the capabilities of available mobile telecommunications and broadband technologies, and in the capabilities of mobile telecommunications and broadband services needed by persons, businesses, and institutions in the State;
        </li>
        <li id="t30p03c91s8060ol1b5">
         the most efficient use of both public and private resources through State policies by encouraging the development of open access telecommunications infrastructure that can be shared by multiple service providers.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t30p03c91s8060ol1c">
       The statutory purpose of the exemption for Vermont Telecommunications Authority (VTA) bonds and notes in section 8074 of this title is to lower the cost of borrowing in order to finance the expansion of broadband access across the State.

     Legislative findings and intent.
    </b>
    <cite class="vt-code">2021, No. 71</cite>,
    
     ยง
    
    1 provides: "(a) The General Assembly finds that:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(1) For over a decade, Vermont has pursued many approaches and strategies designed to ensure that every Vermonter has access to reliable, affordable, high-speed broadband.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) In 2018, through Acts and Resolves No. 169, the General Assembly found that broadband is essential for supporting economic and educational opportunities, strengthening health and public safety networks, and reinforcing freedom of expression and democratic, social, and civic engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(3) We further found in Act No. 169 that the lack of a thriving competitive market in Vermont, particularly in isolated locations, disadvantages the ability of consumers and businesses to protect their interests sufficiently, and we recognized that the State may exercise its traditional role in protecting consumers.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(4) In 2019, through Acts and Resolves No. 79, the General Assembly found that despite the FCC's 'light-touch' regulatory approach under Title I of the Communications Act of 1934, rather than 'utility-style' regulation under Title II, existing broadband providers are not providing adequate service to many rural areas where fewer potential customers reduce the profitability necessary to justify network expansion.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(5) Accordingly, reaching the last mile will require a grassroots approach founded on input from and support of local communities. Existing broadband grant programs do not offer the scale to solve this problem, and traditional capital sources typically shy away from businesses with limited revenue history and little equity or collateral.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(6) To this end, public investment in programs and personnel that provide local communities with much-needed resources and technical assistance is required.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(7) In 2020, the COVID-19 public health emergency served as an accelerant to the socioeconomic disparities between the connected and the unconnected in our State. Vermonters who cannot access or cannot afford broadband, many of whom are geographically isolated, face challenges with respect to distance learning; remote working; accessing telehealth services; and accessing government programs and services, including our institutions of democracy, such as the court system.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(8) Indeed, the ongoing public health emergency has highlighted the extent to which robust and resilient broadband networks are critical to our economic future as a whole and provide a foundation for our educational, health care, public health and safety, and democratic institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(9) Broadband infrastructure is critical infrastructure fundamental to accessing other critical services in sectors such as energy, public safety, government, health care, education, and commerce.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(10) The goal of universal broadband needs to be elevated as a top priority of the State to meet the economic, health, safety, educational, and social needs of Vermonters.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(11) While private broadband providers have brought broadband services to many households, businesses, and locations in Vermont, significant gaps remain.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(12) When existing broadband providers fail to achieve the goal of providing reliable, high-quality, universal broadband, it is imperative for the State to support and facilitate the construction of broadband infrastructure through financial and other means.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(13) Communications union districts (CUDs) were created by the State to coordinate and implement creative and innovative solutions in their respective territories, particularly where existing providers are not providing adequate service that meets the needs of their residents and businesses while ensuring public accountability.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(14) CUDs are thus positioned to be the unofficial 'provider of last resort' for broadband and ensure public accountability for serving all Vermonters within their respective service territories. Yet CUDs have limited access to financial capital necessary for expansion of broadband to unserved and underserved areas of the State.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(15) All Vermont electric ratepayers are supporting the rollout of clean energy technologies, however not all ratepayers are able to access those technologies because they do not have access to adequate broadband. Equity in the energy sector requires universal broadband.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(16) The Department of Public Service simultaneously plays a regulatory role in the telecommunications market while also supporting the development of CUDs in an unregulated competitive broadband market.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(17) To ensure universal broadband in Vermont, there is a need for greater coordination of grassroots broadband solutions both among the CUDs themselves and also with respect to their other potential partners, such as electric distribution utilities, nonprofit organizations, the federal government, and private broadband providers.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(18) In addition to broadband access, it is imperative for the State to address the critical issues of broadband affordability and adoption.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(19) The Department of Public Service estimates that 82 percent of Vermont addresses (254,000 locations) lack access to 100 Mbps symmetrical service. The total cost to provide 100 Mbps symmetrical service to each of these locations is approximately $1,000,000,000.00. This figure is based on estimates in the Magellan Advisors' report commissioned by the Department, and it includes estimates of both fixed and variable capital costs for fiber to the premise infrastructure (Feasibility Study of Electric Companies Offering Broadband in Vermont, dated December 31, 2019).
    </p>
    <p>
     "(b) Therefore, this act is intended to protect the public interest by:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(1) ensuring broadband availability to all Vermonters and Vermont addresses;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) ensuring public accountability for maintaining and upgrading critical broadband infrastructure;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(3) increasing the reliability of the electric grid and ensuring equal access to clean energy services among all electric ratepayers;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(4) protecting Vermonters' privacy and unrestricted access to the Internet;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(5) alleviating the inherent tension the Department of Public Service currently experiences as a result of its dual roles as both regulator and community project developer;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(6) directing public resources to the development of public broadband assets intended to provide universal access;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(7) developing favorable taxing, financing, and regulatory mechanisms to support communications union districts; and
    </p>
    <p>
     "(8) providing time-limited leadership for coordinating the buildout of Vermont's communications union districts and their partners and for developing financing mechanisms to fully support that buildout through a newly created State entity, the Vermont Community Broadband Board, designed specifically to effectuate these purposes."

    <p>
     "(1) The use of fossil fuels for heat and power contributes to emissions of greenhouse gases and climate change.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) Fossil fuel prices in recent years have been highly volatile, and significant potential exists for those prices to reach rates that are equal to or greater than the exceptionally high prices seen within the last few years.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(3) Payments for fossil fuels by Vermonters involve the movement of significant sums of money outside the state and the country to pay for heating fuel, draining Vermont's economy.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(4) The state of Vermont seeks to ensure that Vermonters obtain a greater measure of control over the environmental impacts of energy use and energy costs.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(5) The state of Vermont seeks to increase its efforts to limit its emissions of greenhouse gases.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(6) Community energy infrastructure that uses renewable fuels can reduce the environmental impacts of energy use and provide a community with the opportunity to obtain heat and potentially power at stable prices that reduce the economic risks associated with fossil fuels. Local energy purchases recirculate money in the Vermont economy and can provide businesses with competitive energy rates.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(7) The state of Vermont seeks to establish incentives for communities to host energy generation that is renewable and efficiently utilized and that provides heat and potentially power to groups of commercial, industrial, or residential uses, or combinations of such uses, within the community."
