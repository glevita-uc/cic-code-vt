         Legislature has granted the Public Utility Commission the powers of a court of record in the determination and adjudication of all matters over which it is given jurisdiction, including the power to render judgments, make orders and decrees, and enforce the same by any suitable process issuable by courts in the State. The statutory grant of power does include the authority to order the Agency of Natural Resources, as a party to a certificate of public good proceeding, to refund some or all of the fee allocated the Agency.

         Because the Board has all the powers of a trial court in the determination and adjudication of matters over which it has jurisdiction, a motion to disqualify counsel is a matter that rests within the Board's sound discretion, and its ruling will not be disturbed on appeal absent a showing of an abuse of discretion.

         In looking at adequacy of notice, Supreme Court examines whether or not parties were given adequate opportunity to prepare and respond to issues raised in proceeding. In re Twenty-Four Vermont Utilities, 159 Vt. 363, 618 A.2d 1309 (1992).
        </p>
        <p>
         Intervenors in Public Service Board hearing concerning waiver and release provision of electric power agreement were aware that Board had to act by specific date, intended to proceed with evidence as soon as Supreme Court ruled on remand request, and were fully aware of the issues, offering expert testimony on them; as such, reasonable notice requirements were not violated. In re Twenty-Four Vermont Utilities, 159 Vt. 363, 618 A.2d 1309 (1992).
        </p>
        <p>
         Waiver and release provision of electric power agreement between Vermont utilities and Canadian power company was a modification of an earlier agreement amendment; as such, because Public Service Board hearing on that amendment was properly noticed, new twelve-day notice period was not required for additional hearing on waiver and release. In re Twenty-Four Vermont Utilities, 159 Vt. 363, 618 A.2d 1309 (1992).

      <p>
       A party to a cause who feels aggrieved by the final order, judgment, or decree of the Commission may appeal to the Supreme Court. However, the Commission, in its discretion and before final judgment, may permit an appeal to be taken by any party to the Supreme Court for determination of questions of law in such manner as the Supreme Court may by rule provide for appeals before final judgment from a Superior Court. Notwithstanding the provisions of the Vermont Rules of Civil Procedure or the Vermont Rules of Appellate Procedure, neither the time for filing a notice of appeal nor the filing of a notice of appeal, as provided herein, shall operate as a stay of enforcement of an order of the Commission unless the Commission or the Supreme Court grants a stay under the provisions of section 14 of this title.

         Railway company was free to bring suit in federal district court to restrain Public Service Commission from enforcing order as violating federal constitution, although appeal was not taken to state Supreme Court, since law relating to appeal did not attempt to confer legislative authority on court but only provided an alternative and more expeditious way of doing what might be done by bill in equity.

         This section is a measure of the relief available in the Supreme Court on issues properly there, not a jurisdictional statute. In re New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 131 Vt. 310, 305 A.2d 598 (1973).
        </p>
        <p>
         Since this section provides that an order of the Commission shall not be vacated by an appeal, appeals from its orders stand in the Supreme Court like cases there on exceptions, and appeal by one party does not take up the other party's assignments of error. Essex Storage Electric Co. v. Victory Lumber Co., 93 Vt. 437, 108 A. 426 (1919).
        </p>
        <p>
         On appeal from an order of the Commission the Supreme Court is not an appellate Public Service Commission, with all the power of commissioners. Bacon v. Boston & Maine Railroad, 83 Vt. 421, 76 A. 128 (1910).

          2. Stay.
         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         The function of the Supreme Court, or a justice of it, in passing upon a motion for a stay of a Public Service Board order pending appeal, is not to second-guess the Board, but to act in opposition only when the action of the Board cannot be supported. In re New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 145 Vt. 309, 488 A.2d 746 (1985).
        </p>
        <p>
         In considering whether to stay a Public Service Board order pending appeal, the Supreme Court looks at the likelihood of success of the appealing party on the merits, whether the party seeking the stay will suffer irreparable injury if the stay is not granted, whether the issuance of a stay will substantially harm other parties, and the location of the best interests of the public. In re New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 145 Vt. 309, 488 A.2d 746 (1985).
        </p>
        <p>
         Ratepayers would not suffer irreparable injury if a stay of a utility rate increase were not to be granted, since the Public Service Board could insure that the utility, through payments or credits to its customers, repaid all excess revenues it had collected if such measures became necessary. In re New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 145 Vt. 309, 488 A.2d 746 (1985).
        </p>
        <p>
         Since motion involved stay of a Public Service Board order, the primary authority for hearing on the motion was this section's provision calling for a decision on suspension of the order "as justice and equity require," which would be construed to mean that the responsibility for deciding upon the advisability of a stay is principally, as well as initially, in the Board. In re Allied Power & Light Co., 132 Vt. 554, 326 A.2d 160 (1974).
        </p>
        <p>
         The function of the Supreme Court, or a Justice of it, in passing upon a motion for a stay of a Public Service Board order, is not to second-guess the Board, but to act in opposition only when the action of the Board cannot be supported, or in cases where intervening events call into question the advisability of a stay under the changed circumstances, in which case, better practice might dictate that the matter of a stay be remanded to the Board for reconsideration. In re Allied Power & Light Co., 132 Vt. 554, 326 A.2d 160 (1974).
        </p>
        <p>
         Alleged strain on welfare recipients resulting from utility rate increase allowed by Public Service Board was not a factor to be considered by Supreme Court on motion to stay, pending appeal, order allowing the increase. In re Allied Power & Light Co., 132 Vt. 554, 326 A.2d 160 (1974).
        </p>
        <p>
         Grant of injunction by lower court restraining implementation of purchase power and fuel adjustment clause the court had found invalid had the effect of accomplishing a stay of a Public Service Board order allowing the clause and could not stand where there was emphatic legislative policy under this section and section 12 of this title restricting suspension of such orders to the Board, or the Supreme Court or a Justice thereof on appeal. Moore v. Gilbert, 132 Vt. 365, 321 A.2d 13 (1974).

       There is hereby created a fund to be known as the Public Service Reserve Fund for the purpose of providing the financial means for the Public Utility Commission and the Department of Public Service to employ legal counsel, official stenographers, and disinterested competent persons to examine into and testify in any matter involved in a hearing under sections 218, 225, 226, and 227 of this title other than the hearings referred to in sections 20 and 21 of this title. Payments into the Public Service Reserve Fund shall be made as follows: All electric distribution companies, cooperative, municipal, and privately owned, which have been allocated a share of St. Lawrence power by the Department, shall pay into the State Treasury for such reserve on or before September 15, 1961 and September 15, 1962, in addition to the taxes now required by law to be paid, a tax to produce a total of $37,500.00 in the aggregate for each such payment to be paid by each such company in proportion to its purchase of St. Lawrence power, during the calendar years 1959 and 1960. Thereafter, on June 30 of each year, there shall be deducted from the balance in the special fund for the maintenance of the Department's engineering and accounting force and personnel employed by the Commission the tax revenues payable under section 22 of this title in that year, and the balance thus determined shall be transferred from the special fund for the maintenance of the engineering and accounting force to the Public Service Reserve Fund; provided, however, that, if at June 30 of any year the balance in such public service reserve fund shall be in excess of $100,000.00, the amount of such excess shall forthwith be transferred to the General Fund.

         Where the Public Service Board found numerous management deficiencies and statutory violations on the part of a utility, it did not exceed its authority by imposing a return-on-equity penalty in addition to separate statutory fines for the same offenses.

         Establishment of a temporary meteorological tower without obtaining a certificate of public good is a violation of the statute governing temporary siting of meteorological stations; therefore, section (a)(2) of the penalty statute, not section (a)(1), provides the appropriate civil penalty. In re Constr. & Operation of a Meteorological Tower, 210 Vt. 27, 210 A.3d 1230 (2019).

         The only way an applicant could start the streamlined certificate of public good approval process was by filing a registration form with the Public Utility Commission. Here, petitioner stipulated that it had installed at least 134 systems without first filing the appropriate registration forms; by failing to do so, petitioner failed to take advantage of the net-metering approval process and failed to obtain the necessary certificates of public good prior to beginning construction, in violation of the statute that prohibited any corporation from constructing a new electric-generation facility without first obtaining a certificate of public good, and a civil penalty was appropriate.

        § 32. Injunction proceedings.
        <br/>
       </b>
      </h3>
      <p>
       Whenever the Department of Public Service is of the opinion that a company subject to its supervision is failing or omitting or is about to fail or omit to do anything required of it by law or by order of the Commission or is doing anything or permitting anything or is about to do anything or to permit anything to be done contrary to or in violation of law or of any order of the Commission, the Department of Public Service may commence an action or proceeding in the Superior Court for the purpose of having such violations or threatened violations stopped and prevented by injunction. Such action or proceeding shall begin by a petition alleging the violation complained of and praying for appropriate relief by way of injunction.
    It shall thereupon be the duty of the court to specify the time, not exceeding 21 days after service of a copy of the petition, within which the company complained of must answer the petition, and the court may grant a temporary injunction in accordance with the laws of the State and rules in such case made and provided.
    The obtaining of a temporary injunction shall constitute a waiver by the State of its sovereign immunity to pay the person enjoined damages as such person may sustain by reason for such injunction if the court shall eventually decide that the State was not equitably entitled thereto and the State shall be liable to pay to the person enjoined such sums as would be payable by any other person in the premises.
    In case of default in answer, or after answer, the court shall immediately inquire into the facts and circumstances in such manner as the court directs without other or formal pleadings and without respect to any technical requirement.
    Such other persons or corporations as it shall seem to the court necessary or proper to join as parties in order to make its order, judgment, or writs effective may be joined as parties upon application of counsel to the Department.
    The final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall either dismiss the action or proceeding or direct that an injunction be issued as prayed for in the petition or in such modified form as the court may determine will afford appropriate relief.

      <p>
       The General Assembly finds that there is a need for a coordinated public safety message on the normal storage and handling of propane tanks and fuel oil tanks, and for the recovery of propane tanks and fuel oil tanks that are displaced by a natural disaster, such as flooding. The Department of Public Service, the Division of Fire Safety, and the Agency of Natural Resources shall cooperate with relevant municipal, professional, and industry organizations to develop a variety of educational materials for distribution to the public to provide information on any special treatment of propane tanks that might be required in the event of a natural disaster, such as flooding.

Any person certifying shall use this certificate or one substantially like it to certify compliance with RBES. Certification shall be issued by completing and signing a certificate and permanently affixing it to the outside of the heating or cooling equipment, to the electrical service panel located inside the building, or in a visible location in the vicinity of one of these three areas. The certificate shall certify that the residential building has been constructed in compliance with the requirements of the RBES. The person certifying under this subsection shall provide a copy of each certificate to the Department of Public Service and shall assure that a certificate is recorded and indexed in the town land records. A builder may contract with a licensed professional engineer, a licensed architect, or an accredited home energy rating organization to issue certification and to indemnify the builder from any liability to the owner of the residential construction caused by noncompliance with the RBES.

       Revision and interpretation of energy standards.
    
    On or before January 1, 2011, the Commissioner shall complete rulemaking to amend the commercial building energy standards to ensure that commercial building construction must be designed and constructed in a manner that complies with ANSI/ASHRAE/IESNA standard 90.1-2007 or the 2009 edition of the IECC, whichever provides the greatest level of energy savings. At least every three years after January 1, 2011, the Commissioner of Public Service shall amend and update the CBES by means of administrative rules adopted in accordance with 3 V.S.A. chapter 25. The Commissioner shall ensure that appropriate revisions are made promptly after the issuance of updated standards for commercial construction under the IECC or ASHRAE/ANSI/IESNA standard 90.1, whichever provides the greatest level of energy savings. Prior to final adoption of each required revision of the CBES, the Department of Public Service shall convene an Advisory Committee to include one or more mortgage lenders; builders; building designers; architects; civil, mechanical, and electrical engineers; utility representatives; and other persons with experience and expertise, such as consumer advocates and energy conservation experts. The Advisory Committee may provide the Commissioner of Public Service with additional recommendations for revision of the CBES.

        Notice published by Public Service Board with regard to applicant's petition for both establishment as a public service corporation and award of a certificate of public good to provide cable television services under section 503 of this title was not inadequate under this section for failure to state expressly that one of the issues to be resolved at the hearing would be whether the proposed incorporation would contribute to the general good of the State, since establishment as a public service corporation was sought solely for the purpose of securing a certificate of public good for provision of cable television service, both applications involved identical factual issues, and the notice referred directly to the sections involved.

       <p>
        The Legislature has given the right to the Public Service Board to order condemnation when the Board finds that it is necessary in order that the utility may render adequate service to the public, and in electric cases the test for adequacy is to deduct the largest single source of power supply from all other sources which are available and apply the result to the required load.

        In a condemnation case, a utility presented sufficient evidence that the chosen route for the pipeline through a park was the best option when all four alternative routes were inferior to the proposed easement for multiple reasons, including being longer and less linear, causing traffic problems, and causing adverse effects on natural resources and aesthetics. Furthermore, the absence of comparative cost data did not undermine the Public Service Board's conclusions, and while the board might have been mindful of the costs of delay, the court did not read its analysis as relying to any great degree on that factor. In re Vt. Gas Sys., 205 Vt. 509, 174 A.3d 1253 (2017).

       <p>
        Record supported the Public Service Board's finding of the necessity of condemning a corridor on a landowner's property to extend utility lines to the property of a neighbor who intended to build a home there. The Board found that: (1) placing the easement on the landowner's property would cover the shortest distance, involve the least amount of tree clearing and aesthetic impact, and be the least expensive option; (2) the proposed route through the landowner's property would extend an existing and well-established utility corridor that already included a utility pole and lines on the property; (3) in contrast to a proposed alternative that would run the lines along a nearby road, the town did not raise any concerns about placing the line through the existing corridor on the landowner's property; (4) the cleared easement corridor would remain well-screened and not visible from the road; (5) the view from landowner's property would remain largely unaffected; (6) all of the other suggested alternatives, apart from placing the lines underground, would result in the same or greater cost to the neighbor and impact to the environment; and (7) the expense of underground lines could not be justified by any potential benefits to landowner.

        Public Service Board did not substantively stray from the statutory standard in awarding a landowner $250 for the easement taken. In so doing, the Board adopted the hearing officer's conclusions, supported by the record, that the landowner retained access to and use of the underlying real estate and that it was hardly more impacted by the new easement than from preexisting easements; the Board determined that extending the utility easement corridor on landowner's property approximately 115 feet would have virtually no effect on the value of the remaining property in light of the evidence presented. In re Cent. Vt. Pub. Serv. Corp., 187 Vt. 598, 992 A.2d 308 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Testimony upon which the Public Service Board relied in setting compensation was not improperly admitted. The hearing officer did not rely upon the valuation opinion of a witness who was not an expert; moreover, the Board explicitly found that the landowner's objections to the pre-filed testimony of both witnesses was untimely. In re Cent. Vt. Pub. Serv. Corp., 187 Vt. 598, 992 A.2d 308 (mem.) (2010).

     Legislative findings.
    </b>
    <cite class="vt-code">2013, No. 89</cite>,
    
     §
    
    1 provides: "The General Assembly finds that:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(1) The primary driver of climate change in Vermont and elsewhere is the increase of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO
     2
     ) from the burning of fossil fuels. The warming caused by carbon dioxide is amplified multiple times because atmospheric water vapor, another greenhouse gas, increases as temperature increases.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) The primary sources of Vermont's greenhouse gas emissions are the consumption of fossil fuels for transportation fuels and for heating buildings and water (thermal energy). In 2010, CO
     2
     and equivalent emissions from Vermont energy consumption totaled approximately eight million metric tons (MMTCO
     <span class="s2">
      2
     </span>
     ). Of this total, transportation fuel use accounted for approximately 3.5 and nonelectric fuel use by homes and businesses for approximately 2.5.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(3) Another result of high fossil fuel consumption is that the average Vermonter and the Vermont economy are facing a fuel affordability challenge of historic proportions. In 2010, Vermonters paid over $600 million to import fossil fuels for use in their homes, businesses, and other buildings, almost $300 million more than Vermont paid in 2000.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(4) In January 2013, the Department of Public Service submitted the report of its Thermal Energy Task Force (the Task Force). Among other things, the Task Force found that: 'Investing in thermal efficiency improvements . . . can dramatically reduce heating energy use in a building. At current fuel prices, thermal efficiency improvements can bring savings of approximately $1,000.00 per year over the lifetime of the investment . . . .
    As each year passes and investments are not made, cost burdens must be borne by individual Vermonters, businesses and property owners - collectively burdening the Vermont economy as a whole.'
    </p>
    <p>
     "(5) This burden is felt most by Vermonters of limited means or on fixed incomes, such as persons who may be elderly or have disabilities. These Vermonters face the dilemma of being unable to pay for heat as fuel prices rise and federal fuel assistance is reduced. Since 2009, the percentage of an average recipient household's heating costs paid by Vermont's fuel assistance program has dropped precipitously, primarily because of cuts to the federal Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) totaling approximately 40 percent. Benefits have been cut almost in half from a seasonal high of over $1,700.00 to $900.00, and the percentage paid of the average recipient household's bill has dropped from 86 percent to 32 percent. While the State of Vermont has attempted to soften the blow to date, the State's ability to continue to provide fuel assistance funding is limited, and additional LIHEAP cuts may result from the so-called federal 'sequester.'
    </p>
    <p>
     "(6) Many Vermonters who receive financial assistance from the state and federal governments to meet their heating needs live in poorly insulated buildings. The level of expenditure necessary to heat these homes could be significantly decreased if appropriate and cost-effective thermal energy efficiency measures applied. Reducing fuel consumption through weatherization services would decrease the need for supplemental assistance in individual units and allow limited funds to cover a greater number of needy residents. Conversely, as the Task Force found: 'Delaying weatherization for this population places more pressure on other public resources such as the Low-Income Heating Assistance Program (LIHEAP).'
    </p>
    <p>
     "(7) The Task Force found that substantial public investment would be necessary to meet the State's statutory goals for improving the energy fitness of its homes and buildings. At this investment level, the Task Force found that, over the life of the energy efficiency measures, over $1.4 billion would be saved, approximately 800 job-years would be created, and 6.8 million tons of CO would be kept from entering the atmosphere.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(8) Vermont must act to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions and consumption of fossil fuels. The State must encourage the efficient use of energy to heat buildings and water in order to reduce Vermont's carbon footprint and fuel costs and make heating more affordable for all Vermonters."

In order to reflect all of the changes enacted by the Legislature during the 2019 session, the text of Act Nos. 31 and 59 was merged to arrive at a single version of this section, using the codification scheme adopted in Act No. 59 to redesignate as subdiv. (4) the definition of "energy storage facility" enacted as subsec. (b) by Act No. 31, and eliminating the duplicative lead-in language "As used in this chapter" from the beginning of the redesignated subdiv. The specific changes that each of the amendments made are described in the amendment notes set out below.

Such jurisdiction shall be exercised by the Commission and the Department so far as may be necessary to enable them to perform the duties and exercise the powers conferred upon them by law. The Commission and the Department may, when they deem the public good requires, examine the plants, equipment, lines, exchanges, stations, and property of the companies subject to their jurisdiction under this chapter.

       <p>
        In determining whether to grant a certificate of public good (CPG) to a public utility that had formerly been private, the Public Service Board was entitled to consider the past management practices of the utility. The Board's consideration of past acts did not violate any constitutional rights nor constitute retroactive application of 30 V.S.A.
        §
        203(6); any CPG applicant must expect the Board to consider past incidents of mismanagement in making its decision and the utility had no vested property right to conduct a business that could be affected by the Board's denial. In re Quechee Service Co., 166 Vt. 50, 690 A.2d 354 (1996).

        Where it was assumed that municipal corporation in sale of its surplus electric energy outside its limits was not acting as a public utility, but that its relations with its customers were purely contractual, its status was that of purveyor of electric energy by special contract, and its transmission lines and equipment used for that purpose were not dedicated to public use so as to bring it under jurisdiction of Public Service Commission.

           The charge established by the Commission pursuant to this subdivision (3) shall be in an amount determined by the Commission by rule or order that is consistent with the principles of least-cost integrated planning as defined in section 218c of this title. As circumstances and programs evolve, the amount of the charge shall be reviewed for unrealized energy efficiency potential and shall be adjusted as necessary in order to realize all reasonably available, cost-effective energy efficiency savings. In setting the amount of the charge and its allocation, the Commission shall determine an appropriate balance among the following objectives; provided, however, that particular emphasis shall be accorded to the first four of these objectives: reducing the size of future power purchases; reducing the generation of greenhouse gases; limiting the need to upgrade the State's transmission and distribution infrastructure; minimizing the costs of electricity; reducing Vermont's total energy demand, consumption, and expenditures; providing efficiency and conservation as a part of a comprehensive resource supply strategy; providing the opportunity for all Vermonters to participate in efficiency and conservation programs; and targeting efficiency and conservation efforts to locations, markets, or customers where they may provide the greatest value. The Commission, by rule or order, shall establish a process by which a customer who pays an average annual energy efficiency charge under this subdivision (3) of at least $5,000.00 may apply to the Commission to self-administer energy efficiency through the use of an energy savings account which shall contain a percentage of the customer's energy efficiency charge payments as determined by the Commission. The remaining portion of the charge shall be used for systemwide energy benefits. The Commission in its rules or order shall establish criteria for approval of these applications.

        Statute authorizing Public Service Board (PSB) to require that part of costs of operating Vermont Power Exchange (VPX), State's purchasing agent for power delivered by small power producers pursuant to Public Utilities Regulatory Policy Act (PURPA), be borne by regulated electric utilities is not an invalid delegation of legislative functions, as PSB's decision regarding VPX fees is guided by standards set forth in PURPA.

         a uniform mitigation charge imposed for the benefit of the issuer on the consumption of all electricity within the State of Vermont to the extent such electricity is conveyed to consumers by electric utilities, and a requirement that such charge be reflected on ratepayer bills in a manner which clearly reflects both the amount of the charge and the reduction in power costs resulting from the charge;
        </li>
        <li id="t30p01c05sub01s209aol1c3">
         a specific mechanism for automatic adjustment of the mitigation charge, at least annually, in accordance with electricity consumption forecasts prepared by the Rule 4.100 purchasing agent or other entity approved by the Commission, so that the mitigation charge is imposed at all levels designed to provide revenues sufficient to make timely payments of accrued interest and scheduled principal on all mitigation bonds, as well as ongoing administrative expenses, credit enhancement fees, and scheduled overcollateralization amounts with respect to such mitigation bonds. This automatic adjustment may implement a system in which the mitigation charge is initially paid in full by the electric utilities, and uncollectable amounts plus reasonable carrying costs are reimbursed to the utilities as part of the adjustment;

       Approval by the Commission.
    
    The Commission may approve within five years following the effective date of this section a qualified cost mitigation charge order for buydowns or other appropriate modifications, except buyouts, of power purchase arrangements upon finding that such an order will promote the general good within the State of Vermont. To determine that such an order will promote the general good, the Commission shall find that:

        <li id="t30p01c05sub01s209aol1d1">
         significant, quantifiable savings are substantially likely to result from the buydowns and other appropriate modification of purchase power arrangements and the amount of such savings;

Mitigation charges collected by an electric utility shall be remitted by such electric utility to the issuer or its designee within one month after receipt thereof by such electric utility, or such shorter period as shall be designated by the Commission. Upon 30 days' written notice to an electric utility, the issuer or any successor entitled to receive mitigation charges at any time and for any reason may direct that the electric utility shall cease to collect mitigation charges. Any electric utility in possession of mitigation charges shall have no right, title, or interest in such collections, but rather shall hold such collections in trust for the benefit of the issuer.

       Hearing procedure.
    
    A qualified cost mitigation charge order shall be issued only upon hearing, following due notice to all electric utilities, the owners of all participating qualifying facilities, the Department, and the Rule 4.100 purchasing agent. A qualified cost mitigation charge order issued under this section shall involve all of the State's electric utilities, absent a showing of good cause by any such utility as to why the requirements and customer benefits resulting from a qualified cost mitigation charge order should not be applicable to it.

    If the term of any proposed purchase exceeds five years, it shall be subject to the approval of the Commission under section 248 of this title.
    In addition the Department of Public Service may, with the approval of the Commission and the Governor, contract for the resale of the power outside the State of Vermont, if resale outside the State is reasonably incidental to and in furtherance of the needs of the State of Vermont.
    Revenues realized by the Department from such resale outside the State shall be used to defray the costs of such resale, and any revenues in excess of such costs, including interest earned on excess revenues, shall be applied first to reduce the Department's retail rates under section 212a of this title, and thereafter any remaining excess shall be applied to reduce the Department's wholesale rates to Vermont utilities.
    The Department of Public Service, with the approval of the Commission, is authorized and empowered to enter into contracts for the transmission of such energy from the place of purchase to the point or points of resale.
    The Department shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that the contracts it enters into for the transmission, purchase, and wholesale or retail sale of electricity shall be in writing. The Department of Public Service is authorized and empowered to employ additional engineering and legal personnel to assist in the procurement of such energy.

    In addition, the Commission, upon application of the Department of Public Service, may by order direct an electric company engaged in the transmission of electric energy to transmit energy for the Department.
    For the purposes of this section, a company "authorized to engage" means a municipal company authorized under chapter 79 of this title, a cooperative authorized under chapter 81 of this title, or a privately owned company authorized by its articles of association, charter, or bylaws.

    The Commission may prescribe the terms and conditions of the arrangement to be made between the electric companies, including the Department of Public Service, affected by the order, including the compensation or reimbursement reasonably due to any of them, and in the case of a new physical connection the apportionment of costs between or among them, provided that a company making application for a connection which will inure to its sole benefit shall assume the entire cost of the connection.

    In conducting such arbitration, the Commission shall apply the terms and conditions set forth in the agreement or tariff; provided that where a user or prospective user proposes a change in the provision of entitlements to transmission services, it shall bear the burden of proving that the proposed change, including any reduction in or adverse effect upon the transmission services of or entitlements held by any other user, promotes the general good of the State.

    In such cases, any award, order, or decree of the Commission shall, solely for purposes of proceedings subsequent to the issuance of the same, be treated as if it were an order of the Commission acting in a quasi-judicial capacity in a contested case, except that the Commission shall have no power of enforcement.

    Upon findings by the natural gas study commission that (a) the procurement of natural gas for the State of Vermont or parts thereof is economically feasible and could substantially promote the interests of Vermont consumers, domestic and industrial, and (b) that such procurement cannot be obtained by agreement between or among gas transmission or distribution companies within and outside the State, within a reasonable time, not to exceed two years, the Department of Public Service shall be also designated as the agent of the State of Vermont with full powers to act for and represent the State in any negotiations, arrangements, or proceedings for the procurement of natural gas from any source within or outside of the State of Vermont with the right, with the approval of the Governor, to contract for the purchase and transmission of such gas and the resale thereof on a nonprofit basis to the gas transmission or distribution companies, cooperative, municipal, and privately owned, without preference or discrimination, for transmission or distribution within the State.
    With the approval of the Governor, it may enter into contracts for the transmission of natural gas from the place of purchase to a point or points within the State of Vermont.

       When, after opportunity for hearing, the rates, tolls, charges, or schedules are found unjust, unreasonable, insufficient, or unjustly discriminatory, or are found to be preferential or otherwise in violation of a provision of this chapter, the Commission may order and substitute therefor such rates, tolls, charges, or schedules, and make such changes in any regulations, measurements, practices, or acts of such company relating to its service, and may make such order as will compel the furnishing of such adequate service as shall at such hearing be found by it to be just and reasonable.

        The standards of this section call for and expect the application of the expert judgment and expertise of the Public Service Board. In re Continental Telephone Co., 150 Vt. 76, 549 A.2d 639 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section the basis of the Public Service Board's regulatory authority is extremely broad and unconfining with respect to means and methods available to that body to achieve the stated goal of adequate service at just and reasonable rates.

        .
       </h5>
       <p>
        When setting rates for a utility subject to its jurisdiction, Public Service Board is guided by statutory requirement that ratepayers pay just and reasonable rates only. In re Vermont Telephone Co., 169 Vt. 476, 739 A.2d 671 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Public Service Board is required to set rates that are just and reasonable. In re Village of Hardwick Electric Dept., 143 Vt. 437, 466 A.2d 1180 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The duty of the Public Service Board is to set just and reasonable rates. In re Central Vermont Public Service Corp., 141 Vt. 284, 449 A.2d 904 (1982); In re Central Vermont Public Service Corp., 143 Vt. 120, 463 A.2d 525 (1983); In re New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 145 Vt. 309, 488 A.2d 746 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        In fulfilling its responsibility under this section, it is the duty of the Public Service Board to first find that a rate is unjust or unreasonable, and then to make such changes as it finds will make rates just and reasonable. In re Green Mountain Power Corp., 131 Vt. 284, 305 A.2d 571 (1973).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Public Service Board's approval of electric rate redesign was not clearly erroneous, where Board was aware of shortcomings of cost-of-service study and based its decision principally on other evidence, including expert testimony, indicating that occupancy and usage patterns of short-term rental units differed from typical residential dwellings, and that intermittent use billed at residential rate did not contribute proportionately to recovery of fixed costs in electrical plant and equipment. In re Central Vermont Public Service Corp., 167 Vt. 626, 711 A.2d 1158 (mem.) (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        In fixing rates that are just and reasonable, the Public Service Board must balance the interests of the consumer and of the owners of the utility; rates cannot be set so low as to be confiscatory for the utility nor so high as to be excessive for the consumer. In re Village of Hardwick Electric Dept., 143 Vt. 437, 466 A.2d 1180 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fixing of just and reasonable rates involves balancing of investor and consumer interests. In re New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 115 Vt. 494, 66 A.2d 135 (1949).

        This section guarantees a reasonable, nonconfiscatory rate of return for public utilities. Arlington Selectmen v. Arlington Water Co., 136 Vt. 495, 394 A.2d 1130 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public utility company may insist on just and reasonable rate of return and need not, in addition, raise issue of confiscation. City of Newport v. Citizens Utilities Co., 116 Vt. 103, 70 A.2d 590 (1950).

       <p>
        In discharging its duty to set rates that are just and reasonable, the Public Service Board has no authority under this section to make whole either the utility company or its customers for inequities that existed in the past. In re Central Vermont Public Service Corp., 144 Vt. 46, 473 A.2d 1155 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Discrimination in rates may be removed by raising the lower rate, lowering the higher rate, or by equalizing by a combination of both. In re New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 116 Vt. 480, 80 A.2d 671 (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Public Service Commission has no power to cure discrimination in rates by an order which would result in the company operating under unreasonably low and confiscatory rates during the period when the assumed unjustly discriminatory rates were in effect. In re New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 116 Vt. 480, 80 A.2d 671 (1951).

       </h5>
       <p>
        This section gives the Board broad authority over the acts and practices of the utility relating to its services and allows it to make orders intended to induce the utility to furnish adequate service. In re Green Mountain Power Corp., 142 Vt. 373, 455 A.2d 823 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The very breadth of this section's grant of authority to the Public Service Board in the area of rates and service imposes a duty on the Supreme Court, in examining the Board's decisions, to require as part of the order that there be full disclosure of the criteria underlying the decision and the methodology employed to evaluate the facts and integrate them into the result. In re Green Mountain Power Corp., 142 Vt. 373, 455 A.2d 823 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order of the Public Service Board allowing cost of load management equipment to be included in utility's rate base was not improper where the Board found that such equipment was vital to a utility in order to prevent a waste of energy resources, order included a timetable for installation of the equipment, with monthly updates on progress, and the order provided that, in the event the utility did not substantially comply with the order, the Board would not only entertain a motion by the Department of Public Service to remove the load equipment from the rate base, but would also require a refund of all rates paid by the customers based on the presence of the projected cost in the rate base. In re Green Mountain Power Corp., 142 Vt. 373, 455 A.2d 823 (1983).

        To substitute its regulations for those which a utility has previously adopted and filed, the Public Service Board must first find the individual company's regulations to be unjust, unreasonable, insufficient, unjustly discriminatory, or preferential under this section.

         10. Findings.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where in determining the amount of recoupment to be awarded to a public utility the Public Service Board found that the utility's power costs had increased, but rather than exercising its discretion to decide what amount of the increased costs, if any, should be awarded limited the amount it awarded to the amount the utility originally requested as a rate increase and made no findings to indicate that the amount it awarded was just and reasonable, its failure to do so constituted an abuse of discretion. In re Central Vermont Public Service Corp., 143 Vt. 120, 463 A.2d 525 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Service Board's finding, unaccompanied by any factual supporting statements, that in many respects utilities' disconnect practices and procedures were arbitrary, unjust, discriminatory and oppressive, was a conclusory finding covering approximately 180 utilities without examination of the regulations of each and did not comply with rate-making requirements made applicable by reason of fact order promulgating disconnect regulations affected rates. In re Vermont Welfare Rights Organization, 132 Vt. 622, 326 A.2d 828 (1974).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        This section, in effect, guarantees to a public utility company that the rates found by the Public Service Commission to be just and reasonable shall so be in fact and in law under tests applied on judicial review, and, by necessary implication, gives the same guarantee as to the rate of return on which the rates are based.

         13. Special contracts.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Public Service Board's order requiring incumbent local telephone exchange carrier to include shared and common fixed costs in the price floor for services provided in special contracts did not arbitrarily and improperly contradict its precedent by expanding upon the categories of costs that the carrier must include in the price floor. In re New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 172 Vt. 405, 779 A.2d 693 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Service Board's order requiring incumbent local telephone exchange carrier to impute the shared and common fixed costs in its special contracts was consistent with the Board's goal in creating pricing rules to encourage competition because it prevents the carrier from using revenues from monopoly services to subsidize special contracts subject to competition. In re New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 172 Vt. 405, 779 A.2d 693 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Based on its conclusion that services of a local telephone exchange carrier were not special, but simply volume discounts, the Public Service Board did not err in ruling that, as such, they should not be offered in special contracts but should be offered in tariffed volume-based discounts available to all customers to ensure that rates do not unjustly discriminate between similarly situated customers. In re New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 172 Vt. 405, 779 A.2d 693 (2001).

         14. Bottleneck facilities.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Public Service Board did not err in concluding that toll and business exchange services were bottlenecks although they were no longer exclusively provided by incumbent local telephone exchange carrier. In re New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 172 Vt. 405, 779 A.2d 693 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Service Board did not err in its conclusion that incumbent local telephone exchange carrier did not meet its burden of showing that its special access for toll service is no longer a bottleneck, because its decision was consistent with its precedent and its requirements for showing that facilities are no longer bottlenecks. In re New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 172 Vt. 405, 779 A.2d 693 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Service Board did not err in its decision that incumbent local telephone exchange carrier failed to meet its burden of showing that Centrex services are no longer a bottleneck input. In re New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 172 Vt. 405, 779 A.2d 693 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Service Board did not err by imposing a statewide test to determine whether a facility is a bottleneck because; the decision was consistent with precedent; such policy decisions are properly made by the Board; and the Board stated in its decision that "any incumbent, remains, of course, free to request the Board to find that a particular facility is no longer a bottleneck (throughout its service territory or in more narrowly defined geographies)."

       Within a time to be fixed by the Commission, each company subject to the provisions of this chapter shall file with the Department, with separate filings to the Directors for Regulated Utility Planning and Public Advocacy, schedules which shall be open to public inspection, showing all rates, including joint rates, for any service performed or any product furnished by it within the State, and as a part thereof shall file the rules and regulations that in any manner affect the tolls or rates charged or to be charged for any such service or product. Those schedules, or summaries of the schedules approved by the Department, shall be published by the company in two newspapers with general circulation in the State within 15 days after such filing. A change shall not thereafter be made in any such schedules, including schedules of joint rates or in any such rules and regulations, except upon 45 days' notice to the Commission and to the Department of Public Service, and such notice to parties affected by such schedules as the Commission shall direct. The Commission shall consider the Department's recommendation and take action pursuant to sections 226 and 227 of this title before the date on which the changed rate is to become effective. All such changes shall be plainly indicated upon existing schedules, or by filing new schedules in lieu thereof 45 days prior to the time the same are to take effect. Subject only to temporary increases, rates may not thereafter be raised without strictly complying with the notice and filing requirements set forth in this section. In no event may a company amend, supplement, or alter an existing filing or substantially revise the proof in support of such filing in order to increase, decrease, or substantiate a pending rate request, unless, upon opportunity for hearing, the company demonstrates that such a change in filing or proof is necessary for the purpose of providing adequate and efficient service. However, upon application of any company subject to the provisions of this chapter, and with the consent of the Department of Public Service, the Commission may for good cause shown prescribe a shorter time within which such change may be made; but a change which in effect decreases such tolls or rates may be made upon five days' notice to the Commission and the Department of Public Service and such notice to parties affected as the Commission shall direct.
      </li>
      <li id="t30p01c05sub01s225ol1b">
       Immediately upon receipt of notice of a change in a rate schedule filed by a company, the Department shall investigate the justness and reasonableness of that change. Within 30 days of receipt of this notice, the Department shall either report to the Commission the results of its investigations together with its recommendation for acceptance of the change, or it shall notify the Commission and other parties that it opposes the change. If the Department of Public Service reports its acceptance of the change in rates, the Commission may accept the change, or it may on its own motion conduct an investigation into the justness and reasonableness of the change, or it may order the Department to appear before it to justify its recommendation to accept the change. In no event shall a change go into effect without the approval of the Commission, except when a rate change is suspended and temporary or permanent rates are allowed to go into effect pursuant to subsection 226(a) or 227(a) of this title. The Commission shall consider the Department's recommendation and take action pursuant to sections 226 and 227 of this title within 45 days of receipt of notice of a change in a rate schedule. In the event that the Department opposes the change, the Commission shall hear evidence on the matter and make such orders as justice and law require. In any hearing on a change in rates, whether or not opposed by the Department, the Commission may request the appearance of the Attorney General or appoint a member of the Vermont bar to represent the public or the State.

        The fact that subsection (a) of this section allows the Public Service Board to grant utility rate increase without specific prior notice to ratepayers does not deprive ratepayers of due process of law contrary to Fourteenth Amendment guarantees, since due process protections apply strictly only to agency determinations which are adjudicative in nature, and ratemaking proceedings that affect customers of a utility generally are legislative in nature.

        Where appellants did not contend that utility's filings and notices failed to comport with this section, and appellants plainly had notice of proposed rate redesign and opportunity to present evidence, cross-examine witnesses, and file briefs, this was all the process that was due. In re Central Vermont Public Service Corp., 167 Vt. 626, 711 A.2d 1158 (mem.) (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Water company's requested rate increase did not go into effect by default because Public Service Board failed to deny increase 45 days after company had filed its application; for purpose of computing seven-month period within which Board could issue its ruling under section 227(a) of this title, "date that the change otherwise would have gone into effect" was first billing date more than 45 days after filing.

       <p>
        The rates a utility can lawfully charge a consumer are governed by its schedule of tariffs filed in accordance with the provisions of this section, and when the schedule becomes effective, those rates are established as the lawful rate which the utility can charge and which the consumer is required to pay to obtain service. North v. City of Burlington Electric Light Dept., 125 Vt. 240, 214 A.2d 82 (1965).
       </p>

        Promulgation and publication of rates for water service and for electricity constitutes an offer to furnish such services to all eligible persons who may apply therefor; continuing contract is effected when such offer is accepted by any such eligible persons.

        Power company's proposed rate increase could not be dismissed, prior to the time for presentation of evidence by company, for failure to accompany the proposal with sufficient substantiating evidence. In re Green Mountain Power Corp., 139 Vt. 368, 428 A.2d 1134 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where power company filed two separate and different proposed rate increases, the second asking for a rate increase in addition to that asked for by the first, separate rights accrued to the company under each filing and the rights in regard to the first filing could fail for lack of support in the evidence, but Public Service Board had no authority to extinguish them by treating the second filing as a substitute for the first, without support from proof or agreement of the parties.

       Except in the case of municipal companies formed under local charter or under chapter 79 and cooperatives formed under chapter 81 of this title, upon six days' notice to the company affected, the Commission may suspend a rate change until it makes a final determination on the request for a rate change. However, if it shall be made to appear to the satisfaction of the Commission, that the public interest requires a change in rates, charges, or services, or that such change is necessary for the purpose of providing adequate and efficient service or for the preservation of the property of the public service company devoted to public use, the Commission, after public notice and preliminary hearing, shall authorize upon such terms, conditions, or safeguards as it deems proper an immediate reasonable temporary increase in such price pending the final determination of the price to be thereafter charged by any such public service company and the Commission may as a condition of its order allowing such temporary increase, require the petitioning company to file with the Commission a bond running to the Commission members and their successors in office in amount and with sureties approved by the Commission, conditioned that within a reasonable time prescribed by the Commission after the termination of such proceedings, the company shall, with interest, repay to or may credit the account of the persons from whom such changed rates shall be collected all sums collected in excess of the rate in force at the time such changes are filed or of such rate as shall be determined to be just and reasonable.

    Any increase in the rates of a municipality or cooperative shall be implemented by means of an identical percentage increase to each class or division of ratepayers under rate design tariffs previously approved by the Public Utility Commission until such time as the Public Utility Commission shall specifically approve an alteration in such rate design and corresponding tariffs.

The petition shall be filed within 38 days of the date of the notice of rate change that was filed pursuant to section 225 of this title. The Commission may suspend the rates as a result of the petition. The Commission may hold a hearing on the petition.

        Provision of subsec. (a) of this section dealing with temporary rate increases does not require compelling and necessitous circumstances to justify awarding of temporary rate relief; section 227 of this title, authorizing a utility to put proposed rates in place if the Public Service Board fails to make its determination within a specified time, compels an inference that the temporary rate provision is intended to permit the Board to deal with a pressing situation that does not justify allowing the proposed rates to take effect, but justifies some affirmative action before final disposition can assuredly be had.

       <p>
        Subsec. (a) of this section does not require compelling and necessitous circumstances to justify the awarding of temporary rate relief; the logic and language of the subsection, taken in connection with the general regulatory purpose of the legislative scheme, indicate that nothing by way of special standards of need or financially critical circumstances relating to a utility need be demonstrated in order to justify the exercise of the discretionary power of the Board to award temporary rate relief, subject to the overriding constant that the rate be "just and reasonable."

        Public Service Board had authority to grant a second temporary rate increase even though a first temporary rate increase was still in effect. In re Green Mountain Power Corp., 133 Vt. 107, 329 A.2d 372 (1974).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The use of adjectives "immediate," modifying "temporary rate increase," and "preliminary," modifying "hearing," in subsec. (a) of this section indicates that the temporary rate hearing is not by any means intended to require the full and detailed explanation of the supporting and opposing issues related to the usual rate increase.

       <p>
        Since the language of subsec. (a) of this section expresses the imposition of temporary rates as an alternative available to the board to its prohibition of the taking effect of a filed rate change, and it is that prohibition that supports the implementation of filed rates after the time period prescribed in
        §
        227(a) of this title, such implementation is not available where the Board's order provides for temporary rate increases, and a utility may be required to operate under such temporary rates until termination of the proceedings.

If at any time the General Assembly is concerned that such conditions exist, it may, by joint resolution, direct the Commission to conduct a hearing and make a determination thereon. If the Department and the company fail to reach a negotiated agreement within four months of receipt of an order to negotiate from the Commission, the Commission shall hold a hearing to determine the appropriate content of the relevant portions of the contract. In such proceedings, the public contract advocate shall represent the interests of the public and the State, and any interested party may intervene.

        Findings supported conclusions of Public Service Board that telecommunications contract was just and reasonable: price levels were reasonable because they were lower than they would otherwise have been; rate increase as only substantive change supported conclusion that it would promote the general good, and although Board did not explicitly state that contract supported reasonable competition, that conclusion was apparent when reading Board's order in conjunction with prior orders.

        When setting rates for a utility subject to its jurisdiction, Public Service Board is guided by statutory requirement that ratepayers pay just and reasonable rates only. In re Vermont Telephone Co., 169 Vt. 476, 739 A.2d 671 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Water company's requested rate increase did not go into effect by default because Public Service Board failed to deny increase 45 days after company had filed its application; for purpose of computing seven-month period within which Board could issue its ruling under subsection (a) of this section, "date that the change otherwise would have gone into effect" was first billing date more than forty-five days after filing. In re Quechee Water Co., 159 Vt. 122, 615 A.2d 1026 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        In imposing a seven month limit for the Public Service Board to decide cases under this section, the legislature must be deemed to have given the Board sufficient control over matters brought before it to enable such proceedings to be completed within the time prescribed; the Board therefore is not obligated to litigate issues of enormous complexity under circumstances where no probability has been demonstrated that the exploration of those issues will have any effect whatsoever on the outcome of the case.

       <p>
        Section 226 of this title, dealing with temporary rate increases, does not require compelling and necessitous circumstances to justify awarding of temporary rate relief; subsection (a) of this section, authorizing a utility to put proposed rates in place if the Public Service Board fails to make its determination within a specified time, compels an inference that the temporary rate provision is intended to permit the Board to deal with a pressing situation that does not justify allowing the proposed rates to take effect, but justifies some affirmative action before final disposition can assuredly be had. In re Green Mountain Power Corp., 142 Vt. 373, 455 A.2d 823 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Service Board, having ordered that filed rates not go into effect until final determination of the proceedings, did not have authority under
        §
        226(a) of this title to extend by its own order the suspension of those filed rates beyond the time period authorized by subsection (a) of this section. In re New England Telephone & Telegraph Co., 131 Vt. 310, 305 A.2d 598 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the language of
        §
        226(a) of this title authorizing temporary rates expresses the imposition of such rates as an alternative available to the Board to its prohibition of the taking effect of a filed rate change, and it is that prohibition that supports the implementation of filed rates after the time period prescribed in subsection (a) of this section, such implementation is not available where the Board's order provides for temporary rate increases.

        Section 226 of this title, which permits retroactive adjustments in utility rates, by providing that if a temporary rate increase is placed in effect pending final determination of a rate case the utility must refund, with interest, all sums collected in excess of the rate finally determined to be just and reasonable, and this section, providing similar relief to ratepayers when the Public Service Board initiates a rate investigation on its own motion and eventually determines that rates should be reduced, are designed to insure that rate changes that are the subject of a rate case take effect in seasonable time so that neither the utility nor the ratepayers are prejudiced by the delays involved in deciding the case.

        Public Service Board did not err in ordering telephone company to eliminate from its rate base, over a 10-year amortization period, amounts relating to a ratepayer-generated tax account maintained by a predecessor corporation; Board's findings were sufficient to support its conclusion that $1.8 million of amount paid by telephone company to acquire portion of predecessor corporation represented cost-free capital that ratepayers had provided to predecessor, and that this was a cost of acquisition ratepayers should not rightfully bear.

       In addition to the Commission's authority to reduce or suspend any regulatory requirements as part of a contract negotiated under section 226a of this title, the Commission may also suspend or reduce such requirements in a competitive market under this section.
    If, after hearing, the Commission determines that a competitive market exists for the provision of any telecommunications service offered by a company subject to its jurisdiction, the Commission may suspend or reduce any or all of the regulatory requirements otherwise applicable to the provision of such service under subsection 218(a) and sections 225, 226, and 227 of this title.
    In determining whether a competitive market exists, the Commission shall find:
       <ol>
        <li id="t30p01c05sub01s227aol1a1">
         that no competitor offering such service has sufficient market power to set prices for the service; taking into consideration whether competitors to any dominant market provider offer a sufficient quantity of similar or equivalent services, whether there is reasonable ease of entry into the market for providers of these services, and any other relevant indicator of market power;
        </li>
        <li id="t30p01c05sub01s227aol1a2">

         that adequate safeguards exist to assure that any services provided by a competitor which continue to be regulated are not supporting or subsidizing any services offered in the competitive market, and that no company shall allocate revenues from regulated activities to unregulated activities nor allocate costs from unregulated activities to regulated activities and, upon request, shall provide the Commission and the Department with information, including cost studies indicating whether any regulated services are supporting any services which are deregulated; and

         that adequate safeguards exist to ensure that access to any regulated basic exchange services or any other regulated services that must be utilized to provide the competitive service is available at the same rates, terms, and conditions at which they are provided by the company to its own unregulated affiliates or charged to its own unregulated accounts.

       The Commission shall upon petition of the Department, and may upon its own initiative, investigate whether it should reimpose any regulatory requirements which it has suspended or reduced in accordance with subsection (a) of this section; and if the Commission finds that it is in the public interest to reapply any such regulatory provisions, it may do so if it determines that the standards in subsection (a) are no longer met.
    Pending any final order, the Commission may reimpose any regulatory requirements on a preliminary basis as it determines is just and reasonable.
    The Commission shall rule on any request by the Department for a preliminary order within 60 days.
    The Commission shall make a final decision on reimposition of regulatory requirements within seven months of the Department's request or of the date of commencement of its own investigation.

       A person, partnership, unincorporated association, or previously incorporated association that desires to own or operate a business over which the Public Utility Commission has jurisdiction under the provisions of this chapter shall first petition the Commission to determine whether the operation of such business will promote the general good of the State, and shall at that time file a copy of any such petition with the Department. The Department, within 12 days, shall review the petition and file a recommendation regarding the petition in the same manner as is set forth in subsection 225(b) of this title. Such recommendation shall set forth reasons why the petition shall be accepted without hearing or shall request that a hearing on the petition be scheduled. If the Department requests a hearing on the petition, or, if the Commission deems a hearing necessary, it shall appoint a time and place in the county where the proposed corporation is to have its principal office for hearing the petition. At least 12 days before this hearing, notice of the hearing shall be published on the Commission's website and once in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the hearing will occur. The website notice shall be maintained through the date of the hearing. The newspaper notice shall include an Internet address where more information regarding the petition may be viewed. The Director for Public Advocacy shall represent the public at the hearing. If the Commission finds that the operation of such business will promote the general good of the State, it shall give such person, partnership, unincorporated association, or previously incorporated association a certificate of public good specifying the business and territory to be served by such petitioners. For good cause, after opportunity for hearing, the Commission may amend or revoke any certificate awarded under the provisions of this section. If any such certificate is revoked, the person, partnership, unincorporated association, or previously incorporated association shall no longer have authority to conduct any business which is subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission whether or not regulation thereunder has been reduced or suspended, under section 226a or 227a of this title.

        The Public Service Board did not err by granting the purchaser of an electric generation station a certificate of public good where the service territory served by the facility was defined as the entire State of Vermont and the electricity manufactured by the facility was ultimately to be used by ratepayers of electric utilities in Vermont under the power purchase agreement approved by the Board as part of the sale.

        In determining whether to grant a certificate of public good (CPG) to a public utility that had formerly been private, the Board was entitled to consider the past management practices of the utility. The Board's consideration of past acts did not violate any constitutional rights nor constitute retroactive application of 30 V.S.A.
        §
        203(6); any CPG applicant must expect the Board to consider past incidents of mismanagement in making its decision and the utility had no vested property right to conduct a business that could be affected by the Board's denial. In re Quechee Service Co., 166 Vt. 50, 690 A.2d 354 (1996).

If the Commission determines after considering the notice and the said individual, partnership, or unincorporated association's report to the Commission that further inquiry is warranted, it shall order such individual, partnership, or unincorporated association not to issue such evidences of indebtedness under this subsection without the consent of the Commission given after opportunity for hearing, provided, however, that if the Commission does not make such an order within 10 days from the time it receives such notice under this subsection, then the individual, partnership, or unincorporated association may issue such evidences of indebtedness without the consent of the Public Utility Commission, and the Commission shall so notify such individual, partnership, or unincorporated association in writing.

       After consultation with fuel dealers, any appointed efficiency entity, financial institutions, the Commission, representatives of the weatherization program, and other stakeholders, the Department of Public Service shall propose, develop, solicit, and monitor any combination of energy efficiency and conservation programs, measures, and compensation mechanisms to provide fuel efficiency services on a statewide basis for Vermont heating or process fuel consumers. The Department shall select one or more service providers as needed and pursuant to a competitive bidding process to implement those programs, measures, or compensation mechanisms by means of performance-based contracts that are based upon verified savings in energy usage and demand, and other performance targets. The contracts entered into during the first year after March 19, 2008 shall be for a period of time of no greater than three years. Those programs, measures, and compensation mechanisms shall include fuel efficiency services that:
       <ol>
        <li id="t30p01c05sub01s235ol1a1">
         produce whole building and process heat efficiency, regardless of the fuel type used;

       Prior to the Department of Public Service entering a contract with service providers under this section and after such notice and hearings as it may require, the Public Utility Commission shall review the programs, measures, and compensation mechanisms selected by the Department to determine whether these programs, measures, and compensation mechanisms promote the public good. The Commission may alter or impose conditions on any combination of these programs, measures, or compensation mechanisms as it deems necessary to promote the public good. If the Department thereafter changes the programs, measures, or compensation mechanisms, it shall request review under this section by the Commission prior to implementing those changes.

       Funding for the program established under this section shall be provided from the Fuel Efficiency Fund established under section 203a of this title. During fiscal year 2009, any contracts or grants to be made from the Fund for other than administrative purposes shall be subject to appropriation by the General Assembly. The Department shall provide the Joint Fiscal Committee, at the Committee's November 2008 meeting, with a preliminary report on the program to be presented to the Public Utility Commission.

       As used in this section, a "meteorological station" consists of one temporary tower, which may include guy wires, and attached instrumentation to collect and record wind speed, wind direction, and atmospheric conditions.
      </li>
      <li id="t30p01c05sub01s246ol1b">
       The Public Utility Commission shall establish by rule or order standards and procedures governing application for, and issuance or revocation of, a certificate of public good for the temporary installation of one or more meteorological stations under the provisions of section 248 of this title. A meteorological station shall be deemed to promote the public good of the State if it is in compliance with the criteria of this section and the Commission's rules or orders. An applicant for a certificate of public good for a meteorological station shall be exempt from the requirements of subsection 202(f) of this title.
      </li>
      <li id="t30p01c05sub01s246ol1c">
       In developing rules or orders, the Commission:
       <ol>
        <li id="t30p01c05sub01s246ol1c1">
         Shall develop a simple application form and shall require that the applicant first file the application with the Commission and that, within two business days of notification from the Commission that the application is complete, the applicant serve copies of the complete application on the Department of Public Service, the Agency of Natural Resources, the Agency of Transportation, and the municipality in which the meteorological station is proposed to be located.
        </li>
        <li id="t30p01c05sub01s246ol1c2">
         Shall require that if no objections are filed within 30 days of the date of service of the complete application under subdivision (1) of this subsection, and the Commission determines that the applicant has met all of the requirements of section 248 of this title, the certificate of public good shall be issued for a period that the Commission finds reasonable, but in no event for more than five years. Upon request of an applicant, the Commission may renew a certificate of public good. Upon expiration of the certificate, the meteorological station and all associated structures and material shall be removed, and the site shall be restored substantially to its preconstruction condition.
        </li>
        <li id="t30p01c05sub01s246ol1c3">
         May waive the requirements of section 248 of this title that are not applicable to meteorological stations, including criteria that are generally applicable to public service companies as defined in this title. The Commission shall not waive review regarding whether construction will have an undue adverse effect on aesthetics, historic sites, air and water purity, the natural environment, and the public health and safety.
        </li>
        <li id="t30p01c05sub01s246ol1c4">
         Shall seek to simplify the application and review process, as appropriate, in conformance with this section.

       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t30p01c05sub01s246ol1d">
       A proposal for decision shall be issued within five months of when the Commission receives a completed application for a certificate of public good for the temporary installation of one or more meteorological stations under the provisions of section 248 of this title.
      </li>
      <li id="t30p01c05sub01s246ol1e">
       Notwithstanding any contrary provisions of this section, the holder of a certificate of public good for a constructed meteorological station may apply under section 248a of this title or 10 V.S.A. chapter 151 to convert the station to a wireless telecommunications facility, provided the application is filed at least 90 days before the expiration of the certificate for the station. Any such application shall constitute a new application to be reviewed under the facts and circumstances as they exist at the time of the review.

       <p>
        Legislature intended for the statute governing temporary siting of meteorological stations to govern whether and how to obtain a certificate of public good for temporary meteorological towers as an independent statutory scheme, and the statute governing new gas and electric purchases, investments, and facilities does not apply except as incorporated within the statute governing meteorological stations.

         2. Authority of commission.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Application of the "reasonably related" standard in the context of proceedings under the statute governing temporary siting of meteorological stations comports with Public Utility Commission (PUC) precedent and the history of the relationship between it and the statute governing new gas and electric purchases, investments, and facilities. A temporary meteorological tower is within PUC jurisdiction under the statute governing meteorological stations if it is "reasonably related" to construction or establishment of a grid-connected wind generation facility. In re Constr. & Operation of a Meteorological Tower, 210 Vt. 27, 210 A.3d 1230 (2019).

         3. Violations.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Establishment of a temporary meteorological tower without obtaining a certificate of public good is a violation of the statute governing temporary siting of meteorological stations; therefore, section (a)(2) of the penalty statute, not section (a)(1), provides the appropriate civil penalty. In re Constr. & Operation of a Meteorological Tower, 210 Vt. 27, 210 A.3d 1230 (2019).

         4. Particular cases.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Based on appellant's statements, actions, and outward manifestations of intent, including a declaration of planned community in which he stated that he might develop an electrical generation wind farm on his property, his consultations for a proposal to install a meteorological tower on the property, and his stated interest in determining what type of wind was available on the ridgeline for wind turbines, his tower was reasonably related to determining the site's suitability for a grid-connected wind turbine, and thus met the definition of a "temporary meteorological station" and required a certificate of public good prior to its construction. In re Constr. & Operation of a Meteorological Tower, 210 Vt. 27, 210 A.3d 1230 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        To establish that a temporary meteorological tower satisfies the "reasonably related" standard and is within Public Utility Commission jurisdiction under the statute governing temporary siting of meteorological stations, an objective review of the circumstances must demonstrate that the tower was constructed or installed to help determine the site's suitability for a grid-connected wind turbine. Such inquiries will be fact intensive and determined on a case-by-case basis. In re Constr. & Operation of a Meteorological Tower, 210 Vt. 27, 210 A.3d 1230 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        To demonstrate that a temporary meteorological tower was established to help determine a site's suitability for a grid-connected wind turbine, the reviewer may rely on a host of factors, including - but not limited to - the station's size and scope, the project proponent's actions and outward manifestations of intent, the project proponent's statements of subjective intent, the existence of plans for a grid-connected wind turbine, and subsequent development of a grid-connected project.

     </p>
     <p>
      (A) With respect to a plant that constitutes farming pursuant to <cite class="vt-code">10 V.S.A. § 6001(22)(F)</cite>, only for the equipment used to generate electricity from biogas, the equipment used to refine biogas into natural gas, the structures housing such equipment used to generate electricity or refine biogas, and the interconnection to electric and natural gas distribution and transmission systems. The certificate shall not be required for the methane digester, the digester influents and non-gas effluents, the buildings and equipment used to handle such influents and non-gas effluents, or the on-farm use of heat and exhaust produced by the generation of electricity, and these components shall not be subject to jurisdiction under this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      (B) With respect to a plant that does not constitute farming pursuant to <cite class="vt-code">10 V.S.A. § 6001(22)(F)</cite> but which receives feedstock from off-site farms, for all on-site components of the plant, for the transportation of feedstock to the plant from off-site contributing farms, and the transportation of effluent or digestate back to those farms. The certificate shall not regulate any farming activities conducted on the contributing farms that provide feedstock to a plant or use of effluent or digestate returned to the contributing farms from the plant.
     </p>
     <p>
      (2) Notwithstanding <cite class="vt-code">1 V.S.A. § 214</cite> and Commission Rule 5.408, if the Commission issued a certificate to a plant using methane derived from an agricultural operation prior to July 1, 2013, such certificate shall require an amendment only when there is a substantial change, pursuant to Commission Rule 5.408, to the equipment used to generate electricity from biogas, the equipment used to refine biogas into natural gas, the structures housing such equipment used to generate electricity or refine biogas, or the interconnection to electric and natural gas distribution and transmission systems. The Commission's jurisdiction in any future proceedings concerning such a certificate shall be limited pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection.
     </p>
     <p>
      (3) This subsection shall not affect the determination, under section 8005a of this title, of the price for a standard offer to a plant using methane derived from an agricultural operation.
     </p>
     <p>
      (4) As used in this section, "biogas" means a gas resulting from the action of microorganisms on organic material such as manure or food processing waste.
     </p>
     <p>
      (r)
    The Commission may provide that, in any proceeding under subdivision (a)(2)(A) of this section for the construction of a renewable energy plant, a demonstration of compliance with subdivision (b)(2) of this section, relating to establishing need for the plant, shall not be required if all or part of the electricity to be generated by the plant is under contract to one or more Vermont electric distribution companies and if no part of the plant is financed directly or indirectly through investments, other than power contracts, backed by Vermont electricity ratepayers. In this subsection, "plant" and "renewable energy" shall be as defined in section 8002 of this title.
     </p>
     <p>

    This subsection sets minimum setback requirements that shall apply to in-state ground-mounted solar electric generation facilities approved under this section, unless the facility is installed on a canopy constructed on an area primarily used for parking vehicles that is in existence or permitted on the date the application for the facility is filed.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1) The minimum setbacks shall be:
     </p>
     <p>
      (A) from a State or municipal highway, measured from the edge of the traveled way:
     </p>
     <p>
      (B) From each property boundary that is not a State or municipal highway:
     </p>
     <p>
      (2) This subsection does not require a setback for a facility with a plant capacity equal to or less than 15 kW.
     </p>
     <p>
      (3) On review of an application, the Commission may:
     </p>
     <p>
      (A) require a larger setback than this subsection requires;
     </p>
     <p>
      (B) approve an agreement to a smaller setback among the applicant, the municipal legislative body, and each owner of property adjoining the smaller setback; or
     </p>
     <p>
      (C) require a setback for a facility constructed on an area primarily used for parking vehicles, if the application concerns such a facility.
     </p>
     <p>
      (4) In this subsection:
     </p>
     <p>
      (A) "kW" and "plant capacity" shall have the same meaning as in section 8002 of this title.
     </p>
     <p>
      (B) "Setback" means the shortest distance between the nearest portion of a solar panel or support structure for a solar panel, at its point of attachment to the ground, and a property boundary or the edge of a highway's traveled way.
     </p>
     <p>
      (t)
    Notwithstanding any contrary provision of the law, primary agricultural soils as defined in <cite class="vt-code">10 V.S.A. § 6001</cite> located on the site of a solar electric generation facility approved under this section shall remain classified as such soils, and the review of any change in use of the site subsequent to the construction of the facility shall treat the soils as if the facility had never been constructed. Each certificate of public good issued by the Commission for a ground-mounted solar generation facility shall state the contents of this subsection.
     </p>
     <p>
      (u)
      Subsection (u) effective until December 31, 2022; see also subsection (u) effective December 31, 2022 set out below.

     §
    
    1 provided: "The general assembly finds there is a remote possibility that sets of circumstances could occur causing sudden problems with electric power transmission or generating systems or natural gas facilities.
    In addition, there is the possibility a terrorist incident elsewhere could create difficulties with energy distribution within Vermont.
    These situations require a faster process than the required statutory process for obtaining a certificate of public good before commencing work.
    Even when the governor declares a state of emergency because of anything other than an enemy attack on Vermont, existing statutes could seriously slow the repair of electric or natural gas systems in the State.
    This act provides an expedited process to keep these essential systems operating in these emergency situations, while still providing for a subsequent review process to determine the repairs are in the public good."

        Application of the "reasonably related" standard in the context of proceedings under the statute governing temporary siting of meteorological stations comports with Public Utility Commission (PUC) precedent and the history of the relationship between it and the statute governing new gas and electric purchases, investments, and facilities. A temporary meteorological tower is within PUC jurisdiction under the statute governing meteorological stations if it is "reasonably related" to construction or establishment of a grid-connected wind generation facility. In re Constr. & Operation of a Meteorological Tower, 210 Vt. 27, 210 A.3d 1230 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislature intended for the statute governing temporary siting of meteorological stations to govern whether and how to obtain a certificate of public good for temporary meteorological towers as an independent statutory scheme, and the statute governing new gas and electric purchases, investments, and facilities does not apply except as incorporated within the statute governing meteorological stations.

        Federal law did not preempt Public Service Board review of agreement between cogenerator and Vermont Power Exchange for sale of electrical energy generated by proposed cogeneration facility, since such review furthered federal objective of ensuring that rates be just and reasonable to electric consumers and cogenerator had extensive notice that its proposed project would need certificate of public good, which requires clearing Public Service Board review.

       <p>
        Legislature has granted the Public Utility Commission the powers of a court of record in the determination and adjudication of all matters over which it is given jurisdiction, including the power to render judgments, make orders and decrees, and enforce the same by any suitable process issuable by courts in the state. The statutory grant of power does include the authority to order the Agency of Natural Resources, as a party to a certificate of public good proceeding, to refund some or all of the fee allocated the Agency. In re Swanton Wind LLC, 209 Vt. 224, 204 A.3d 635 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not an abuse of discretion for the Public Service Board to dismiss an application for a wind turbine net metering system when the applicant failed to provide evidence that he had taken significant steps to minimize the negative effects that the project would have on the view of a neighbor, and he also failed to present specific evidence supporting his contentions that siting the turbine at alternative locations caused problems and increased costs associated with the project. In re Halnon, 174 Vt. 514, 811 A.2d 161 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Applicant for a wind turbine net metering system failed in his claim that the Public Service Board's denial of his application was inconsistent with its decision in another case because the proposal in that case was for a turbine site in a significantly dissimilar environment, and it was not abuse of discretion for the Board to find the proposal in the instant case offensive or shocking to the average person. In re Halnon, 174 Vt. 514, 811 A.2d 161 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a section 248 proceeding, Public Service Board is engaged in a legislative, policy-making process; a strong presumption of validity is given to orders of the Board. In re Twenty-Four Electric Utilities, 160 Vt. 227, 627 A.2d 355 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        In view of the broad section 248 criteria in optimizing Hydro-Quebec allocations to local utilities, since the amounts involved were relatively small and Public Service Board could rely on the resale requirements in its initial order for future reallocation, allowing an allocation above the optimum was within the Board's discretion based on "non-need" factors including unexpected outages of existing and planned supply resources and uncertainties in the magnitude and availability of nonutility generation, as well as risks in the economy. In re Twenty-Four Electric Utilities, 160 Vt. 227, 627 A.2d 355 (1993).

        The Public Service Board was not required to review the sale of a nuclear power facility under the provision requiring it to weigh the costs and benefits to Vermont of hosting a nuclear power plant that sells most of its power to entities outside Vermont because the claim that the proposed sale meant a change in use of the facility had no support in the Board's unchallenged fact findings. In re Proposed Sale of Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station, 175 Vt. 368, 829 A.2d 1284 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Provision of this section pertaining to the review of purchase and sale agreements of electric generation facilities by the Public Service Board enumerates just two events that trigger its application: (1) "site preparation for" or (2) "construction of" an electric transmission or generation facility; thus, if the facility already exists, the provision applies only if the site preparation or construction is outside the usual course of business and involves new facilities that are neither replacement facilities nor equivalent to those that currently exist. In re Proposed Sale of Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station, 175 Vt. 368, 829 A.2d 1284 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Language of this section pertaining to the review of purchase and sale agreements of electric generation facilities by the Public Service Board evinces no intent to require the owner or operator of an existing electric generation plant to seek such review before changing its sales portfolio or selling its ownership interest. In re Proposed Sale of Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Station, 175 Vt. 368, 829 A.2d 1284 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although allegedly not signed by all requisite utilities, waiver and release provision of electric power agreement between Vermont utilities and Canadian power company was ripe for review by Public Service Board. In re Twenty-Four Vermont Utilities, 159 Vt. 363, 618 A.2d 1309 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even assuming that Public Service Board was statutorily required to review waiver and release provision of electric power agreement between Vermont utilities and Canadian power company, it was not required to reconsider entire agreement, since the Board was not required to amend its prior approval, which was based on the pre-modification agreement, or to reopen the evidence related to the prior approval. In re Twenty-Four Vermont Utilities, 159 Vt. 363, 618 A.2d 1309 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        When deciding whether to approve electric power purchase contracts, the Public Service Board is engaged in a legislative, policy-making process in which it uses its discretion to weigh alternatives presented, utilizing particular expertise and informed judgment. In re Twenty-Four Vermont Utilities, 159 Vt. 339, 618 A.2d 1295 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        The necessity of taking an individual's property or an interest therein is not an issue in a proceeding under this section; the sole issue is the determination of whether or not under the criteria set forth in this section the proposal for which the certificate was sought advances the public interest. Auclair v. Vermont Electric Power Co., 133 Vt. 22, 329 A.2d 641 (1974); Vermont Electric Power Co. v. Bandel, 135 Vt. 141, 375 A.2d 975 (1977).

         4. Factors considered.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Public Utility Commission (PUC) did not violate the statute governing administrative decisions and orders by failing to make a ruling on the applicant's proposed findings regarding the alleged economic benefit of a net-metered solar electric-generation facility and by failing to consider whether the project would promote the general good of the state, as it had found that the project did not satisfy two of the other criteria for a certificate of public good (CPG), and all of the criteria had to be satisfied for a CPG to issue. In re Derby GLC Solar, 211 Vt. 144, 221 A.3d 777 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        "General good of the state" required by one section of the statute regarding certificates of public good is a broader concern than the call for some, albeit possibly limited, positive impact amounting to "an economic benefit" required by another section of the statute. In re Amended Petition of UPC Vt. Wind, LLC, 185 Vt. 296, 969 A.2d 144 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the plain terms of the statute regarding certificates of public good, the Public Service Board need only give "due consideration" to the recommendations of the municipal and regional planning commissions in deciding if a project will not unduly interfere with the orderly development of the region. In re Amended Petition of UPC Vt. Wind, LLC, 185 Vt. 296, 969 A.2d 144 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        In denying a certificate of public good for a wind turbine net metering system, the Public Service Board did not err by relying exclusively on observations made during its site visit, where, besides the site visit, the Board made 60 other findings based on testimony regarding the nature and scale of the turbine and the surrounding area and the project. In re Halnon, 174 Vt. 514, 811 A.2d 161 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        In denying certificate of public good for proposed cogeneration facility, Public Service Board did not commit error in favoring concern for ratepayers over concern for return on utility's investment, where proposed project sought rates higher than those mandated by federal law. In re East Georgia Cogeneration Limited Partnership, 158 Vt. 525, 614 A.2d 799 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Service Board's adoption of rate schedule did not preclude its review of whether proposed cogeneration facility, at requested rates, would provide needed power and economic benefits to State of Vermont. In re East Georgia Cogeneration Limited Partnership, 158 Vt. 525, 614 A.2d 799 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Service Board finding that electric power contract would not adversely effect power system reliability was sufficiently supported by evidence presented, which showed that power and energy under contract could be supplied without new supplier facilities, contract only extended in time current level of power reliably being provided Vermont utilities by supplier, and contract itself provided for substantial compensation in event supplier was unable to meet contract requirements because of termination or modification of licenses or permits. In re Twenty-Four Vermont Utilities, 159 Vt. 339, 618 A.2d 1295 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Service Board could approve electric power contract based on general statewide need for the energy without a showing of specific need for allocation assigned to each utility, and Board could analyze allocations in a separate proceeding. In re Twenty-Four Vermont Utilities, 159 Vt. 339, 618 A.2d 1295 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Service Board is statutorily required to look at the effects of a purchase of imported power on people and the environment outside Vermont only insofar as they directly affect the state of Vermont or its people, environment or economy. In re Twenty-Four Vermont Utilities, 159 Vt. 339, 618 A.2d 1295 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        To approve an electric power agreement, the Public Service Board need not find the contract absolutely reliable; it need only find that the contract will not have an adverse effect on the reliability of the power system. In re Twenty-Four Vermont Utilities, 159 Vt. 339, 618 A.2d 1295 (1992).

       <p>
        Requirement of subdivision (b)(1) of this section that due consideration be given recommendations of municipal and regional planning commissions and municipal legislative bodies before issuance of a certificate of public good at least impliedly postulates that municipal enactments in the specific area are advisory rather than controlling.

         8. Particular cases.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Public Utility Commission did not err in finding that a solar net-metering system would not have an undue adverse effect, as any project-related sound impacts would be temporary, the project would not unduly interfere with the orderly development of the region in that regardless of whether an initial letter of support was signed by a majority, the selectboard and the planning commission had ratified their support for the project, there was evidence supporting the findings as to air pollution, greenhouse gas, wetlands, water supply, soil erosion, and transportation, and a construction staging area was not subject to setbacks. In re Acorn Energy Solar 2, LLC, - Vt.
    - , 251 A.3d 899 (Jan. 15, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Utility Commission did not err in finding that a net-metered solar electric-generation facility would have an adverse economic impact because it would add to an overburdened system, increase costs to ratepayers, and offer no relative benefits such as providing cleaner or more reliable generation. Furthermore, the historical reasons for the curtailment situation in the area were outside the scope of the proceeding. In re Derby GLC Solar, 211 Vt. 144, 221 A.3d 777 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Applicant for a certificate of public good, which argued that the interpretation of the statute governing such certificates by the Public Utility Commission (PUC) conflicted with past agency interpretations of the statute, had not identified any previous PUC decisions to support this contention and therefore failed to meet its burden of showing that the PUC had inconsistently applied the statute. Furthermore, the PUC could consider changed circumstances in assessing whether new applications complied with a Comprehensive Energy Plan. In re Derby GLC Solar, 211 Vt. 144, 221 A.3d 777 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Utility Commission (PUC) had not engaged in improper burden shifting in denying the applicant a certificate of public good. The record showed that the other parties presented evidence to support their position that the project would not advance the goals of the Comprehensive Energy Plan and would cause undue adverse impacts on Vermont utilities and ratepayers; the applicant essentially was arguing that the PUC should have accepted its version of the facts instead. In re Derby GLC Solar, 211 Vt. 144, 221 A.3d 777 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Conclusion by the Public Utility Commission (PUC) that the proposed project would not unduly interfere with orderly development of the region rested on findings that did not support it. The select board's decision not to oppose the project as violating the town plan, on which the PUC heavily relied, did not necessarily mean anything; in fact, the town had taken no position as to the project's overall compliance with the town plan. In re Petition of Apple Hill Solar LLC, 211 Vt. 54, 219 A.3d 1295 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Utility Commission erred in concluding that a project would not have an unduly adverse aesthetic effect, as the record did not support the threshold determination that the town plan did not constitute a clear, written community standard intended to protect aesthetics. The significance of the town's decision not to oppose the project based on the town plan was minimal; counsel's statements did not support a finding of inconsistent application of the town plan standards; and a town planner's testimony did not support the finding of inconsistent application. In re Petition of Apple Hill Solar LLC, 211 Vt. 54, 219 A.3d 1295 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        The only way an applicant could start the streamlined certificate of public good approval process was by filing a registration form with the Public Utility Commission. Here, petitioner stipulated that it had installed at least 134 systems without first filing the appropriate registration forms; by failing to do so, petitioner failed to take advantage of the net-metering approval process and failed to obtain the necessary certificates of public good prior to beginning construction, in violation of the statute that prohibited any corporation from constructing a new electric-generation facility without first obtaining a certificate of public good, and a civil penalty was appropriate. In re Investigation into Solarcity Corp., 210 Vt. 51, 210 A.3d 1255 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to file registration forms for a net-metering system was not a clerical error, but was a substantive violation of the statute that prohibited any corporation from constructing a new electric-generation facility without first obtaining a certificate of public good. Accordingly, the Public Utility Commission did not err in finding a violation regardless of whether petitioner's error was unintentional. In re Investigation into Solarcity Corp., 210 Vt. 51, 210 A.3d 1255 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        With regard to a certificate of public good for a solar electric generation facility, there was support, including an independent analysis by the Vermont Division for Historic Preservation, for the Public Service Board's finding that the project would not have an undue adverse impact on historic sites. In re Petition of Rutland Renewable Energy, LLC, 202 Vt. 59, 147 A.3d 621 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        In granting a certificate of public good for a solar electric generation facility, the Public Service Board properly found that the project would not have an undue adverse impact on aesthetics, as setback requirements in the municipal plan and could not be considered a community standard because they would allow the town rather than the State to control solar generation and did not identify specific areas or resources for protection, the Board considered the neighbors' perspective and required extensive screening to mitigate that impact, and the neighbors did not offer a fully formed proposal for an alternative setback requirement. In re Petition of Rutland Renewable Energy, LLC, 202 Vt. 59, 147 A.3d 621 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        In granting a certificate of public good for a solar electric generation facility, the Public Service Board properly found the assertion of regional impact inadequate and not persuasive, as there was no actual evidence of regional impact aside from a prediction of future replication. In re Petition of Rutland Renewable Energy, LLC, 202 Vt. 59, 147 A.3d 621 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        In awarding a certificate of public good to construct a wind-electric generation facility, the Public Service Board properly found that the project complied with noise standards to protect public health. The Board imposed absolute noise standards and required the implementation of a comprehensive noise-monitoring plan; its operating conditions effectively ensured that the project would comply with the Board's sound standard, regardless of the precise accuracy of the noise-level estimates in the testimony. In re Joint Petition of Green Mountain Power Corp., 192 Vt. 429, 60 A.3d 654 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        In awarding a certificate of public good to construct a wind-electric generation facility, the Public Service Board acted well within its discretion in classifying a certain restriction as a technical error. It was readily apparent from the Board's order that it approved up to a twenty-one turbine wind-generation facility and that it expressly approved a particular turbine model. In re Joint Petition of Green Mountain Power Corp., 192 Vt. 429, 60 A.3d 654 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        With regard to an application for a certificate of public good to construct a wind-electric generation facility, the record supported the Public Service Board's finding that mitigation and decommissioning measures would limit the impacts of clearing to being adverse in nature, rather than unduly adverse. While it was true that at the time of his prefiled testimony, a witness believed that the impacts to these forests would be unduly adverse, he stated in his live testimony that the project's effects on the two state-significant forest types had been mitigated such that they were adverse but not unduly so. In re Joint Petition of Green Mountain Power Corp., 192 Vt. 429, 60 A.3d 654 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Towns failed to meet their burden of demonstrating that the Public Service Board violated their constitutional right to due process by not holding an evidentiary hearing on whether a utility's efforts were sufficient to address the damage caused to easement parcels. The Board informed the parties in advance of the process to be followed, and it would create substantial procedural expense for the parties and for the Board to hold a full-blown technical hearing every time there was a post-certification claim that any number of conditions had not been complied with. In re Joint Petition of Green Mountain Power Corp., 192 Vt. 429, 60 A.3d 654 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether a condition to granting a certificate of public good had been satisfied, the Public Service Board did not err in finding that remediation and mitigation were sufficient to counter the otherwise undue adverse impacts to the natural environment posed by the project. The Board concluded that a utility remediated the tree cutting activities on the original easement parcels to the fullest extent possible, and further that the additional conservation easements obtained as supplemental mitigation - when combined with the original easements subject to additional restrictions - would provide a greater degree of wildlife protection than the original easements alone. In re Joint Petition of Green Mountain Power Corp., 192 Vt. 429, 60 A.3d 654 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Service Board properly denied towns' motion to revoke a certificate of public good (CPG). The Board did not make the commencement of construction by a certain date a condition of the CPG, nor did it condition the CPG on a utility obtaining tax credits. In re Joint Petition of Green Mountain Power Corp., 192 Vt. 429, 60 A.3d 654 (2012).

       <p>
        Public Service Board properly found that a solar energy farm would not have an "undue adverse effect" on aesthetics. The record, including testimony by a land-use planner about the project's visibility and its consistency with town and county plans, supported its decision. In re Petition of Cross Pollination, 191 Vt. 631, 47 A.3d 1285 (mem.) (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Service Board's determination that the general good would not be promoted unless approval of a project was conditioned upon the requirement that the applicant make further efforts to enter into stably priced contracts with Vermont utilities did not detract from its explicit finding that the project demonstrated economic benefits. The promotion of the general good of the State can plainly encompass the potential for even greater economic benefit from taking advantage of a particular efficiency, such as a sustainable no-cost fuel source, as envisioned by the Board's decision. In re Amended Petition of UPC Vt. Wind, LLC, 185 Vt. 296, 969 A.2d 144 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Given a project's not insignificant impacts, it was fully within the Public Service Board's purview to condition approval on the applicant making further efforts to exploit its advantage to reach stably priced contracts for the sale of electricity insulated from market fluctuations so as to enhance the project's benefit to the utility ratepayers at large. In imposing this requirement, the Board did not ignore a substantive issue mandated by statute for consideration; instead, it fulfilled its statutory mandate, finding that the project, with conditions, satisfied the applicable statutory requirements, provided benefits greater than its adverse impacts, and, accordingly, promoted the general good of the state. In re Amended Petition of UPC Vt. Wind, LLC, 185 Vt. 296, 969 A.2d 144 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public Service Board did not err in finding that a project would not unduly interfere with the orderly development of the region. The Board acknowledged that the project was inconsistent with some provisions in the regional plan, but found that the plan did not prohibit the project and, in fact, that it encouraged development of wind power; the plan did not prohibit the development of commercial-scale wind energy; and it was not unreasonable for the Board to find that the project would affect only a small portion of the land designated as rural under the regional plan. In re Amended Petition of UPC Vt. Wind, LLC, 185 Vt. 296, 969 A.2d 144 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is elemental that each case turns on its own facts, and determining the degree of adverse aesthetic effect is a matter of weighing the evidence, a role for the Public Service Board rather than for the court. Because the Board applied the appropriate standard in evaluating the aesthetic impact of a project, its conclusion was supported by its findings, and its findings were supported by the record, the court would not disturb the Board's assessment of the weight of the evidence on appeal. In re Amended Petition of UPC Vt. Wind, LLC, 185 Vt. 296, 969 A.2d 144 (2009).

       <p>
        Public Utility Commission properly granted permissive intervention to a homeowners' association and a country club on the ground that they articulated potential aesthetic injuries that fell within the scope of the interests protected by the statute governing certificates of public good and that were uniquely felt by them, as they raised concerns resulting from increased noise and wind and the effect on their views.

        Appellant was not entitled to intervene in a certificate of public good (CPG) proceeding as a supplier of electric power and a competitor of the utility, as the Court deferred to the Public Utility Commission's interpretation of the rule regarding intervention as of right as applied to a CPG proceeding to require that a substantial interest be one within the scope of the CPG proceeding. In re Green Mt. Power Corp., 208 Vt. 349, 198 A.3d 36 (2018).

        Because appellant did not have any substantial interest in a certificate of public good proceeding under the Public Utility Commission's understanding of the term, it was not eligible to be granted permissive intervention. Thus, if the Commission and its hearing officer failed to give explicit consideration to appellant's request for permissive intervention, this was harmless error. In re Green Mt. Power Corp., 208 Vt. 349, 198 A.3d 36 (2018).

       Certificate.
    
    Notwithstanding any other provision of law, if the applicant seeks approval for the construction or installation of telecommunications facilities that are to be interconnected with other telecommunications facilities proposed or already in existence, the applicant may obtain a certificate of public good issued by the Public Utility Commission under this section, which the Commission may grant if it finds that the facilities will promote the general good of the State consistent with subsection 202c(b) of this title. A single application may seek approval of one or more telecommunications facilities. An application under this section shall include a copy of each other State and local permit, certificate, or approval that has been issued for the facility under a statute, ordinance, or bylaw pertaining to the environment or land use.

       Findings.
    
    Before the Public Utility Commission issues a certificate of public good under this section, it shall find that:
       <ol>
        <li id="t30p01c05sub01s248aol1c1">
         The proposed facility will not have an undue adverse effect on aesthetics, historic sites, air and water purity, the natural environment, and the public health and safety, and the public's use and enjoyment of the I-89 and I-91 scenic corridors or of any highway that has been designated as a scenic road pursuant to <cite class="vt-code">19 V.S.A. § 2501</cite> or a scenic byway pursuant to 23 U.S.C. § 162, with due consideration having been given to the relevant criteria specified in <cite class="vt-code">10 V.S.A. §§ 1424a(d)</cite> and 6086(a)(1) through (8) and (9)(K). However, with respect to telecommunications facilities of limited size and scope, the Commission shall waive all criteria of this subdivision other than <cite class="vt-code">10 V.S.A. § 6086(a)(1)(D)</cite> (floodways) and (a)(8) (aesthetics, scenic beauty, historic sites, rare and irreplaceable natural areas; endangered species; necessary wildlife habitat).

           the Commission may determine, pursuant to the procedures described in subdivision (j)(2)(A) of this section, that a petition raises a significant issue with respect to any criterion of this subdivision; and

          <li id="t30p01c05sub01s248aol1c1B">
           a telecommunications facility of limited size and scope shall comply, at a minimum, with the requirements of the Low Risk Site Handbook for Erosion Prevention and Sediment Control issued by the Department of Environmental Conservation, regardless of any provisions in that handbook that limit its applicability.

        <li id="t30p01c05sub01s248aol1c2">
         Unless there is good cause to find otherwise, substantial deference has been given to the plans of the affected municipalities; to the recommendations of the municipal legislative bodies and the municipal planning commissions regarding the municipal plans; and to the recommendations of the regional planning commission concerning the regional plan. Nothing in this section or other provision of law shall prevent a municipal body from basing its recommendations to which substantial deference is required under this subdivision (2) on an ordinance adopted under <cite class="vt-code">24 V.S.A. § 2291(19)</cite> or bylaw adopted under 24 V.S.A. chapter 117 by the municipality in which the facility is located. A rebuttable presumption respecting compliance with the applicable plan shall be created by a letter from an affected municipal legislative body or municipal planning commission concerning compliance with the municipal plan and by a letter from a regional planning commission concerning compliance with the regional plan.

    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, when the Governor has declared a state of emergency pursuant to <cite class="vt-code">20 V.S.A. § 9</cite> and for 180 days after the declared state of emergency ends, the Commission may waive, for a specified and limited time, the prohibitions contained in this section upon site preparation for or construction of a temporary telecommunications facility necessary for maintaining or improving access to telecommunications services. Waivers issued under this subsection shall be valid for a period not to exceed the duration of the declared emergency plus 180 days.

       <p>
        Statute relating to certificates of public good for communications facilities does not call for findings or analysis of the proposed project that are tied to the specific interests of adjoining landowners; rather, the statute requires the Public Service Board to consider a host of enumerated factors relating to aesthetics, historic sites, air and water purity, the natural environment, and the public health and safety, with due consideration to the relevant criteria in referenced statutes. The statute does require that substantial deference be given to the plans and recommendations of municipal legislative bodies and regional planning commissions, but does not require any consideration of the interests of adjoining or neighboring landowners per se. In re New Cingular Wireless PCS, 192 Vt. 20, 54 A.3d 141 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Like certificate of public good proceedings pursuant to a closely analogous statute, the statute pertaining to new gas and electric purchases, proceedings pursuant to the statute relating to certificates of public good for communications facilities relate only to the issues of public good, not to the interests of private landowners who are or may be involved. In re New Cingular Wireless PCS, 192 Vt. 20, 54 A.3d 141 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the statute relating to certificates of public good for communications facilities does provide for notice to adjoining (but not nonadjoining, neighboring) landowners, the statute does not afford adjoining neighbors automatic party status. Rather, an adjoining landowner stands in the same shoes as any member of the public with respect to intervention; the landowner can file an application to intervene, and may be allowed intervention as of right or permissive intervention if the landowner makes the requisite showing. In re New Cingular Wireless PCS, 192 Vt. 20, 54 A.3d 141 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute relating to certificates of public good for communications facilities requires only that, upon filing its petition, the applicant notify the adjoining landowners that it has done so; it need not even provide the adjoining landowners with a final copy of the petition as filed. In re New Cingular Wireless PCS, 192 Vt. 20, 54 A.3d 141 (2012).

         2. Constitutional issues.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Notice requirement of the statute relating to certificates of public good for communications facilities was not sufficiently robust to confer upon adjoining landowners a property right protected under the Fourteenth Amendment; likewise, a grant of permissive intervention was expressly limited to the concerns expressed in the respective motions to intervene, and was granted solely in the discretion of the Public Service Board pursuant to its rules. These factors were not sufficient to support a legitimate claim of entitlement to a particular outcome in the proceeding, as opposed to a unilateral expectation. In re New Cingular Wireless PCS, 192 Vt. 20, 54 A.3d 141 (2012).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In granting a certificate of public good for a telecommunications facility, the Public Service Board properly found that appellants failed to raise a significant issue under the criteria entitling them to a hearing on the merits, as the Board gave due consideration to the project's aesthetic impacts and made findings, supported by the evidence, that the project involved a relatively short tower in a heavily wooded area, that the tower would be minimally visible, and that it would avoid any additional clearing by using an existing access road. Although appellants contended that the Board erred in dismissing as irrelevant the project's aesthetic impact on private parties, it appeared that the Board considered appellants' argument but found that it lacked sufficient weight to raise a significant issue requiring a hearing on the merits. In re Petition of VTel Wireless, Inc., 201 Vt. 1, 134 A.3d 1227 (2015).

         1. Refunds.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Legislature has granted the Public Utility Commission the powers of a court of record in the determination and adjudication of all matters over which it is given jurisdiction, including the power to render judgments, make orders and decrees, and enforce the same by any suitable process issuable by courts in the State. The statutory grant of power does include the authority to order the Agency of Natural Resources, as a party to a certificate of public good proceeding, to refund some or all of the fee allocated the Agency. In re Swanton Wind LLC, 209 Vt. 224, 204 A.3d 635 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner, which voluntarily dismissed its petition for a certificate of public good, was incorrect in asserting that the Agency of Natural Resources was entitled to none of the fee because it had not yet presented evidence; however, the Agency could not retain the full fee based on generalized assertions regarding its review. Accordingly, remand to the Public Utility Commission was required so that it could order the Agency to provide an account of its activities in petitioner's proceeding and evidence of the reasonable cost of those activities; after reviewing the Agency's evidence, the Commission could then exercise its discretion to order a refund of that portion of the fee, if any, which the Agency could not reasonably justify retaining. In re Swanton Wind LLC, 209 Vt. 224, 204 A.3d 635 (2018).

     <p>
      The Public Utility Commission shall ascertain and establish the natural maximum and minimum water levels of Lake Seymour at the outlet, excluding from its determination of such levels the effect on natural conditions disturbed by blasting of the barrier, changes in the depth and width of the channel above and below the barrier, as well as the effect the present control dam may have on such levels.
    When such levels are so established, the Commission shall certify its findings to the Secretary of State and cause the same to be recorded in the offices of the town clerks of the towns of Morgan and Charleston.

        The Public Service Board properly rejected the proposed ruling of an unsuccessful applicant for a franchise to provide cable television service that an applicant awarded a franchise had failed to file a proper application under section 102 of this title, governing petitions for formation of public service corporations, where the successful applicant's petition was submitted on a form provided by the Board, which indicated that the applicant was a proposed corporation seeking a certificate of public good under this section, and where the Board's treatment of the successful applicant's petition as an application for both establishment as a public service corporation and certification constituted an implied ruling on, and rejection of, the unsuccessful applicant's proposed ruling.

        Notice published by Public Service Board with regard to applicant's petition for both establishment as a public service corporation and award of a certificate of public good to provide cable television services under this section was not inadequate under the provisions of section 102 of this title, governing notice of the time, place, and subject of hearings relating to proposed public service corporations, and requiring that the notice state the substance of the applicant's petition, because the notice failed to state expressly that one of the issues to be resolved at the hearing would be whether the proposed incorporation would contribute to the general good of the State since establishment as a public service corporation was sought solely for the purpose of securing a certificate of public good for provision of cable television service, both applications involved identical factual issues, and the notice referred directly to the sections involved.

         Legislature intended that telegraph, telephone, and electric companies should have right to erect and maintain lines in and along any highway without obtaining consent to do so from anyone, provided convenience of public in traveling and repairing of highway are not interfered with and same are not erected in front of or near residence. Western Union Telegraph Co. v. Bullard, 65 Vt. 634, 27 A. 322 (1893); Rugg v. Commercial Union Telegraph Co., 66 Vt. 208, 28 A. 1036, 1930-32 Op. Atty. Gen. 170 (1894).

         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         Statute regarding lines of wires along highways gives utilities a right to locate their transmission facilities either aboveground or below, provided that those facilities do not interfere with repairs or travel. It does not explicitly prohibit municipalities from charging utilities a fee for placing facilities aboveground. City of Burlington v. Fairpoint Communs., 186 Vt. 332, 980 A.2d 226 (2009).
        </p>
        <p>
         City council may not, without running afoul of the statute regarding lines of wires along highways, arbitrarily deny a permit to one utility for activities it has already allowed another utility to do; however, a municipality may determine where and in what manner transmission facilities may be built or maintained under the statute. City of Burlington v. Fairpoint Communs., 186 Vt. 332, 980 A.2d 226 (2009).
        </p>
        <p>
         City of Burlington had the power to impose "undergrounding" costs on a utility under a valid ordinance enacted pursuant to the charter; thus, the charter, which was the most specific legislative enactment governing the question, would be given effect, along with the ordinance promulgated pursuant to the charter. The statutory provisions upon which the utility relied, the statute regarding lines of wires along highways and the statutes governing "Utility Relocations in Connection with Certain Highway Projects," were less specific and, to the extent they could be read as conflicting with the charter, had to yield to it. City of Burlington v. Fairpoint Communs., 186 Vt. 332, 980 A.2d 226 (2009).

        <p>
         The plain intent of the Legislature in enacting 30 V.S.A.
         §§
         2513-2514 was to allow utilities to continue to provide electric and telecommunications services within railroad rights-of-way even after railroad operations cease. This statutory right is in the nature of an express easement and thus is subject to an increase-in-burden analysis under the common law. Utilities may continue to use the rights-of-way for their intended purposes so long as the uses do not materially increase the burden for which the landowners or their predecessors-in-title have already been compensated. Preseault v. City of Burlington, 180 Vt. 597, 908 A.2d 419 (mem.) (July 11, 2006).
        </p>
        <p>
         City, which had installed fiber-optic cables on existing utility poles located on property owners' land, and the State, which was the successor-in-title to the railroad that held a right-of-way on the owners' property, were properly granted summary judgment on the owners' claim that the installation of fiber-optic cable over a portion of their property, without compensation, violated the Takings Clause of Fifth Amendment because (1) 30 V.S.A.
         §§
         2513-2514 conferred rights in the nature of a common law easement with respect to allowing the placement of utility lines along rights-of-way no longer used for railway services, and the statutory right was construed to mean that the intrusion had to be generally of the type originally contemplated and could not materially burden the landowner beyond what was intended; (2) the District Court applied the correct legal standard to the claim by acknowledging that the owner of an easement could not materially increase the burden of it upon the servient estate, nor impose a new or additional burden thereon; (3) in support of summary judgment, the city and the State submitted evidence that the cable did not affect the owners' view and that the installation was not accompanied by any restriction on any activity; and (4) the owners provided no evidence that any view or activity would be limited or impaired in any significant way beyond the impairment inherent in the preexisting lines. Preseault v. City of Burlington, 464 F.3d 215 (2d Cir. 2006).

         Court certified to the Vermont Supreme Court the question of whether the City's right, which remained following the abandonment of the railroad easement, were in the nature of a common law easement or limited to maintaining the lines that existed prior to the abandonment.

         Although the plaintiffs argued the City's right to maintain existing electric lines did not grant it a right to install a fiber optic cable on existing utility poles, read together, 30 V.S.A.
         §§
         2513(b) and 2515 unequivocally grant the City such a right in this case, regardless of the fact that the utility easement arose as a result of a now defunct railway. Preseault v. City of Burlington, - F. Supp. 2d - (D. Vt. 2004), aff'd, 464 F.3d 215 (2d Cir. Vt. 2006).

         The plain intent of the Legislature in enacting 30 V.S.A.
         §§
         2513-2514 was to allow utilities to continue to provide electric and telecommunications services within railroad rights-of-way even after railroad operations cease. This statutory right is in the nature of an express easement and thus is subject to an increase-in-burden analysis under the common law. Utilities may continue to use the rights-of-way for their intended purposes so long as the uses do not materially increase the burden for which the landowners or their predecessors-in-title have already been compensated. Preseault v. City of Burlington, 180 Vt. 597, 908 A.2d 419 (mem.) (July 11, 2006).
        </p>
        <p>
         City, which had installed fiber-optic cables on existing utility poles located on property owners' land, and the State, which was the successor-in-title to the railroad that held a right-of-way on the owners' property, were properly granted summary judgment on the owners' claim that the installation of fiber-optic cable over a portion of their property, without compensation, violated the Takings Clause of Fifth Amendment because (1) 30 V.S.A.
         §§
         2513-2514 conferred rights in the nature of a common law easement with respect to allowing the placement of utility lines along rights-of-way no longer used for railway services, and the statutory right was construed to mean that the intrusion had to be generally of the type originally contemplated and could not materially burden the landowner beyond what was intended; (2) the District Court applied the correct legal standard to the claim by acknowledging that the owner of an easement could not materially increase the burden of it upon the servient estate, nor impose a new or additional burden thereon; (3) in support of summary judgment, the city and the State submitted evidence that the cable did not affect the owners' view and that the installation was not accompanied by any restriction on any activity; and (4) the owners provided no evidence that any view or activity would be limited or impaired in any significant way beyond the impairment inherent in the preexisting lines.

         Public Service Board properly held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to rule on a utility's declaratory judgment petition. The statute relied upon by the utility had no necessary application at all to the declaratory judgment it sought, as the utility did not assert, and had never asserted, a right to maintain the power line in its present location by virtue of adverse possession; that section being the only basis recited for the Board's jurisdiction, there was no error in the Board's determination that it had no power to rule on the declaratory judgment petition.

      Whenever the Commission, after a hearing had upon its own motion or upon complaint, finds that a physical connection can reasonably be made between the lines of two or more telephone companies or two or more telegraph companies whose lines can be made to form a continuous line of communication, by the construction and maintenance of suitable connections, for the transfer of messages or conversations, and that public convenience and necessity will be subserved thereby, or finds that two or more telegraph or telephone companies have failed to establish joint rates, tolls, or charges for service by or over their lines, and that joint rates, tolls, or charges ought to be established, the Commission may, by its order, (a) require that the connection be made, except where the purpose of the connection is primarily to secure the transmission of local messages or conversations between points within the same city or town, and that conversations be transmitted and messages transferred over the connection under such rules and regulations as the Commission may establish, and (b) may prescribe through lines and joint rates, tolls, and charges to be made and to be used, observed, and enforced in the future. If the telephone or telegraph companies do not agree upon the division of the joint rates, tolls, or charges established by the Commission over the through lines, the Commission may, after further hearing, establish the division by supplemental order.

        By requiring new hotel owner to pay telephone arrearage of prior owner in order for service to be reconnected and to retain the same phone numbers, telephone company discriminated against new owner on the basis of a collateral matter and violated both this section and case law as a result; therefore, Public Service Board erred in concluding that the telephone company's demand for payment of the arrearage was valid.

    <p>
     This chapter was enacted to meet a growing tendency on the part of public utilities to utilize the water power of the State for generating electricity to be used for commercial purposes outside the State, and to compel those utilities to furnish electricity to consumers located within the State under regulations and rates fixed by the Public Service Commission. Jones v. Montpelier & Barre Light & Power Co., 96 Vt. 397, 120 A. 103 (1923).

     This chapter was not intended to supersede or in any way interfere with the general supervisory powers of the Public Service Commission over utilities, including the fixing of rates for electricity sold for public or general use.

       <p>
        Legislature intended by this section to impress a dedication to reasonable public service on those generating electricity by water power and availing themselves of the power to take property and rights by eminent domain, or of the use of public highways for their transmission lines, and to restrict the power of eminent domain and such use of highways to those willing to assume a public service.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        One using a public highway for carrying electrical transmission lines erected for private use prior to enactment of this section was not required by this section to furnish energy to anyone desiring it, unless he or she had already voluntarily dedicated himself or herself to public service in the territory through which such lines passed. Valcour v. Village of Morrisville, 108 Vt. 242, 184 A. 881 (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that transmission lines over which a municipal corporation distributes surplus electricity outside its limits cross a highway in one or two places does not bring such corporation within the provisions of this section with respect to such lines, whereby it would be obliged to furnish service to anyone desiring it for certain designated purposes, subject to conditions and limitations imposed by the public service commission [now Board].

        The fact that one electric company was presently serving power to a village for its old well site did not preclude another company from being entitled to extend a line, and provide service, to a second and new well where its existing service facilities were nearer to the second well site than those of any other company.

        "Existing service facilities" were to be determined as of the date upon which request for electric service was made, and the right of an electric company with existing service facilities closest to the site to be served to serve that site came into being and was established when another company, to which application had been made for service, recognized that its facilities were not the closest and that it thus was not entitled to supply the service.

      1. Purpose.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     This chapter was intended to allow municipalities to fulfill a public need for electric service at economic rates; although a necessary subordinate purpose of this chapter is to allow municipalities to sell surplus power to nonresidents at a profit, the profit motive was not its underlying purpose. In re Ball Mountain Dam Hydroelectric Project, 154 Vt. 189, 576 A.2d 124 (1990).
    </p>
    <p>
     The purpose in enacting this chapter was to fulfill a need for electric service at economic rates, often in communities not served by private enterprise. In re Town of Springfield, 143 Vt. 483, 469 A.2d 375 (1983).
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
     The right and power to determine the establishment of a municipal electric utility are granted exclusively to the voters of that municipality, as long as the provisions of this chapter are duly complied with, and the Public Service Board is without jurisdiction either to review or deny such determination. In re Town of Springfield, 143 Vt. 483, 469 A.2d 375 (1983).

     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     Once a town has established a municipal utility pursuant to this chapter, it is subject to determinations of the Public Service Board regarding just and fair rates. In re Town of Springfield, 143 Vt. 483, 469 A.2d 375 (1983).

      4. Procedure.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     In an attempt by the Village of Derby Line to acquire Vermont Electric Cooperative's facilities serving the Village, the doctrine of laches precluded the electric company's motion to dismiss the proceedings relating to the Village's attempt to acquire the electric facilities on procedural grounds, where six years had elapsed between the time the Village voted in favor of acquiring the power plant and the time the electric company filed its motion to dismiss. In re Vermont Electric Cooperative, Inc., 165 Vt. 634, 687 A.2d 883 (mem.) (1994).

      If the municipality does not ratify such agreement for the purchase in the manner provided in section 2908 of this title or if the price cannot be agreed upon or if it cannot be agreed as to how much, if any, of such plant and property lying outside such municipality the public interest requires such municipality to purchase, either the municipality or the utility may petition the Commission for a determination of these questions. The Commission, after proper notice and hearing, shall decide the amount of just compensation and any other matters in dispute, and shall also, when required to fix the price to be paid for such plant and property, determine the amount of damages, if any, caused by the severance of the plant and property proposed to be purchased from the other plant and property of the utility. The Commission shall make its determinations on or before 12 months after the filing of the petition. The Commission may extend the time for determination an additional six months upon agreement of all of the parties or, absent such an agreement, upon a finding by the Commission, after notice and hearing, that such an extension is necessary to prevent injustice to one or more of the parties. From such determinations, there shall be the right of appeal to the Supreme Court on all matters involved as provided in chapter 1 of this title.

      After notice and public hearing, the Commission may authorize a municipality that has acquired or constructed and is operating a municipal plant to extend its mains or lines into an adjoining municipality in order to distribute and sell gas or electricity therein, provided that such outlying municipality is not then being supplied with gas or electricity by a municipal plant or by a utility or provided that the Commission finds that it will promote the general good of the State so to do.
    Such authorization shall be upon such terms and conditions and with such limitations and restrictions as the Commission finds will promote the general good of the State.

The bylaws may also provide for the removal of directors from office and for the election of their successors. Directors as such may not receive any salary for their services, but by resolution of the board of directors a fixed sum and expenses of attendance may be allowed for attendance at each meeting of the board of directors, or a committee thereof, or other customary activities necessary to carry out the duties of a director. The board of directors may exercise all of the powers of a cooperative not conferred upon the members by this chapter or its articles of incorporation or bylaws.

     <p>
      A cooperative that has commenced business may be dissolved in the following manner: The members at a meeting shall approve, by the affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds of the members voting thereon at such meeting, a proposal that the cooperative be dissolved. Upon such approval, a certificate of election to dissolve, hereinafter designated the "certificate," executed under oath and acknowledged on behalf of the cooperative by its president or vice president under its seal, attested by its secretary, and stating: (1) the name of the cooperative; (2) the address of its principal office; and (3) that the members of the cooperative have duly voted that the cooperative be dissolved, shall be filed with the Secretary of State. Upon filing of such certificate by the Secretary of State, the cooperative shall cease to carry on its business except to the extent necessary for the winding up thereof, but its corporate existence shall continue until a certificate of dissolution has been filed by the Secretary of State. The board of directors shall immediately cause notice of the dissolution proceedings to be mailed to each known creditor of and claimant against the cooperative and to be published once a week for two successive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation in the county in which the principal office of the cooperative is located. The board of directors shall wind up and settle the affairs of the cooperative, collect sums owing to it, liquidate its property and assets, pay and discharge its debts, obligations, and liabilities, and do all other things required to wind up its business. After paying or discharging or adequately providing for the payment or discharge of all its debts, obligations, and liabilities, the board shall distribute any remaining sums among its members and former members in proportion to the patronage of the respective members or former members during the seven years next preceding the date of the filing of the certificate by the Secretary of State, or if the cooperative has not been in existence for such period, then during the period of its existence prior to such filing. The board of directors shall thereupon authorize the execution of a certificate of dissolution, which shall be executed and acknowledged on behalf of the cooperative by its president or vice president, and its seal shall be affixed thereto and attested by its secretary. The certificate of dissolution shall recite that it is executed pursuant to this chapter and shall state: (1) the name of the cooperative; (2) the address of its principal office; (3) the date on which the certificate of election to dissolve was filed by the Secretary of State; (4) that there are no actions or suits pending against the cooperative; (5) that all debts, obligations, and liabilities of the cooperative have been paid and discharged or that adequate provision has been made therefor; and (6) that the provisions of this chapter relative to dissolution have been duly complied with.

The proposed contract reflecting the arrangement shall be filed with the Commission and the Department at least 45 days prior to its intended execution, and the Department shall make its recommendation as to whether it accepts or does not accept the contract within 30 days of the date on which the proposed contract was filed. Should the Department oppose the contract, or the Commission on its own motion determine that investigation into the contract is appropriate, the Commission shall hear evidence on the matter and shall determine, within seven months of the intended execution date, whether the contract promotes the general good as described in this subdivision.

       Vermont Public Power Supply System, Inc., a corporation formed under the provisions of subdivision 4003(4) of this title, is hereby declared and established to be a body politic and corporate with duties and powers as are set forth in this chapter, to be known as "Vermont Public Power Supply Authority" to carry out the provisions of this chapter.
    The Authority is constituted a public instrumentality exercising public and essential governmental functions, and the exercise by the authority of the powers conferred by this chapter shall be deemed and held to be the performance of an essential governmental function of the State.
      </li>
      <li id="t30p03c84sub02s5011ol1b">
       The Authority shall consist of those municipalities and cooperatives which by January 31, 1979 elected to become a member of Vermont Public Power Supply System, Inc., in accordance with the terms of its bylaws, and those Vermont municipalities and cooperatives that shall thereafter elect to become members of the Authority in accordance with the rules and regulations of the Authority established by it.
    These rules and regulations shall be calculated to permit membership without an undue burden on new members, but with regard to the benefits contributed to the Authority by its original members.
      </li>
      <li id="t30p03c84sub02s5011ol1c">
       The powers of the Authority shall be exercised by a board of directors.
    The Board of Directors shall consist of one director from each member municipality or member cooperative, who shall be elected by the legislative body of each member municipality or the board of trustees of each member cooperative.
    Each municipality or cooperative may also elect an alternate director to serve in the absence or disability of its director.
    The term of office of a director shall be for one year coincident with the fiscal year of the Authority or until a successor director has been duly elected and qualified.
    Any director may be removed at the pleasure of the legislative body of the municipality or cooperative which elected that director, upon notice to the authority and the election of a successor director.
    The Board of Directors of the Authority shall adopt bylaws or other rules and regulations for the management of the affairs of the Authority and carrying out the purpose of this chapter.
    The Board of Directors shall also elect one of its member directors as chair of the Authority and shall also elect a treasurer and secretary who may be, but need not be, directors.

       Despite any law or charter provision to the contrary, a director or officer of the Authority who is also an officer, employee, or member of a legislative body of a municipality or other public body or the State shall not thereby be precluded from voting or acting on behalf of the Authority on a matter involving the municipality or public body or the State. Neither shall service as a director or officer of the Authority constitute a conflict of interest for an officer, employee, or member of a municipality or public body or the State.

Upon termination of the existence of the Authority, title to all of the property owned by the Authority, including any net earnings of the Authority, shall vest in the State. The State reserves the right at any time to alter, amend, repeal, or otherwise change the structure, organization, programs, or activities of the Authority, including the power to terminate the Authority, subject to any limitation on the impairment of the obligation of any contract or contracts entered into by the Authority.

      A municipality may by resolution of its legislative body enter into contracts with the Authority for the purchase, sale, exchange, or transmission of electric energy and other services, on such terms and for such period of time as the resolution may provide. A municipality may by resolution of its legislative body enter into a contract with the Authority related to the issuance of bonds and notes as authorized by section 5031 of this title only after an affirmative vote of the qualified voters at any duly warned annual or special meeting held for that purpose. The required vote may either approve a specific contract with the Authority or it may approve generally the right for the municipality to enter into all such contracts with the Authority by resolution of its legislative body. A municipality may appropriate electricity-derived revenues received in any year to make payments due during that year under any contract made by the municipality with the Authority. Nothing in this section shall be construed to repeal any charter provision or law requiring an election or other condition precedent to the establishment of a municipal electric plant.

      The Authority may provide for the issuance of refunding obligations for the purpose of refunding any obligations then outstanding which have been issued under the provisions of this chapter, including the payment of any redemption premium on them and any interest accrued or to accrue to the date of redemption of those obligations and for any corporate purpose of the Authority.
    The issuance of the obligations, the maturities and other details pertaining to them, the rights of their holders, and the rights, duties, and obligations of the Authority in respect to them shall be governed by the provisions of this chapter which relate to the issuance of obligations, insofar as those provisions may be appropriate.

      Refunding obligations issued as provided in section 5032 of this title may be sold or exchanged for outstanding obligations issued under this chapter and, if sold, the proceeds from them may be applied, in addition to any other authorized purposes, to the purchase, redemption, or payment of those outstanding obligations.
    Pending the application of the proceeds of any refunding obligations, with any other available funds, to the payment of the principal, accrued interest, and any redemption premium on the obligations being refunded, and, if so provided or permitted in the resolution authorizing the issuance of such refunding obligations or in the trust agreement securing them to the payment of any interest on refunding obligations and any expenses in connection with refunding, such proceeds may be invested as specified in the resolution authorizing the obligations to be refunded or the trust agreement securing them.
    These investments shall mature or shall be subject to redemption by their holders, at the option of the holders, not later than the respective dates when the proceeds, together with the interest accruing on them, will be required for the purposes intended.

     §
    
    1 provides: "It is the intent of the General Assembly to maintain a robust and modern telecommunications network in Vermont by making strategic investments in improved technology for all Vermonters. To achieve that goal, it is the purpose of this act to upgrade the State's telecommunications objectives and reorganize government functions in a manner that results in more coordinated and efficient State programs and policies, and, ultimately, produces operational savings that may be invested in further deployment of broadband and mobile telecommunications services for the benefit of all Vermonters. In addition, it is the intent of the General Assembly to update and provide for a more equitable application of the Universal Service Fund (USF) surcharge. Together, these operational savings and additional USF monies will raise at least $1 million annually, as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(1) $650,000.00 from an increase in the USF charge to a flat two percent;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) $450,000.00 from application of the USF charge to prepaid wireless telecommunications service providers; and
    </p>
    <p>
     "(3) $300,000.00 in operational savings from the transfer and consolidation of State telecommunications functions."

       Except as provided in subsection (h) of this section, a VETC shall provide broadband Internet access at speeds no lower than 25 Mbps download and 3 Mbps upload in each high-cost area it serves within five years of designation. A VETC need not provide broadband service to a location that has service available from another service provider, as determined by the Department of Public Service.

       The Public Utility Commission may modify the buildout requirements of subsection (d) of this section as it relates to broadband Internet access to be the geographic area that could be reached using one-half of the funds to be received over five years. A VETC may seek such waiver of the buildout requirements within one year of designation and shall demonstrate the cost of meeting broadband Internet access requirements on an exchange basis and propose an alternative buildout plan.

       The amount of the monthly support under this section shall be the pro rata share of available funds based on the total number of incumbent local exchange carriers in the State and reflecting each carrier's lines in service or service locations in its high-cost area or areas, as determined under subsection (e) of this section. If an incumbent local exchange carrier does not petition the Commission for VETC designation, or is found ineligible by the Commission, the share of funds it otherwise would have received under this section shall be used to support the Connectivity Initiative established in section 7515b of this chapter.

     §
    
    3 provides: "(a) There is created a high-cost program under which the universal service charge shall be used as a means of keeping basic telecommunications service affordable in all parts of this state, thereby maintaining universal service. Payments shall be made to Vermont's incumbent local exchange carriers (ILECs) for the purpose of reducing the cost of providing basic local telecommunications service in areas where that cost would otherwise jeopardize universal service or uniform economic development.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(b) Funds distributed under the high-cost program are intended to defray the cost an ILEC incurs in building and maintaining its network so that it stands ready to serve any customer in its service area, even those in the most remote areas of Vermont. In order to achieve this goal, funding shall not be based upon the number of basic telecommunications services ordered, but rather upon the cost to serve any customer in that service area who may request basic local exchange service. This includes the costs of building and maintaining the entire network in each exchange in the applicable service area.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(c) The fiscal agent shall make distributions for the high-cost program to the ILECs, as required by this section. The percentage of funds distributed to each ILEC shall reflect the percentage of total access lines reported by each ILEC in its annual report to the public service board.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(d) Any funds in excess of $1,000,000.00 remaining in the Vermont universal service fund as of September 1, 2012 shall be distributed among all the ILECs in a manner determined by the commissioner of public service."

         1. Plant.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Public Utility Commission properly concluded that two proposed solar electric facilities were a single "plant" because they were not only commonly owned, physically contiguous, and designed to fit together, but their interconnection to the grid required the developer to construct a mile-long line extension at its own expense, the use of which would be shared by the facilities and which the PUC considered to be a single interconnection facility. In re Chelsea Solar LLC, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (Apr. 16, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Definition of "plant" does not address final ownership of equipment and infrastructure; it focuses instead on the use of common - i.e., shared - equipment and infrastructure. In re Chelsea Solar LLC, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (Apr. 16, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutory definition of "plant" does not require exclusive use of common infrastructure for facilities to be considered a single plant. In re Chelsea Solar LLC, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (Apr. 16, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Second sentence of the statutory definition of "plant" makes clear that electrical generation facilities are not independent if they share technical features such as equipment and infrastructure. The logical corollary of the second sentence is that facilities that are not part of the same project and do not share equipment and infrastructure should be considered separate plants. In re Programmatic Changes, 196 Vt. 175, 95 A.3d 999 (Mar. 28, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the plain language of the statutory definition of "plant," two solar power projects would qualify as "independent technical facilities," as they would not share common roads, control facilities, or connections to the electric grid, and each would have a separate interconnection agreement and separate interconnection facilities, which would limit the capacity of each to 2.0 megawatts. As independent plants, both should have been awarded standard-offer contracts under the terms of the request for proposals because they were the lowest and second-lowest priced projects, respectively. In re Programmatic Changes, 196 Vt. 175, 95 A.3d 999 (Mar. 28, 2014).

        It is logical to conclude from the statutory scheme and the language used in the subsection of the Standard Offer Program statute governing provider blocks that are not fully subscribed that the Public Utility Commission is to add the unsubscribed capacity to the annual increase and then allocate twenty percent of the sum to the provider block and eighty percent to the developer block.

       <p>
        Having interpreted the standard-offer statute to mandate the reallocation of unsubscribed capacity to the annual increase for the following year and then proceeding along the twenty-eighty-percent line - a practice the Public Utility Commission (PUC) has followed since 2013 - it was reasonable for the PUC to adopt the same approach for the new capacity resulting from terminated contracts. This approach was permitted under the flexible language of the subsection regarding termination; suggested by other provisions in the statutory scheme; and within the PUC's broad statutory authority to implement the standard-offer program.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Statute entitled "Small renewable energy plants; simplified procedures" states that renewable energy plants of 2.2 megawatts (MW) or less are entitled to streamlined approval procedures, and the title suggests that the Legislature considers "small" plants to be those with capacities of less than 2.2 MW. A cluster of plants totaling 4.0 MW therefore could reasonably be defined as "moderate" in size. In re Programmatic Changes, 196 Vt. 175, 95 A.3d 999 (Mar. 28, 2014).

      <li id="t30p03c91s8060ol1a">
       The General Assembly finds that:
       <ol>
        <li id="t30p03c91s8060ol1a1">
         The availability of mobile telecommunications and broadband services is essential for promoting the economic development of the State, the education of its young people and lifelong learning, the delivery of cost-effective health care, the public safety, and the ability of citizens to participate fully in society and civic life.
        </li>
        <li id="t30p03c91s8060ol1a2">
         Private entities have brought mobile telecommunications and broadband services to many households, businesses, and locations in the State. Nevertheless, significant gaps remain in 99 target communities for broadband service, and in community hubs and along the routes which connect them for mobile telecommunications service.
        </li>
        <li id="t30p03c91s8060ol1a3">
         A new level of creative and innovative strategies (including partnerships and collaborations among and between State entities, nonprofit organizations, municipalities, the federal government, and the private sector) is necessary to extend and complete broadband coverage in the State, and to ensure that Vermont maintains a telecommunications infrastructure that allows residents and businesses to compete fairly in the national and global economy.
        </li>
        <li id="t30p03c91s8060ol1a4">
         When such partnerships and collaborations fail to achieve the goal of providing high-quality broadband access and service to all areas and households, or when some areas of the State fall behind significantly in the variety and quality of services readily available in the State, it is necessary for an authority of the State to support and facilitate the construction of infrastructure and access to broadband service through financial and other incentives.
        </li>
        <li id="t30p03c91s8060ol1a5">
         Small broadband enterprises now offering broadband service in Vermont have limited access to financial capital necessary for expansion of broadband service to unserved areas of the State. The General Assembly recognizes these locally based broadband providers for their contributions to date in providing broadband service to unserved areas despite the limitations on their financial resources.
        </li>
        <li id="t30p03c91s8060ol1a6">
         The universal availability of adequate mobile telecommunications and broadband services promotes the general good of the State.
        </li>
        <li id="t30p03c91s8060ol1a7">
         Vermonters should be served by broadband infrastructure that, to the extent practical and cost-effective, uses the best commercially available technology and does not involve widespread installation of technology that becomes outmoded within a short period after installation.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t30p03c91s8060ol1b">
       Therefore, it is the goal of the General Assembly to ensure:
       <ol>
        <li id="t30p03c91s8060ol1b1">
         that all residences and business in all regions of the State have access to affordable broadband services not later than the end of the year 2013, and that this goal be achieved in a manner that, to the extent practical and cost-effective, does not negatively affect the future installation of the best commercially available broadband technology or result in widespread installation of technology that becomes outmoded within a short period after installation;
        </li>
        <li id="t30p03c91s8060ol1b2">
         the universal availability of mobile telecommunication services, including voice and high-speed data along roadways, and near universal availability statewide;
        </li>
        <li id="t30p03c91s8060ol1b3">
         the investment in telecommunications infrastructure in the State that creates or completes the network for service providers to create last-mile connection to the home or business and supports the best available and economically feasible service capabilities;
        </li>
        <li id="t30p03c91s8060ol1b4">
         that telecommunications and broadband infrastructure in all areas of the State is continuously upgraded to reflect the rapid evolution in the capabilities of available mobile telecommunications and broadband technologies, and in the capabilities of mobile telecommunications and broadband services needed by persons, businesses, and institutions in the State;
        </li>
        <li id="t30p03c91s8060ol1b5">
         the most efficient use of both public and private resources through State policies by encouraging the development of open access telecommunications infrastructure that can be shared by multiple service providers.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t30p03c91s8060ol1c">
       The statutory purpose of the exemption for Vermont Telecommunications Authority (VTA) bonds and notes in section 8074 of this title is to lower the cost of borrowing in order to finance the expansion of broadband access across the State.

     Legislative findings and intent.
    </b>
    <cite class="vt-code">2021, No. 71</cite>,
    
     §
    
    1 provides: "(a) The General Assembly finds that:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(1) For over a decade, Vermont has pursued many approaches and strategies designed to ensure that every Vermonter has access to reliable, affordable, high-speed broadband.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) In 2018, through Acts and Resolves No. 169, the General Assembly found that broadband is essential for supporting economic and educational opportunities, strengthening health and public safety networks, and reinforcing freedom of expression and democratic, social, and civic engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(3) We further found in Act No. 169 that the lack of a thriving competitive market in Vermont, particularly in isolated locations, disadvantages the ability of consumers and businesses to protect their interests sufficiently, and we recognized that the State may exercise its traditional role in protecting consumers.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(4) In 2019, through Acts and Resolves No. 79, the General Assembly found that despite the FCC's 'light-touch' regulatory approach under Title I of the Communications Act of 1934, rather than 'utility-style' regulation under Title II, existing broadband providers are not providing adequate service to many rural areas where fewer potential customers reduce the profitability necessary to justify network expansion.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(5) Accordingly, reaching the last mile will require a grassroots approach founded on input from and support of local communities. Existing broadband grant programs do not offer the scale to solve this problem, and traditional capital sources typically shy away from businesses with limited revenue history and little equity or collateral.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(6) To this end, public investment in programs and personnel that provide local communities with much-needed resources and technical assistance is required.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(7) In 2020, the COVID-19 public health emergency served as an accelerant to the socioeconomic disparities between the connected and the unconnected in our State. Vermonters who cannot access or cannot afford broadband, many of whom are geographically isolated, face challenges with respect to distance learning; remote working; accessing telehealth services; and accessing government programs and services, including our institutions of democracy, such as the court system.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(8) Indeed, the ongoing public health emergency has highlighted the extent to which robust and resilient broadband networks are critical to our economic future as a whole and provide a foundation for our educational, health care, public health and safety, and democratic institutions.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(9) Broadband infrastructure is critical infrastructure fundamental to accessing other critical services in sectors such as energy, public safety, government, health care, education, and commerce.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(10) The goal of universal broadband needs to be elevated as a top priority of the State to meet the economic, health, safety, educational, and social needs of Vermonters.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(11) While private broadband providers have brought broadband services to many households, businesses, and locations in Vermont, significant gaps remain.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(12) When existing broadband providers fail to achieve the goal of providing reliable, high-quality, universal broadband, it is imperative for the State to support and facilitate the construction of broadband infrastructure through financial and other means.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(13) Communications union districts (CUDs) were created by the State to coordinate and implement creative and innovative solutions in their respective territories, particularly where existing providers are not providing adequate service that meets the needs of their residents and businesses while ensuring public accountability.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(14) CUDs are thus positioned to be the unofficial 'provider of last resort' for broadband and ensure public accountability for serving all Vermonters within their respective service territories. Yet CUDs have limited access to financial capital necessary for expansion of broadband to unserved and underserved areas of the State.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(15) All Vermont electric ratepayers are supporting the rollout of clean energy technologies, however not all ratepayers are able to access those technologies because they do not have access to adequate broadband. Equity in the energy sector requires universal broadband.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(16) The Department of Public Service simultaneously plays a regulatory role in the telecommunications market while also supporting the development of CUDs in an unregulated competitive broadband market.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(17) To ensure universal broadband in Vermont, there is a need for greater coordination of grassroots broadband solutions both among the CUDs themselves and also with respect to their other potential partners, such as electric distribution utilities, nonprofit organizations, the federal government, and private broadband providers.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(18) In addition to broadband access, it is imperative for the State to address the critical issues of broadband affordability and adoption.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(19) The Department of Public Service estimates that 82 percent of Vermont addresses (254,000 locations) lack access to 100 Mbps symmetrical service. The total cost to provide 100 Mbps symmetrical service to each of these locations is approximately $1,000,000,000.00. This figure is based on estimates in the Magellan Advisors' report commissioned by the Department, and it includes estimates of both fixed and variable capital costs for fiber to the premise infrastructure (Feasibility Study of Electric Companies Offering Broadband in Vermont, dated December 31, 2019).
    </p>
    <p>
     "(b) Therefore, this act is intended to protect the public interest by:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(1) ensuring broadband availability to all Vermonters and Vermont addresses;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) ensuring public accountability for maintaining and upgrading critical broadband infrastructure;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(3) increasing the reliability of the electric grid and ensuring equal access to clean energy services among all electric ratepayers;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(4) protecting Vermonters' privacy and unrestricted access to the Internet;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(5) alleviating the inherent tension the Department of Public Service currently experiences as a result of its dual roles as both regulator and community project developer;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(6) directing public resources to the development of public broadband assets intended to provide universal access;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(7) developing favorable taxing, financing, and regulatory mechanisms to support communications union districts; and
    </p>
    <p>
     "(8) providing time-limited leadership for coordinating the buildout of Vermont's communications union districts and their partners and for developing financing mechanisms to fully support that buildout through a newly created State entity, the Vermont Community Broadband Board, designed specifically to effectuate these purposes."

     §
    
    5 provides: "The public service board shall conduct an investigation into the benefits and costs of construction of fiber-optic or other telecommunications facility networks linking electric company substations and submit a report to the committees of jurisdiction of the general assembly on or before January 15, 2009. In addition to other information it deems appropriate, the public service board shall require from each electric company an analysis of the likely cost of connecting its substations with fiber-optic facilities and other alternative means, and the benefits to electric company operations, including benefits for system management and reliability. If it finds good cause to do so, the board may excuse companies without more than one substation and companies which have already connected all company substations with fiber-optic facilities. In the event that the public service board determines that the benefit of such a network exceeds its costs, it shall recommend an implementation schedule for construction of such a network and include the schedule in its report. The board may issue an implementation schedule for individual companies prior to January 15, 2009."

    </p>
    <p>
     "(1) The use of fossil fuels for heat and power contributes to emissions of greenhouse gases and climate change.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) Fossil fuel prices in recent years have been highly volatile, and significant potential exists for those prices to reach rates that are equal to or greater than the exceptionally high prices seen within the last few years.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(3) Payments for fossil fuels by Vermonters involve the movement of significant sums of money outside the state and the country to pay for heating fuel, draining Vermont's economy.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(4) The state of Vermont seeks to ensure that Vermonters obtain a greater measure of control over the environmental impacts of energy use and energy costs.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(5) The state of Vermont seeks to increase its efforts to limit its emissions of greenhouse gases.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(6) Community energy infrastructure that uses renewable fuels can reduce the environmental impacts of energy use and provide a community with the opportunity to obtain heat and potentially power at stable prices that reduce the economic risks associated with fossil fuels. Local energy purchases recirculate money in the Vermont economy and can provide businesses with competitive energy rates.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(7) The state of Vermont seeks to establish incentives for communities to host energy generation that is renewable and efficiently utilized and that provides heat and potentially power to groups of commercial, industrial, or residential uses, or combinations of such uses, within the community."
