        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The Lobbying Act is not overbroad on its face; lobbying disclosure laws are supported by compelling interests such as the government's interest in requiring disclosure of lobbyist information in order to protect the integrity of the governmental process. Kimbell v. Hooper, 164 Vt. 80, 665 A.2d 44 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether or not the Lobbying Act exceeds its "plainly legitimate sweep" by requiring disclosure of the costs of "background activity," which involves research, meetings, preparation of materials, and media involvement, the court decided that the State's lobbyist disclosure law is a reasonable means of evaluating the lobbyist's influence on the political process and thus is narrowly tailored to accomplish its purpose. Kimbell v. Hooper, 164 Vt. 80, 665 A.2d 44 (1995).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The vagueness doctrine is based on the rationale that persons should not be "chilled" when exercising their constitutional rights by the fear of criminal sanctions, but the fear of prosecution must be based on reasonable interpretations of the statute in question. Kimbell v. Hooper, 164 Vt. 80, 665 A.2d 44 (1995).

        Lobby tax is a tax imposed directly on expenditures connected with communications and activities aimed at influencing legislation, and, thus, it is not part of a generally applicable sales tax that applies to a broad range of services, but rather singles out lobbying, a protected First Amendment interest, for special treatment; as such, heightened scrutiny is warranted, and, because the State proffers no government interest apart from the raising of revenue, the tax cannot withstand such scrutiny. Vermont Society of Ass'n Executives v. Milne, 172 Vt. 375, 779 A.2d 20 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Without a factual record of specific enforcement measures used to prevent anyone from influencing legislators, the Supreme Court could not gauge the extent of any "chilling effect" that might result from the State's lobbyist disclosure law, and without a particular burden or deterrent effect imposed by the law, a law cannot be declared unconstitutional on its face on the basis that it might be unconstitutionally enforced under speculative circumstances. Kimbell v. Hooper, 164 Vt. 80, 665 A.2d 44 (1995).

        Because revenues from the lobby tax are not intended to compensate the State for administering Vermont's lobbyist disclosure statute, the tax cannot be construed as a regulatory fee. Vermont Society of Ass'n Executives v. Milne, 172 Vt. 375, 779 A.2d 20 (2001).

        This section, which bans soliciting or contributing to individuals' political campaigns, functions as a timing measure, banning contributions to individual members only, not to political parties, while the General Assembly is in session, and focuses on a narrow period during which legislators could be, or could appear to be, pressured, coerced, or tempted into voting on the basis of cash contributions; therefore, as a narrowly drawn measure chosen to avoid a serious appearance of impropriety, this section is not overbroad.
