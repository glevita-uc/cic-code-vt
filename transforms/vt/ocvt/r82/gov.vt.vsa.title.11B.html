     <p>
      The articles of incorporation or bylaws may provide for staggering the terms of directors by dividing the total number of directors into two, three, four, five, or six groups, with each group containing one-half, one-third, one-quarter, one-fifth or one-sixth of the total, as near as may be. In that event, the terms of the directors in the first group expire at the first annual members' meeting after their election, the terms of the second group expire at the second members' meeting after their election, and the terms of the third group, fourth group, fifth group, and sixth group, if any, expire at the third, fourth, fifth, or sixth annual members' meeting after their election. At each annual members' meeting held thereafter, directors shall be chosen for a term not to exceed six years, as the case may be, to succeed those whose terms expire.

         1. Liability following reinstatement.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Whether reinstatement of a corporation after an involuntary dissolution operates to shield personal liability must depend on the reasonable expectations of the parties at the time the liability arises. These expectations will be shaped by the context in which the liability arises, especially the nature of the obligation, the parties' knowledge, and the timing of the corporate termination and the liability. Daniels v. Elks Club of Hartford, 192 Vt. 114, 58 A.3d 925 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        It would be a clear abuse of a club's status to deny liability of the members when after operating for nineteen years as a voluntary association because of the involuntary termination of its corporate status, the club reinstated its corporate status less than two months after the final judgment on the merits of discrimination litigation. By that time, it knew that it faced a judgment of at least $25,000 and the future imposition of a large attorney's fee award against it; it then reinstated its corporate status, potentially eliminating the responsibility of members to pay the judgment if the club could not do so. Daniels v. Elks Club of Hartford, 192 Vt. 114, 58 A.3d 925 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Reinstatement of the corporate status after involuntary dissolution will not restore the corporate shield on personal liability for a person who knew, or should have known by virtue of the person's position, that there was no corporate shield at the time of the act that created liability. This rule conforms to the principle that the reinstatement provision should be interpreted in a manner that preserves the expectations of the parties at the time when the liability arose. Daniels v. Elks Club of Hartford, 192 Vt. 114, 58 A.3d 925 (2012).

        Because the taxpayer, a Michigan nonprofit corporation, was not authorized to transact business in Vermont until it obtained a certificate of authority in February 2019, it was not eligible for a tax exemption prior to then and was not entitled to a refund of taxes it paid or owed previously.
