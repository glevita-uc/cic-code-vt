    Adoption.
   </b>
   Congress, on February 21, 1787, called a convention of delegates to be appointed by the several states, to be held at Philadelphia on the second Monday of the next May. The convention met, and, on the 25th of May, elected George Washington President. It completed and agreed upon the Constitution, which, on September 17, 1787, was signed and, with a letter and resolution, submitted to Congress. The resolution declared that it was the opinion of the convention that the Constitution should be submitted to a convention of delegates chosen in each state by the people thereof, under the recommendation of its legislature, for their assent and ratification; and that each convention ratifying it should notify Congress; also that, after ratification by nine states, Congress should fix a day for the appointment of electors by the ratifying states, a day on which the electors should meet to vote for President, and the time and place for commencing proceedings under the Constitution. The Constitution, with the letter and resolution of the convention, was, September 28, 1787, transmitted by Congress to the several legislatures. It was ratified by conventions in the several states on the following dates: Delaware, December 7, 1787; Pennsylvania, December 12, 1787; New Jersey, December 18, 1787; Georgia, January 2, 1788; Connecticut, January 9, 1788; Massachusetts, February 6, 1788; Maryland, April 28, 1788; South Carolina, May 23, 1788; New Hampshire, June 21, 1788; Virginia, June 26, 1788; and New York, July 26, 1788. Congress was notified of the action of these conventions, and, on September 13, 1788, setting forth that the Constitution had been ratified in the manner therein declared to be sufficient for its establishment, fixed New York as the place, and the first Wednesday, being the fourth day of March, 1789, as the time, for commencing proceedings under it. After the Constitution of the United States commenced in operation, March 4, 1789, it was ratified by the convention of North Carolina, November 21, 1789; and by that of Rhode Island, May 29, 1790. It was ratified by a convention of delegates of the people of Vermont, January 10, 1791; and, on March 4, 1791, by an act of Congress, approved February 18, 1791, the State of Vermont was admitted into the union as the fourteenth state.

        Because of similarity of restrictions upon delegation of legislative authority implied in this section and section 8 of this article and those implied in the Vermont Constitution, United States Supreme Court cases bearing upon the question are to be considered when the propriety of such delegation is in issue.

        Any legislation of a state, although in pursuance of an acknowledged power reserved to it, which conflicts with the actual exercise of the power of Congress over the subject of interstate commerce, must give way before the supremacy of the national authority.

        §
        8911(8), which imposes a use tax on family transfers of vehicles coming from outside the State, but does not impose a similar tax on the same family transfer inside the State, violates both the Equal Protection Clause and the Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution. Pawa v. McDonald, 921 F. Supp. 227 (D. Vt. 1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Test for determining if a tax violates the Commerce Clause is whether activity taxed has a substantial nexus with the State, whether tax is fairly apportioned, whether tax discriminates against interstate commerce, and whether tax is fairly related to benefits provided by state. Barringer v. Griffes, 1 F.3d 1331 (2d Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1072, 114 S. Ct. 879, 127 L. Ed. 2d 75 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont motor vehicle purchase and use tax violated Commerce Clause to extent that use tax was collected from out-of-state residents without crediting sales taxes they may have paid to other states; in absence of such a credit, tax discriminated against interstate commerce by providing advantage to local automobile dealers whose products would effectively cost less, inducing individuals moving to Vermont to purchase their automobiles in Vermont. Barringer v. Griffes, 1 F.3d 1331 (2d Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1072, 114 S. Ct. 879, 127 L. Ed. 2d 75 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont motor vehicle use tax was not fairly apportioned and therefore violated Commerce Clause; if all states employed Vermont's tax plan and did not provide credit for taxes paid to other states, a vehicle registered in several states during its useful life would be taxed considerably more than a vehicle that spent its entire life in one state, thus burdening vehicles transported in interstate commerce. Barringer v. Griffes, 1 F.3d 1331 (2d Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1072, 114 S. Ct. 879, 127 L. Ed. 2d 75 (1994).

        A state tax does not offend the Commerce Clause if it is applied to an activity that has a substantial nexus with taxing state, is fairly apportioned, does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and is fairly related to benefits provided by state. Barringer v. Griffes, 801 F. Supp. 1282 (D. Vt. 1992), rev'd on other grounds, 1 F.3d 1331 (2d Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1072, 114 S. Ct. 879, 127 L. Ed. 2d 75 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Merely because an activity affects or is affected by interstate commerce does not by itself foreclose a state's power to tax that activity. Barringer v. Griffes, 801 F. Supp. 1282 (D. Vt. 1992), rev'd on other grounds, 1 F.3d 1331 (2d Cir. 1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 1072, 114 S. Ct. 879, 127 L. Ed. 2d 75 (1994).

        When personal property has been brought into a state and come to a permanent rest, or merely halted for a moment before resuming its interstate journey, taxes upon the privilege of use, storage, or consumption within the state do not impose an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. Leverson v. Conway, 144 Vt. 523, 481 A.2d 1029 (1984), appeal dismissed, 469 U.S. 926, 105 S. Ct. 316, 83 L. Ed. 2d 255 (1984), vacated and remanded, 472 U.S. 1014, 105 S. Ct. 3471, 87 L.

        A state tax will be sustained under the Commerce Clause of this section when (1) the business activity is sufficiently corrected to the state to justify a tax, (2) the tax is fairly related to benefits provided the taxpayer, (3) the tax does not discriminate against interstate commerce, and (4) the tax is fairly apportioned. Frank W. Whitcomb Construction Corp. v. Commissioner of Taxes, 144 Vt. 466, 479 A.2d 164 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        To be upheld under the Commerce Clause of this section, a tax on interstate commerce must be applied to an activity with a substantial nexus with the taxing state, must be fairly apportioned, must not discriminate against interstate commerce, and must be fairly related to the services provided by the state. American Trucking Associations, Inc. v. Conway, 142 Vt. 17, 451 A.2d 42 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        All tax burdens do not impermissibly impede interstate commerce; the Commerce Clause balances tips against the tax only when it unfairly burdens commerce by exacting more than a just share from the interstate activity.

        While property actually in transit from one state to another is exempt from local taxation as an unlawful interference with interstate commerce, there may be an interior movement of property which does not constitute interstate commerce, although it comes from or is destined to another state.

        With regard to defendant's Ex Post Facto Clause claim, designating defendant "high risk" was for the sole purpose of increasing public access to his status as a sex offender and related information; after the trial court's decision holding that the statute prohibiting early release until 70 percent of a "high risk" offender's maximum sentence was completed violated the Ex Post Facto Clause, that statute had no legal effect on the length of defendant's incarceration; and defendant could point to no statute or administrative directive that retroactively removed or limited the Vermont Department of Corrections' discretion over his treatment programming and that consequently resulted in a longer period of incarceration.

        Plaintiffs had not shown an Ex Post Facto Clause violation in that statutory and administrative changes subsequent to their incarceration did not remove or limit the discretion vested in the Parole Board and the Department of Corrections. The statute enumerating "listed crimes" for purposes of the victims' rights statute did not increase or even apply to the length of plaintiffs' incarceration, and thus did not facially violate the Ex Post Facto Clause; furthermore, there was no evidence that in 1992, inmates like plaintiffs who were convicted of serious violent offenses and were determined to pose a high risk of reoffending would have been released at their minimum even if they completed programming. Wool v. Pallito, 207 Vt. 586, 193 A.3d 510 (June 29, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1999 addition of the list of offenses that qualify as "listed crimes" for purposes of the victims' rights statute did not change the statutory punishment for any of the listed crimes; nor did the amendment alter the standards for determining either the initial date for parole eligibility or an inmate's suitability for parole. The statute does not increase or even apply to the length of incarceration, and therefore does not facially violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. Wool v. Pallito, 207 Vt. 586, 193 A.3d 510 (June 29, 2018).
       </p>

        Although the facts alleged in the affidavit supported a charge of aggravated sexual assault, defendant's inability to ascertain the penalty prejudiced defendant and violated his right under the rule regarding the nature and contents of an indictment or information to be notified of the charges. Moreover, because defendant's underlying convictions violated the Ex Post Facto Clause, relying on the sufficiency of the information to find defendant guilty of the statutes in effect at the time of his alleged acts stretched the limits of the rule. State v. Rondeau, 203 Vt. 518, 159 A.3d 1073 (Nov. 18, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Retrospectively applied sentencing range - a ten year mandatory minimum with a maximum of life in prison - created a sufficient risk that defendant would receive a higher sentence and, as a result, constituted an ex post facto violation under Calder's third category. State v. Rondeau, 203 Vt. 518, 159 A.3d 1073 (Nov. 18, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's conviction violated the Ex Post Facto Clause in two respects: first, the law specifically prohibiting aggravated sexual assault of a child did not exist at the time the alleged acts occurred; second, an analogous law in effect when the alleged acts occurred - aggravated sexual assault as part of a common scheme - imposed a lesser mandatory minimum than the statute defendant was convicted of violating. State v. Rondeau, 203 Vt. 518, 159 A.3d 1073 (Nov. 18, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner's inability to complete a rehabilitative program by the expiration of his minimum sentence, which was restored following petitioner's successful challenge to the application of the delayed-release statute, was not in and of itself an Ex Post Facto Clause violation. It was at most a collateral consequence of a constellation of factors. In re Blow, 194 Vt. 416, 82 A.3d 554 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        If in fact the 2001 amendment to the furlough statute created a sufficient risk of eliminating an inmate's eligibility for parole, then the inmate's claim of an Ex Post Facto Clause violation might prevail. Whether the amendment here produced a significant risk of increasing the inmate's sentence could not be determined without the factual development precluded by trial court's granting of a motion to dismiss. Girouard v. Hofmann, 186 Vt. 153, 981 A.2d 419 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute conferring upon justices of the peace jurisdiction of an offense committed prior to passage of the statute was not unconstitutional as an ex post facto law, since it related solely to the remedy by which an offense, as it existed under the law then in force, could be punished in accordance with that law, and did not change the punishment, the rules of evidence, nor what constituted the offense. State v. Welch, 65 Vt. 50, 25 A. 900 (1892).

        Stipulation in charter of corporation, not subject to alteration or repeal, respecting rate of taxation, providing for commutation or for entire exemption of corporation property, accepted and acted upon by corporation, was inviolable contract under this section, and could not be revoked by subsequent statute or by amendment to State Constitution without assent of corporation.

        Congress has express power to enact bankruptcy laws directly impairing obligation of contracts, and it may pass laws in the execution of other powers expressly given, which incidentally have that effect; but other than this, it has no constitutional power to impair or destroy vested rights.

        Statute, providing that a surety could make any defense which the principal could, was not unconstitutional, since it pertained only to the remedy and did not impair obligation of the contract. Flagg v. Locke, 74 Vt. 320, 52 A. 424 (1902).

       <p>
        While the legislature of a state may make laws affecting the remedy for the enforcement of a contract, altering its character, or substituting one remedy for another, it cannot, by reason of the prohibition against impairing the obligation of contracts, deprive a party of all remedy.

       </p>
       <p>
        As attachment was not a part of the contract, but a remedy for the breach of it, the Legislature might provide that where a debtor had not sufficient property to pay all his debts it should be equitably distributed among all his creditors. Baldwin v. Buswell, 52 Vt. 57 (1879).
       </p>
       <p>
        Laws that change and modify remedies, forms of proceedings, or the tribunal itself are recognized as valid, provided they do not directly or indirectly destroy or abolish all remedy whatever by which performance of any class of valid legal contracts may be enforced.

       § 1.
     The executive Power shall be vested in a President of the United States of America. He shall hold his Office during the Term of four Years, and, together with the Vice President, chosen for the same Term, be elected, as follows
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Each State shall appoint, in such Manner as the Legislature thereof may direct, a Number of Electors, equal to the whole Number of Senators and Representatives to which the State may be entitled in the Congress: but no Senator or Representative, or Person holding an Office of Trust or Profit under the United States, shall be appointed an Elector.
     </p>
     <p>
      [The Electors shall meet in their respective States, and vote by Ballot for two Persons, of whom one at least shall not be an Inhabitant of the same State with themselves. And they shall make a List of all the Persons voted for, and of the Number of Votes for each; which List they shall sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the Seat of the Government of the United States, directed to the President of the Senate. The President of the Senate shall, in the Presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the Certificates, and the Votes shall then be counted. The Person having the greatest Number of Votes shall be the President, if such Number be a Majority of the whole Number of Electors appointed; and if there be more than one who have such Majority, and have an equal Number of Votes, then the House of Representatives shall immediately chuse by Ballot one of them for President; and if no Person have a Majority, then from the five highest on the List the said House shall in like Manner chuse the President. But in chusing the President, the Votes shall be taken by States, the Representation from each State having one Vote; A quorum for this Purpose shall consist of a Member or Members from two thirds of the States, and a Majority of all the States shall be necessary to a Choice. In every Case, after the Choice of the President, the Person having the greatest Number of Votes of the Electors shall be the Vice President. But if there should remain two or more who have equal Votes, the Senate shall chuse from them by Ballot the Vice-President.]
     </p>
     <p>
      The Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors, and the Day on which they shall give their Votes; which Day shall be the same throughout the United States.
     </p>
     <p>
      No Person except a natural born Citizen or a Citizen of the United States, at the time of the Adoption of this Constitution, shall be eligible to the Office of President; neither shall any Person be eligible to that Office who shall not have attained to the Age of thirty five Years, and been fourteen Years a Resident within the United States.
     </p>
     <p>
      In Case of the Removal of the President from Office, or of his Death, Resignation, or inability to discharge the Powers and Duties of the said Office, the Same shall devolve on the Vice President, and the Congress may by Law provide for the Case of Removal, Death, Resignation or Inability, both of the President and Vice President, declaring what Officer shall then act as President, and such Officer shall act accordingly, until the Disability be removed, or a President shall be elected.
     </p>
     <p>
      The President shall, at stated Times, receive for his Services, a Compensation, which shall neither be encreased nor diminished during the Period for which he shall have been elected, and he shall not receive within that Period any other Emolument from the United States, or any of them.
     </p>

      Before he enter on the Execution of his Office, he shall take the following Oath of Affirmation: -

        The case-or-controversy requirement of Article III incorporates the doctrines of standing, mootness, ripeness, and political question, all of which help define and limit the role of the courts to ensure proper balance among the three branches of government. Brigham v. State, 179 Vt. 525, 889 A.2d 715 (mem.) (September 12, 2005).

        Plaintiffs bringing pre-enforcement facial challenge against statute need not demonstrate to a certainty that they will be prosecuted under statute to show injury, but only that they have an actual and well-founded fear that law will be enforced against them. Landell v. Sorrell, 382 F.2d 91 (2d Cir. 2004), rev'd on other grounds sub nom. Randall v. Sorrell, 548 U.S. 230 (2006) (issue not raised on appeal).

         7. Judicial restraint.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        One of the passive virtues of the standing doctrine and case-or-controversy requirements is to promote judicial restraint by limiting the occasions for judicial intervention into the political process. Thus, for a court to maintain its proper role among the three branches of government, it must exercise judicial restraint by not asserting jurisdiction over claims that are moot or not yet ripe, or that pose a political question. Brigham v. State, 179 Vt. 525, 889 A.2d 715 (mem.) (September 12, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prudential judicial restraint in and of itself does not excuse the court from its duty to uphold the constitution. Brigham v. State, 179 Vt. 525, 889 A.2d 715 (mem.) (September 12, 2005).

         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         Issue of subject matter jurisdiction was sufficiently litigated that the court had to afford Oklahoma's determination in a child support proceeding full faith and credit. The mother was a party in the Oklahoma action, and she raised the issue of subject matter jurisdiction in that proceeding. OCS/Pappas v. O'Brien, 193 Vt. 340, 67 A.3d 916 (2013).
        </p>
        <p>
         Mother had thoroughly litigated the issue of personal jurisdiction in a child support proceeding in Oklahoma and could not, whatever the merits, relitigate it here. Even on jurisdictional questions, another state's judgments might have preclusive effect under the Full Faith and Credit Clause. OCS/Pappas v. O'Brien, 193 Vt. 340, 67 A.3d 916 (2013).
        </p>
        <p>
         Neither comity nor constitutional principles of full faith and credit required family court to decline modification of New York child support order since, when both parties to decree, as well as child, all moved to Vermont, Vermont's courts became responsible for welfare of child, and New York no longer had legitimate interest in relationship. Cavallari v. Martin, 169 Vt. 210, 732 A.2d 739 (1999).
        </p>
        <p>
         This section applies to the records and judicial proceedings of courts only so far as they have jurisdiction. In re Hanrahan's Will, 109 Vt. 108, 194 A. 471 (1937).
        </p>
        <p>
         Rule that, notwithstanding this section, jurisdiction of the court by which a judgment is rendered in any state may be questioned in a collateral proceeding in another state, applies even when the inquiry necessitates disputing jurisdictional facts positively asserted in the judgment record. Solomon v. Atlantis Development, Inc., 145 Vt. 70, 483 A.2d 253 (1984).
        </p>
        <p>
         This section makes record of judgment rendered in court of one state conclusive evidence in courts of another state of matter adjudged, but does not preclude inquiry into jurisdiction of court rendering judgment over subject matter or parties affected by it, or into facts necessary to give such jurisdiction. Bristol v. Noyes, 106 Vt. 418, 174 A. 924 (1934).
        </p>
        <p>
         This section does not prevent an inquiry into the jurisdiction of a court of another state, a judgment of which is offered in evidence. Wood v. Augustins, 70 Vt. 637, 41 A. 583 (1898); Domenchini's Administrator v. Hoosac Tunnel & Wilmington Railroad, 90 Vt. 451, 98 A. 982 (1916).
        </p>
        <p>
         When offered in evidence, the record of a judgment rendered in another state may be contradicted as to the facts necessary to give the court jurisdiction, either as to the subject matter or the person, and, if it be shown that such facts did not exist, the record will be a nullity, notwithstanding it may recite that they did exist. Wood v. Augustins, 70 Vt. 637, 41 A. 583 (1898).
        </p>
        <p>
         While full credit is to be given to the judgments of a sister state, whether the court rendering such judgment had jurisdiction is always open to inquiry. Betts v. Johnson, 68 Vt. 549, 35 A. 489 (1896).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where judgment is rendered in another state against a nonresident thereof, without process or notice being served upon him in the state where the judgment is rendered, and he does not submit to jurisdiction by appearing in the suit, it is of no validity when sought to be enforced by action in another state under this section. Price v. Hickok, 39 Vt. 292 (1866).
        </p>
        <p>
         A judgment rendered in another state, against a citizen of this State who was not within the jurisdiction of the court rendering the judgment, and who had no notice of the suit and did not appear, could not be enforced in this State by an action of debt upon the judgment. Newcomb v. Peck, 17 Vt. 302 (1845).
        </p>
        <p>
         A judgment rendered in one state, by a court having jurisdiction, is conclusive evidence in another. Hoxie v. Wright, 2 Vt. 263 (1828).

         A decree dismissing a suit commenced in another state is conclusive and to be given full faith and credit in a suit brought in this State on the same claim and same ground. Low v. Mussey, 41 Vt. 393 (1868).
        </p>
        <p>
         A judgment of a justice of the peace is a judicial proceeding within the meaning of this section and is conclusive upon parties and privies thereto, as to all facts adjudicated. Carpenter v. Pier, 30 Vt. 81 (1858).
        </p>
        <p>
         A judgment rendered in one state by a court having jurisdiction of the suit will operate as a merger of the cause of action and be a bar to the further prosecution of a suit in another state between the same parties and upon the same claim.

          6. Divorce.
         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         The Full Faith and Credit Clause of the United States Constitution does not apply to judgments obtained in a foreign country, and so a United States court may, but is not required to, recognize a divorce decree from a foreign country under the doctrine of comity. Adams v. Adams, 177 Vt. 448, 869 A.2d 124 (January 14, 2005).
        </p>
        <p>
         Full faith and credit of a foreign divorce judgment is conclusive in Vermont only if there was jurisdiction to render the judgment. Poston v. Poston, 160 Vt. 1, 624 A.2d 853 (1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 816, 114 S. Ct. 66, 126 L. Ed. 2d 35 (1993).
        </p>
        <p>
         Under the doctrine of divisible divorce, issues other than the dissolution of the marriage are severed from the divorce action when the court does not have personal jurisdiction over one spouse; in that case, the judgment does not resolve issues other than the marital status of the parties. Poston v. Poston, 160 Vt. 1, 624 A.2d 853 (1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 816, 114 S. Ct. 66, 126 L. Ed. 2d 35 (1993).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where Texas court lacked jurisdiction to determine wife's rights, its judgment was not given binding effect, beyond the dissolution of the parties' marriage. Poston v. Poston, 160 Vt. 1, 624 A.2d 853 (1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 816, 114 S. Ct. 66, 126 L. Ed. 2d 35 (1993).
        </p>
        <p>
         Under this section and its implementing statute, a final decree of divorce rendered in one state must be given the same validity and effect in Vermont as given in the state in which it was entered, providing the jurisdictional requirements are satisfied. Taddeo v. Taddeo, 141 Vt. 120, 446 A.2d 360 (1982).
        </p>
        <p>
         This section precludes a party who has appeared in a foreign divorce proceeding, without questioning jurisdiction, or one who has been served with process within the foreign state, from attacking the judgment in the courts of a sister state. Cook v. Cook, 117 Vt. 173, 86 A.2d 923 (1952); In re Estate of Shufelt, 125 Vt. 131, 211 A.2d 173 (1965).
        </p>
        <p>
         This section does not bar relitigation of the issue of domicile as the jurisdictional basis of an ex parte divorce. Walker v. Walker, 124 Vt. 172, 200 A.2d 267 (1964).
        </p>
        <p>
         This section does not require a state to give more credit to a divorce decree than it had where rendered. Miller v. Miller, 123 Vt. 221, 186 A.2d 93 (1962).
        </p>
        <p>
         This section requires extraterritorial recognition of validity of divorce decree obtained in accordance with requirements of procedural due process in state by the spouse who under law of such state had acquired bona fide domicile there, although the spouse who remained in state of original matrimonial domicile did not appear in divorce suit and was not served with process in state in which divorce was granted. Loeb v. Loeb, 118 Vt. 472, 114 A.2d 518 (1955).
        </p>
        <p>
         When the petitionee in a divorce case appears, and has the opportunity to contest the jurisdiction but does not do so, or when the petitionee has been personally served with process in the state and the proceedings may not be attacked on jurisdictional grounds by the parties who were actually before the court or by their privies or by strangers in the courts of the state in which the divorce was rendered, this section precludes their attacking it in the courts of a sister state. Cook v. Cook, 117 Vt. 173, 86 A.2d 923 (1952).
        </p>
        <p>
         This section does not require courts of one state to give effect to decree of divorce rendered by court of another state, even though decree is valid there, but was rendered without appearance of libelee or personal service on him within that jurisdiction. Blondin v. Brooks, 83 Vt. 472, 76 A. 184 (1910).

         First Amendment embraces an absolute freedom to believe; protection of freedom to act, however, remains subject to regulation for protection of society, and conduct that violates important social duties or is subversive of good order may be regulated without impinging on First Amendment rights.

          2. Privileges and immunities.

        </h5>
        <p>
         Before the Supreme Court may apply the Privileges and Immunities Clause of this section to a statute, it must first decide whether the statute burdens one of those privileges and immunities protected by the clause. Leverson v. Conway, 144 Vt. 523, 481 A.2d 1029 (1984), appeal dismissed, 469 U.S. 926, 105 S. Ct. 316, 83 L. Ed. 2d 255 (1984), vacated and remanded, 472 U.S. 1014, 105 S. Ct. 3471, 87 L. Ed. 2d 608 (1985).
        </p>
        <p>
         Only with respect to those privileges and immunities bearing upon the vitality of the nation as a single entity must the State treat all citizens, resident and nonresident, equally. Leverson v. Conway, 144 Vt. 523, 481 A.2d 1029 (1984), appeal dismissed, 469 U.S. 926, 105 S. Ct. 316, 83 L. Ed. 2d 255 (1984), vacated and remanded, 472 U.S. 1014, 105 S. Ct. 3471, 87 L. Ed. 2d 608 (1985).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where plaintiff purchased an automobile while residing in Wisconsin and paid a sales tax to that state, requirement that he pay a use tax as a condition of registering the vehicle in Vermont did not violate the Privileges and Immunities Clause of this section by infringing plaintiff 's right to travel, since plaintiff suffered no restrictions on his right to travel in Vermont and incurred no penalty as a result of the exercise of that right, plaintiff was free to bring the automobile to Vermont, and plaintiff 's right to register the vehicle, which triggered the use tax obligation, did not implicate the fundamental right to travel. Leverson v. Conway, 144 Vt. 523, 481 A.2d 1029 (1984), appeal dismissed, 469 U.S. 926, 105 S. Ct. 316, 83 L. Ed. 2d 255 (1984), vacated and remanded, 472 U.S. 1014, 105 S. Ct. 3471, 87 L. Ed. 2d 608 (1985).
        </p>
        <p>
         To show a violation of the Privileges and Immunities Clause of this section, nonresident taxpayer has burden to demonstrate discrimination to the extent that it is arbitrary and unreasonable, and to show such discrimination, taxpayer must first demonstrate that he is disadvantaged compared to another in an equivalent position. Wheeler v. State, 127 Vt. 361, 249 A.2d 887 (1969), appeal dismissed, 396 U.S. 4, 90 S. Ct. 24, 24 L. Ed. 2d 4 (1969).
        </p>
        <p>
         Taxation of nonresident's adjusted gross income earned in Vermont is not discriminatory so as to violate Privileges and Immunities Clause of this section, even though nonresident taxpayer with income from sources outside Vermont would pay at higher rate than resident taxpayer with equivalent income from Vermont but without income from other sources. Wheeler v. State, 127 Vt. 361, 249 A.2d 887 (1969), appeal dismissed, 396 U.S. 4, 90 S. Ct. 24, 24 L. Ed. 2d 4 (1969).
        </p>
        <p>
         Corporations are not citizens within the meaning of the Privileges and Immunities Clause of this section. Hawley v. Hurd, 72 Vt. 122, 47 A. 401 (1900); Cook v. Howland, 74 Vt. 393, 52 A. 973 (1902).
        </p>
        <p>
         Refusal of license to nonresident to transact insurance business in this State as agent of a foreign insurance corporation does not deprive him of rights guaranteed by the Privileges and Immunities Clause of this section, since a corporation is not a citizen within the meaning of the clause, and the State therefore has the right to impose conditions on foreign corporations doing business in the State, including a condition whereby a corporation is licensed to conduct business by resident agents only. Cook v. Howland, 74 Vt. 393, 52 A. 973 (1902).
        </p>
        <p>
         Statute denying to nonresidents rights allowed to residents, under same circumstances, in respect to deductions from taxable personal property by reason of debts owed by taxpayer, conflicts with this section. Sprague v. Fletcher, 69 Vt. 69, 37 A. 239 (1896); Hughes v. Kelley, 69 Vt. 443, 38 A. 91 (1897).

        <p>
         In extraditions, although a warrant from demanding state's governor is prima facie evidence that constitutional and statutory requirements are met, and computations of the petitioner's sentence are demanding state's responsibility, asylum state must examine warrant's supporting documents to see whether they support or rebut prima facie case. In re Ladd, 157 Vt. 270, 596 A.2d 1313 (1991).
        </p>
        <p>
         Clause 2 of this section required honoring of extradition warrant, despite petitioner's claim that he was illegally detained, since any irregularities in prerequisition detention were no bar to extradition once a rendition warrant was issued and received. In re Lovejoy, 150 Vt. 588, 556 A.2d 79 (1988).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where copy of Rhode Island judgment and disposition which was complete on its face constituted adequate proof that petitioner was in Rhode Island at the time of the commission of the alleged crime, and that document, read together with requisition warrant itself and affidavit of petitioner's probation officer answered claim that petitioner was not a fugitive from Rhode Island, petitioner was properly sought for extradition. In re Hval, 149 Vt. 58, 539 A.2d 537 (1987).
        </p>
        <p>
         Clause of this section relative to the surrender of fugitives from justice by the state applies to one who has been indicted for obtaining money or property under false pretenses in a state which has made that offense a crime by statute. In re Greenough, 31 Vt. 279 (1858).

      2. Preemption of state law by federal law.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulatory statement regarding preemption deserved no deference, as Congress intended the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act to preempt only those state laws that would make it impossible
    for manufacturers to comply with both federal and state requirements, which was not the case here. Moreover, even if the statement did alter a regulation allowing drug manufacturers to add or strengthen a warning to increase the safe use of the drug product without prior FDA approval, the change did not take effect until June 2006; without such a change, it was possible for manufacturers to comply with both FDA regulations and duties imposed by state common law, and there was no direct and positive conflict between state and federal law. Levine v. Wyeth, 183 Vt. 76, 944 A.2d 179 (Oct. 27, 2006), cert granted, 128 S. Ct. 1118, 169 L. Ed. 2d 845, 2008 U.S. LEXIS 1100, 76 U.S.L.W. 3391 (U.S. 2008); aff'd, 2009 U.S. LEXIS 1774 (U.S. 2009).
    </p>
    <p>
     United States Supreme Court's decision in
     <i>
      Geier
     </i>
     does state that implied preemption applies even when a statute addresses preemption expressly, but it does not allow courts or agencies to preempt state laws that have been expressly preserved by Congress. Levine v. Wyeth, 183 Vt. 76, 944 A.2d 179 (Oct. 27, 2006), cert granted, 128 S. Ct. 1118, 169 L. Ed. 2d 845, 2008 U.S. LEXIS 1100, 76 U.S.L.W. 3391 (U.S. 2008); aff'd, 2009 U.S. LEXIS 1774 (U.S. 2009).
    </p>
    <p>
     United States Supreme Court's decision in
     <i>
      Geier
     </i>
     simply stands for the proposition that Congress's intent not to preempt a provision of state law cannot be inferred from either (1) an express preemption clause that does not include the state law in question in its scope, or (2) a clause that prevents regulated entities from using compliance with federal law as a defense in state common-law suits. According to
     <i>
      Geier,
     </i>
     the former clause does not support a negative inference that Congress must have intended to preserve laws it did not expressly preempt; the latter indicates only that Congress intended to preserve some common-law claims, not that it intended to allow even claims that conflict with federal requirements. Levine v. Wyeth, 183 Vt. 76, 944 A.2d 179 (Oct. 27, 2006), cert granted, 128 S. Ct. 1118, 169 L. Ed. 2d 845, 2008 U.S. LEXIS 1100, 76 U.S.L.W. 3391 (U.S. 2008); aff'd, 2009 U.S. LEXIS 1774 (U.S. 2009).
    </p>
    <p>
     When the court was not attempting to infer the effect of statutory language that only indirectly addresses the specific state law at issue, but interpreting an unambiguous express preemption clause that specifically preserved the type of state law at issue, ordinary preemption principles had to give way to Congress's intent to preserve state laws that did not create a direct and positive conflict with federal law. There was no such conflict; accordingly, a Food and Drug Administration regulatory statement regarding preemption was neither an authoritative interpretation of an ambiguous statutory provision entitled to deference, nor a persuasive policy statement entitled to respect. Levine v. Wyeth, 183 Vt. 76, 944 A.2d 179 (Oct. 27, 2006), cert granted, 128 S. Ct. 1118, 169 L. Ed. 2d 845, 2008 U.S. LEXIS 1100, 76 U.S.L.W. 3391 (U.S. 2008); aff'd, 2009 U.S. LEXIS 1774 (U.S. 2009).
    </p>
    <p>
     Food and Drug Administration approval of a drug's label does not preempt state failure-to-warn claims. Levine v. Wyeth, 183 Vt. 76, 944 A.2d 179 (Oct. 27, 2006), cert granted, 128 S. Ct. 1118, 169 L. Ed. 2d 845, 2008 U.S. LEXIS 1100, 76 U.S.L.W. 3391 (U.S. 2008); aff'd, 2009 U.S. LEXIS 1774 (U.S. 2009).
    </p>
    <p>
     State failure-to-warn claims are generally not preempted by federal drug labeling requirements. Levine v. Wyeth, 183 Vt. 76, 944 A.2d 179 (Oct. 27, 2006), cert granted, 128 S. Ct. 1118, 169 L. Ed. 2d 845, 2008 U.S. LEXIS 1100, 76 U.S.L.W. 3391 (U.S. 2008); aff'd, 2009 U.S. LEXIS 1774 (U.S. 2009).
    </p>
    <p>
     With regard to defendant's claim that a failure-to-warn claim was preempted because it was impossible to comply with both State and federal law, the court rejected defendant's argument that it would have been prosecuted for "misbranding" if it had strengthened the label on its drug without prior approval. The validity and authority of State law does not depend on speculative hypotheticals regarding assumptions of what the Food and Drug Administration would have done in response to a stronger warning. Levine v. Wyeth, 183 Vt. 76, 944 A.2d 179 (Oct. 27, 2006), cert granted, 128 S. Ct. 1118, 169 L. Ed. 2d 845, 2008 U.S. LEXIS 1100, 76 U.S.L.W. 3391 (U.S. 2008); aff'd, 2009 U.S. LEXIS 1774 (U.S. 2009).
    </p>
    <p>
     Congress intended that the Food, Drug and Cosmetics Act (FDCA) would leave state law in place except where it created a direct and positive conflict between state and federal law. It simply restated the principle that state
    law is superseded in cases of an actual conflict with federal law such that compliance with both federal and state regulations is a physical impossibility; in other words, under any circumstances where it is possible to comply with both state law and the FDCA, the state law in question is consistent with the
    purposes and objectives of Congress. Levine v. Wyeth, 183 Vt. 76, 944 A.2d 179 (Oct. 27, 2006), cert granted, 128 S. Ct. 1118, 169 L. Ed. 2d 845, 2008 U.S. LEXIS 1100, 76 U.S.L.W. 3391 (U.S. 2008); aff'd, 2009 U.S. LEXIS 1774 (U.S. 2009).
    </p>
    <p>
     When defendant asserted that plaintiff's tort action actually conflicted with federal law, it was required to show either that it was impossible for a private party to comply with both State and federal requirements or that Vermont's common law stood as an obstacle to the accomplishment and execution of the full purposes and objectives of Congress. Levine v. Wyeth, 183 Vt. 76, 944 A.2d 179 (Oct. 27, 2006), cert granted, 128 S. Ct. 1118, 169 L.

     Although federal government preempted certain aspects of aircraft and airport operation, it did not pervasively occupy field of land-use regulations relating to aviation, and therefore application of Act 250 to appellant's airport was not preempted by federal law.

     Federal bankruptcy code preempted State tort claims alleging violations of automatic stay in bankruptcy, and therefore district court properly held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to review claims.

      1. Generally.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     First Amendment embraces an absolute freedom to believe; protection of freedom to act, however, remains subject to regulation for protection of society, and conduct that violates important social duties or is subversive of good order may be regulated without impinging on First Amendment rights. Barquin v. Roman Catholic Diocese of Burlington, Vt., Inc., 839 F. Supp. 275 (D. Vt. 1993).

     <b>
      2. Standards for review.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     Probation conditions that unquestionably restrict otherwise inviolable constitutional rights may properly be subject to special scrutiny to determine whether the limitations do in fact serve the dual objectives of rehabilitation and public safety. State v. Emery, 156 Vt. 364, 593 A.2d 77 (1991).
    </p>
    <p>
     Where no plain error was found in trial court's revocation of probation on basis that defendant failed to successfully complete sexual therapy program, claim that requiring defendant to admit having had sexual intercourse with his stepdaughter infringed upon his First Amendment rights first raised on appeal was not preserved for review. State v. Mace, 154 Vt. 430, 578 A.2d 104 (1990).
    </p>
    <p>
     A party asserting a violation of the First Amendment has the initial burden of proving that the State requirement or restriction imposes a burden on religious belief or practice. State v. DeLaBruere, 154 Vt. 237, 577 A.2d 254 (1990).
    </p>
    <p>
     In considering question of abridgement of freedom of speech, religion, and press under this amendment, an ordinance must be tested by its operation and effect rather than its form. State v. Greaves, 112 Vt. 222, 22 A.2d 497 (1941).

     There was no excessive entanglement with regard to plaintiff's claims that defendant diocese negligently hired, trained, supervised, and retained a priest who sexually abused him. The negligence claim was not measured against canon law, but rather against secular legal standards; common law, not ecclesiastical principles, established the scope of defendant's duty; and the duty owed by defendant to protect minors from sexual abuse was not different from the duty owed by other institutions to which the common law applied.

     Plaintiff's claims that defendant diocese negligently hired, trained, supervised, and retained a priest who sexually abused him did not violate the Free Exercise Clause; defendant did not argue that the common law of negligence was something other than a neutral law of general applicability or that it was directed specifically toward a religious belief or practice of defendant, nor had defendant identified a specific doctrine or practice that would be burdened if plaintiff's suit went forward. The court did not believe defendant's generalized assertion that requiring it to hire and supervise priests in a nonnegligent manner would constitute undue interference in church governance.

     Public forum doctrine did not give right to display religious symbol in city hall park where city had not created a forum in park open to the unattended, solitary display of religious symbols, and in any case the existence of a public forum is merely one factor in determining whether the context of a display suggests government endorsement.

     State could validly prosecute parents for truancy of child enrolled in religious school that did not meet statutory private school reporting requirements; in their First Amendment challenge to the reporting statute, parents had emphasized the unity of interest of the church and the parents, and nothing in the record suggested church could not change its policies to comply with the statute or that parents could not control church policy, and parents made no attempt to reconcile the conflict between State requirements and church policy.

     "Revenge porn" does not fall within an established categorical exception to full First Amendment protection, and the Vermont Supreme Court declines to predict that the United States Supreme Court would recognize a new category. However, the Vermont statute banning disclosure of nonconsensual pornography or "revenge porn" survives strict scrutiny as the United States Supreme Court has applied that standard. State v. Vanburen, 210 Vt. 293, 214 A.3d 791 (2019).
    </p>
    <p>
     Given the ill fit between nonconsensual pornography and obscenity, and the United States Supreme Court's reluctance to expand the contours of the category of obscenity, the speech restricted by Vermont's "revenge porn" statute cannot be fairly categorized as constitutionally unprotected obscenity. State v. Vanburen, 210 Vt. 293, 214 A.3d 791 (2019).

     Statute banning disclosure of nonconsensual pornography or "revenge porn" is narrowly tailored to advance the State's interests, does not penalize more speech than necessary to accomplish its aim, and does not risk chilling protected speech on matters of public concern.

     The 2015 version of the criminal stalking statute did not violate the First Amendment as applied to defendant. A trier of fact could find that, in the context of defendant's overall course of conduct as well as the specific context of the book he disseminated near the complainant's workplace, the statement in the book "Shoot the terrorist? Or shoot the 'artist?' Neither are present" would cause a reasonable person to fear unlawful violence. State v. Noll, 208 Vt. 474, 199 A.3d 1054 (2018).
    </p>
    <p>
     The 2015 version of the criminal stalking statute was facially constitutional. "True threats" are not constitutionally protected, and the expression potentially targeted by the statute's definition of "harassing" consisted primarily, if not completely, of true threats; moreover, the statute's application to only those threats that reasonably cause substantial emotional distress did not offend the First Amendment.

     Statutory text of the portion of the disorderly conduct statute pertaining to disturbing any lawful assembly or meeting treats brief outbursts of speech - the content of which may merely be objectionable to the sensibilities of some (or all) of those assembled - the same as prolonged, voluminous speech that, for example, drowns out the primary speaker, preventing audience members from hearing the speaker. If the court were to apply this statute according to its terms, it would criminalize heckling, interrupting, harsh questioning, booing, and all manner of speech that has been tolerated pursuant to the rights accorded to the peoples of free societies; thus, the statute, as worded, impermissibly sanctions a substantial amount of protected speech even when considered in relation to its legitimate scope. State v. Colby, 185 Vt. 464, 972 A.2d 197 (2009).
    </p>
    <p>
     Central constitutional tension presented by the disorderly conduct statute pertaining to disturbing any lawful assembly or meeting arises from a clash of two fundamental First Amendment rights - freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. In construing the statute, the court must ensure that neither fundamental right is unnecessarily sacrificed for the sake of the other. State v. Colby, 185 Vt. 464, 972 A.2d 197 (2009).
    </p>
    <p>
     To show that a defendant violated the disorderly conduct statute pertaining to disturbing any lawful assembly or meeting, the State must prove that a defendant's conduct -
    and not the content of the activity's expression - substantially impaired the effective conduct of a meeting. Narrowing the reach of the statute in such a fashion strikes the proper balance between the two fundamental rights implicated by the statute, freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. State v. Colby, 185 Vt. 464, 972 A.2d 197 (2009).

     Defendants' actions did not substantially impair the effective conduct of a commencement ceremony when a speech was interrupted for less than thirty seconds by defendants' remarks; one defendant was in the process of leaving the ceremony voluntarily when he was apprehended; and both defendants left the site of the ceremony upon being asked and without further incident. Such de minimis disturbances, even if rude and out of place in the context of a commencement ceremony, could not serve as the basis for criminal liability without running afoul of the First Amendment.

     The punitive purpose of criminal proceedings raises issues under this amendment supporting the right to public access that are not present in juvenile proceedings, since in criminal proceedings public access serves as a check against factors that are not involved in juvenile proceedings: unjust conviction, excessive punishment, and, when confidential, the undeserved taint of criminality.

This conclusion is not affected by the fact that some information contained in a PSI may become public during the sentencing process, as the documents themselves have been, and continue to be, treated as confidential. Much information contained in PSIs, including that provided by defendants themselves, remains private. State v. LaBounty, 167 Vt. 25, 702 A.2d 82 (1997).
    </p>
    <p>
     Pretrial criminal proceedings and documents are presumably open to the public, closure being the exception rather than the rule. State v. Tallman, 148 Vt. 465, 537 A.2d 422 (1987).
    </p>
    <p>
     To rebut the presumption that pretrial criminal proceedings and documents are open to the public, party seeking closure must demonstrate that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest. State v. Tallman, 148 Vt. 465, 537 A.2d 422 (1987).
    </p>
    <p>
     The right of access to pretrial proceedings and documents is not an absolute right, especially when defendant's Sixth Amendment right to trial by an impartial jury might be jeopardized by public disclosures prior to trial. State v. Tallman, 148 Vt. 465, 537 A.2d 422 (1987).
    </p>
    <p>
     Direct intervention in a trial court proceeding is an appropriate legal vehicle for ensuring that the news media's voice is heard in a timely manner; therefore, news media has limited standing to intervene upon a criminal defendant's motion to seal affidavits of probable cause or to close a pretrial suppression hearing. State v. Tallman, 148 Vt. 465, 537 A.2d 422 (1987).
    </p>
    <p>
     Members of the public and representatives of the news media have a right of access to pretrial suppression hearings under this amendment. State v. Tallman, 148 Vt. 465, 537 A.2d 422 (1987).
    </p>
    <p>
     After it has been reviewed by a court, an affidavit of probable cause becomes a public document. State v. Tallman, 148 Vt. 465, 537 A.2d 422 (1987).
    </p>
    <p>
     A court can temporarily seal an affidavit of probable cause upon a preliminary examination of the likelihood of adverse publicity and its potential effect on the accused's right to a fair trial; however, such an order must be carefully drawn to afford the maximum recognition of the rights of both the defendant and the public. State v. Tallman, 148 Vt. 465, 537 A.2d 422 (1987).
    </p>
    <p>
     The press and public have a qualified right of access to affidavits of probable cause, which must be balanced with defendant's Sixth Amendment right to a fair trial. Greenwood v. Wolchik, 149 Vt. 441, 544 A.2d 1156 (1988).
    </p>
    <p>
     At least with respect to affidavits of probable cause, this amendment creates a qualified right of access to most pretrial documents as well as to pretrial court proceedings. State v. Schaefer, 157 Vt. 339, 599 A.2d 337, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 1077, 112 S. Ct. 981, 117 L. Ed. 2d 144 (1991).
    </p>
    <p>
     A two-step analysis is applied in determining the public right of access to preliminary criminal proceedings: first, trial court must determine whether First Amendment right of access extends to the judicial proceeding or document at issue; and second, if the court finds that such a right of access attaches, it must determine whether nondisclosure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest. State v. Densmore, 160 Vt. 131, 624 A.2d 1138 (1993).

    <p>
     Permitting recovery of presumed and punitive damages in defamation cases absent a showing of "actual malice" does not violate this amendment when the defamatory statements do not involve matters of public concern. Dun & Bradstreet, Inc. v. Greenmoss Builders, Inc., 472 U.S. 749, 105 S. Ct. 2939, 86 L. Ed. 2d 593 (1985).

     Where remarks attributed to defendant in libel action were clearly hyperbole, publication of the remarks was protected by this amendment. Blouin v. Anton, 139 Vt. 618, 431 A.2d 489 (1981).
    </p>
    <p>
     In a defamation action where there was no claim that plaintiff was a public official or public figure, plaintiff did not have to prove constitutional or actual malice to establish defendant's liability. Ryan v. Herald Association, 152 Vt. 275, 566 A.2d 1316 (1989).
    </p>
    <p>
     In defamation action brought by private individual, if plaintiff proved that defendant's fault rose to the level of constitutional malice, then actual damages were presumed and punitive damages could be recovered upon a showing of common-law malice. Ryan v. Herald Association, 152 Vt. 275, 566 A.2d 1316 (1989).

     Vermont filing deadline for candidates applies equally to all candidates and does not place independents at a particular disadvantage for accessing the ballot; rather, the registration deadline is a reasonable, nondiscriminatory regulation that imposes at most a minor burden on plaintiffs' rights.

     In extending criminal liability to someone who knowingly solicits, lures, or entices, or attempts to solicit, lure, or entice, a child under 16 years of age - or another person believed to be a child under that age - to commit such an act or engage in such conduct, the Legislature criminalized speech integral to criminal conduct.

     Use of kidnapping defendant's photograph in array with photographs of other suspects, where photograph had been improperly retained by authorities from an earlier investigation of unrelated charges, was not a "seizure" deserving of the special protections provided by this amendment. United States v. Jakobetz, 955 F.2d 786 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 834, 113 S. Ct. 104, 121 L. Ed. 2d 63 (1992).
    </p>
    <p>
     Although the core value of the privacy right protected by both the Vermont and federal Constitutions is the right to be free from unreasonable government intrusions into legitimate expectations of privacy, Vermont jurisprudence has diverged from the United States Supreme Court's analysis. State v. Welch, 160 Vt. 70, 624 A.2d 1105 (1992).
    </p>
    <p>
     A reasonable expectation of privacy, and not common law property distinctions, controls the scope of this amendment. State v. Pike, 143 Vt. 283, 465 A.2d 1348 (1983).

     In the context of a shared student apartment, it is not unusual for persons thrown together by a tight housing market to knowingly tolerate casual drug use on the part of their roommates, even though they themselves may not use drugs. Thus, probable cause to overcome defendant's individual privacy interest in his locked bedroom cannot be based solely on the allegation that he had knowledge that marijuana had been used in the living room of the apartment he shared with two other students. s State v. Quigley, 179 Vt. 567, 892 A.2d 211 (mem.) (December 15, 2005).
    </p>
    <p>
     Seizure of a bag of marijuana found in defendant's vehicle when defendant was pulled over for driving under the influence, which was lawful under the plain-view exception to the warrant requirement since the officer viewed the partially exposed baggie while lawfully reaching inside the vehicle to seize an open beer can and had probable cause to believe the baggie contained contraband, infringed on no privacy or possessory interests. State v. Trudeau, 165 Vt. 355, 683 A.2d 725 (1996).
    </p>
    <p>
     Because no protected privacy interest remains in contraband in a container once government officers lawfully have opened that container and identified its contents as illegal, once customs agents had lawfully opened defendant's luggage and discovered marijuana, defendant lost any privacy interest in the contents of his luggage, and the resealing of his luggage for shipment to Vermont did not revive his privacy interest. State v. Coburn, 165 Vt. 318, 683 A.2d 1343 (1996).
    </p>
    <p>
     Since paramount concern in search and seizure cases is to give effect to core values of privacy underlying provision of Vermont Constitution, Vermont Supreme Court does not hesitate to depart from parallel federal law when necessary to accomplish this goal. State v. Rogers, 161 Vt. 236, 638 A.2d 569 (1993).
    </p>
    <p>
     Under this amendment, an individual must demonstrate a legitimate expectation of privacy in the place searched or the items seized before the court will consider whether the search was unreasonable. State v. Welch, 160 Vt. 70, 624 A.2d 1105 (1992).
    </p>
    <p>
     While individuals have a reduced expectation of privacy when in an automobile on a public highway, an individual operating an automobile does not lose all reasonable expectation of privacy simply because the automobile and its use are subject to government regulation.

     Vantage point five to ten feet from defendant's lawn in woods behind defendant's house was not within protected curtilage area of defendant's home, and where no signs or other methods were used to indicate that defendant sought to exclude public, defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy regarding spot from which officer viewed marijuana plant. State v. Hall, 168 Vt. 327, 719 A.2d 435 (1998).

    <p>
     Curtilage is an area outside physical confines of a house into which privacies of life may extend, and which receives the same constitutional protection from unreasonable searches and seizures as the home itself. State v. Rogers, 161 Vt. 236, 638 A.2d 569 (1993).
    </p>
    <p>
     Finding that garden was within curtilage of home was reasonable and clearly supported by credible evidence even though garden was separated from home by distance of 150 feet, pond, and small private bridge since both house and garden were surrounded by thickly wooded band of property that served as natural enclosure substantially shielding garden from view of normal passersby, home was not an urban residence for which privacy expectations were reduced exponentially as distance from home increases, and presence of topographical features did not provide any significant sense of separation between house and garden. State v. Rogers, 161 Vt. 236, 638 A.2d 569 (1993).
    </p>
    <p>
     Trooper's observation of garden area was not a search requiring a warrant regardless of whether garden laid within curtilage. State v. Rogers, 161 Vt. 236, 638 A.2d 569 (1993).
    </p>
    <p>
     When State officials come onto private property to conduct an investigation, observations made from a vantage point on an access area that visitors could be expected to use are not protected by this amendment. State v. Byrne, 149 Vt. 224, 542 A.2d 276 (1988).
    </p>
    <p>
     Warrantless search and seizure of evidence discovered by fish and game wardens on a walkway and set of steps that led from the street to a door of defendant's residence did not violate this amendment, since the walkway and steps were used to provide access to defendant's home from the street. State v. Byrne, 149 Vt. 224, 542 A.2d 276 (1988).
    </p>
    <p>
     A judicial warrant authorizing search of a particular residence extends by implication to areas within the curtilage of that residence. State v. Potter, 148 Vt. 53, 529 A.2d 163 (1987).
    </p>
    <p>
     Shed located approximately fifteen feet from residence and used for storing family property was part of the curtilage of the house and, therefore, within scope of warrant authorizing search of the residence. State v. Potter, 148 Vt. 53, 529 A.2d 163 (1987).
    </p>
    <p>
     A driveway, as that portion of the curtilage which is the normal route of access for anyone visiting the premises, is only a semiprivate area; thus, when State officials come onto private property to conduct an investigation and restrict their movements to driveways that visitors could be expected to use, observations made from such vantage points are not covered by this amendment. State v. Pike, 143 Vt. 283, 465 A.2d 1348 (1983).
    </p>

     The curtilage is considered sufficiently within the premises to be subject to protection under this amendment. State v. Stewart, 129 Vt. 175, 274 A.2d 500 (1971).

     Where garden in which defendant cultivated marijuana was not within the area immediately surrounding defendant's home, but rather was located in a pasture across the road from his home, and more than 400 feet from the road, the garden was located in an open field and defendant had no legitimate expectation of privacy in his garden; thus, sheriff was not required to procure a warrant before entering the garden and seizing the marijuana.

     Agents of the Border Patrol engaged in roving patrols for the purpose of detecting the presence of illegal aliens in the United States may not conduct searches without probable cause; however, they may stop and detain persons for questioning about their citizenship if they have a reasonable suspicion that the persons may be illegal aliens and, to protect their own safety, may make reasonable searches for weapons if the circumstances warrant the belief by a reasonably prudent person that his safety or the safety of others is in danger. United States v. Deval, 612 F. Supp. 329 (D. Vt. 1985).

    </p>
    <p>
     When marijuana was discovered by customs agents in defendant's luggage upon his return to the country and then analyzed and tested by the Vermont State Police, the conduct of the Vermont police was a continuation of the legal conduct of customs officials, there was no break in the chain of custody, and the conduct of the police was not a second search under the Fourth Amendment.

    <p>
     Defendant was effectively seized for purposes of Fourth Amendment analysis, as well as under the Vermont Constitution, when he encountered police outside his sister's house. While the record revealed neither physical restraint nor blatantly aggressive or intimidating language, the circumstances - including the fact that the suspect was obviously followed for a substantial distance, that the taxi in which he had been riding to the house was searched, and that he was successively questioned about weapons and drugs - were precisely the kind which courts had characterized as a particularized inquiry into criminal activity that the average person would not have felt free to disregard or terminate. State v. Pitts, 186 Vt. 71, 978 A.2d 14 (2009).
    </p>
    <p>
     No Fourth Amendment search occurred when town listers encountered marijuana in the course of their examination of defendants' property for appraisal purposes; therefore, whether or not the listers were on defendants' property lawfully, evidence of defendants' possession of marijuana plants and drug paraphernalia seized under a warrant based on information supplied by the listers was admissible in prosecution for felony marijuana cultivation, and misdemeanor possession of marijuana.

     Questioning of defendant by police officer in a location known to be a place where young people use alcohol and drugs and commit vandalism was not a "seizure" as the term is used in the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution; seizure did not occur until later when officer sought to search defendant's bag and pockets, after the officer observed alcohol on the defendant's breath.

     Regardless of whether power records were properly subpoenaed, a deputy's affidavit failed to provide sufficient information to establish probable cause when it did not show that a confidential informant (CI) was an inherently credible source or that the specific information provided by the CI in this instance was credible. A search warrant was therefore invalid. State v. McManis, 188 Vt. 187, 5 A.3d 890 (2010).

     Nontestimonial identification order requiring collection of saliva from defendant's mouth did not violate Fourth Amendment, despite fact that order could be issued on showing of only reasonable suspicion, rather than probable cause, since order was an advanced judicial determination akin to a warrant, and basic elements of saliva sampling for DNA were similar to fingerprinting and did not involve serious intrusion upon personal security. In re Nontestimonial Identification Order Directed to R.H., 171 Vt. 227, 762 A.2d 1239 (2000).

     In determining probable cause, strength of nexus may be considered between defendant and crime, and where connection is strong, link between place to be searched and evidence sought, need not be as strong, if place is one over which defendant exercises control; nonetheless, there must be particular facts or logical inferences supporting conclusion that place to be searched may contain evidence. State v. Towne, 158 Vt. 607, 615 A.2d 484 (1992).

     Valid seizure of storage locker rental agreement and over 100 pounds of marijuana found in defendant's house and car provided probable cause for drug enforcement agents to obtain a warrant to search the locker, even though the period covered by the rental agreement had ended 7 months prior to the search of the locker, since one of the agents contacted the storage company and determined that defendant was still renting and had recently used the locker, and the agents knew from experience that dealers use such lockers to store drugs pending distribution.

     Magistrate could reasonably have concluded that crime of knowing receipt of sexually explicit depiction of minors has been committed and that items sought would be found in defendant's residence, to justify issuance of search warrant, where customs agents knew that packages coming to post office box were from known importers or distributors of child pornography, that children in photographs were in poses proscribed by statute, that defendant appeared to be the only one to pick up mail from box, and that those who collect child pornography keep the pornography accessible.

     Where affidavit supporting State's request for a search warrant for pharmacy records stated that defendant was a Medicaid provider under investigation for generic substitution, defendant refused to permit investigators access to his pharmacy records despite the fact that he was required by law to permit inspection and review of his documents when requested, when defendant closed his pharmacy he informed the State pharmacy board that all records had been removed to his barn, and the affidavit also stated that when defendant learned of the investigation he told a former employee that he could not remember how often he had filed the brand-name reimbursement claims for dispensations of generic drugs and that examination of the pharmacy's inventory purchases would reveal that his claims could not be supported, the evidence provided a substantial basis for trial court's finding of probable cause to believe that requested pharmacy documents existed and could be found in defendant's barn.

     In determining whether probable cause to issue a search warrant exists, the task of the issuing magistrate is simply to make a practical, common sense decision whether, given all the circumstances set forth in the affidavit before him, including the veracity and basis of knowledge of persons supplying hearsay information, there is a fair probability that contraband or evidence of a crime will be found in a particular place.

     Court declined to remove ex ante conditions on a search warrant requiring that the search be performed by third parties or trained computer personnel separate from the investigators and operating behind a firewall. Given the multiplicity and magnitude of the unanticipated injuries that might be inflicted by allowing exposure of an entire computer hard drive, it was understandable to seek precautions that might mitigate such injuries, and given that exposure of embarrassing information to a detached third party constituted a lesser injury, a search warrant requiring the use of third-party screeners was not so wholly without basis as to constitute an abuse of the judge's discretion.

    <p>
     Court declined to remove ex ante conditions on a search warrant limiting the search techniques that police could employ and prohibiting the use of sophisticated searching software without prior court authorization. Given that narrowing the search could still accomplish recovery of the incriminating evidence which there was probable cause to believe would be found within the digital equipment seized, the court was within its discretion to reduce preliminarily the scope of the warrant, and the judicial officer did not abuse his power by restricting law enforcement's search to those items that met certain parameters based on dates, types of files, or the author of a document.

     Condition upon a search warrant stating that the State could not rely upon the plain view doctrine was unnecessary for privacy protection because other conditions, requiring the segregation of the search from the investigation and limiting the results of the search that can be shared, obviated application of the plain view doctrine.

     Exit request is constitutionally permissible when it is supported by objective facts that support a reasonable suspicion that the safety of investigating officers or members of the public is at risk or that a crime has been committed; several states have held that the smell of burning marijuana gives investigating officers at least such a reasonable suspicion.

     Search warrant was not invalidated by officer's failure to include, in application for warrant, information concerning unsuccessful initial search conducted near defendant's residence pursuant to an informant's tip; informant's factual assertions were substantiated by officer upon returning to area with informant, and officer's subsequent first-hand knowledge of marijuana growing in defendant's yard was sufficient by itself to establish probable cause to issue warrant.

     To determine whether affidavit establishes that objects probably connected with criminal activity can currently be found at a particularly described place, a court should look not only at the number of days between the facts relied upon in the affidavit and the time the warrant is issued, but also at the character of the crime and the thing to be seized.

     Although preferable, it is not always essential that the affidavit for a search warrant include first-hand evidence that the items sought are on the premises to be searched, since the nexus between the materials to be seized and the premises where the officers propose to search can be inferred from the nature of the crime, the type of materials sought, the extent of an opportunity for concealment, and reasonable inferences as to criminal behavior.

     Defendant's consent to being transported to the police barracks for a full-body strip search was not voluntary. First, defendant agreed to a search only after a trooper explicitly told him that both he and his companion would be "seized" and taken to the police barracks to await a warrant; second, the trooper lacked the authority to transport defendant to the barracks against his will because neither the informant's tip nor the trooper's lengthy surveillance or later interaction with defendant provided probable cause.

     As defendant's truck idling in the middle of the night in a parking lot of an auto repair shop that had previously been burglarized was not sufficient, without more, to give police reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity, the vehicle stop was constitutionally violative, requiring suppression.

     Defendants, who were passengers in a vehicle, had not shown that the driver's consent to search was not voluntary. The driver's observation of the officers' display of force might have been unsettling, but it was not specifically directed at him; the officer assured the driver several times in a level and conversational tone that he was not required to consent to a search of his car; the driver signed a consent-to-search form; and the fact that the officer told him that he would try to obtain a search warrant if the driver did not consent did not undermine his consent.

    </p>
    <p>
     Even if the driver of the vehicle in which defendants were passengers was effectively in custody and under arrest when he actually consented to the search of the vehicle, an officer's clear viewing of what appeared - based on his training and experience - to be cocaine on the floor of the car, combined with his earlier observation of what he believed to be marijuana flakes, the packaging of a white substance that he recognized as consistent with powdered cocaine, and the roll of cellophane wrap that was commonly used in packaging illegal drugs, was sufficient to establish probable cause to arrest. Thus, his consent was not irremediably tainted by an illegal de facto arrest. State v. Weisler, 190 Vt. 344, 35 A.3d 970 (2011).

     Off-duty officer was acting initially as a concerned homeowner and family member when he observed defendant's vehicle enter his driveway late at night; therefore, his initial encounter with defendant fell outside the Fourth Amendment.

     There was no basis to disturb the trial court's finding that defendant's consent to the search of her house was voluntary. There was no evidence that the police coerced her consent to search through the use of physical force, threats, or intimidation; defendant's concern that withholding consent might inconvenience her son did not amount to the sort of psychological pressure that courts view as impermissibly coercive; and an officer did not communicate that a warrant would automatically issue regardless of defendant's decision or that her refusal would be a futile gesture, but indicated truthfully and accurately that a refusal would result in an application for a search warrant involving the submission of an affidavit.

     Numerous courts have upheld consensual searches where an officer's statement that he would get or obtain a warrant is supported by probable cause.

     There were no grounds to require a pre-entry warning when the officers' stated intentions in asking to come inside defendant's house and talk to her were to confirm her brother's identity and continue their investigation into drug dealing. Defendant did not claim, nor did the record show, that the police sought entry for the purpose of conducting a warrantless search; indeed, the undisputed evidence revealed that the search request occurred only after the officers entered and observed marijuana in plain view.

     Totality of the evidence supported the conclusion that defendant's consent to the search of his car was voluntary. The trooper expressly told defendant that he did not have to agree to the search, that his permission had to be freely given, and that he could not be forced to consent; adding that the warrant process would result in his car being towed and in some delay was neither inaccurate nor disingenuous.

     Consensual encounters may be initiated by police without any objective level of suspicion and do not, without more, amount to seizures implicating Fourth Amendment protections. United States v. Tehrani, 826 F. Supp. 789 (D. Vt. 1993), aff'd, 49 F.3d 54 (2d Cir. 1996).

     Probation condition allowing warrantless searches was too broad and had to be narrowed to meet constitutional requirements, since condition was not based on findings that set proper balance between defendant's privacy rights and State's special needs and was not narrowly tailored to reflect that balance.

    <p>
     Defendant's challenge to probation condition that she consent in writing to enforcement of probation conditions through "search and investigation without warrant when necessary" was appropriate on direct appeal of her sentence, since mere presence of condition invaded defendant's privacy to such extent that she might change her activities, she might have been unable to challenge condition by alternative means, condition was imposed so that defendant would consent to waiver of Fourth Amendment rights in return for chance to avoid incarceration, and issue was recurring policy question.

     Distinctive characteristics of the dollar bill pouch dropped by defendant, combined with the officer's testimony that, based on his training and experience, such a container was commonly used to carry drugs, provided the officer with probable cause to believe a crime was afoot and to seize the pouch. Furthermore, the seizure of the pouch met the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement because if the officer had attempted to secure a warrant, there was a substantial likelihood that the evidence would have disappeared.

     Fundamental principles of Vermont's search and seizure jurisprudence seek to balance the legitimate goals of law enforcement with the right of citizens to be protected from government intrusion. Where incriminating evidence is literally dropped in front of a police officer who is lawfully carrying out his duties and where the incriminating nature of the evidence is immediately apparent, there is no intrusion into a constitutionally protected area that would preclude seizure of that evidence under the Vermont Constitution or the Fourth Amendment. State v. Delaoz, 189 Vt. 385, 22 A.3d 388 (2010).
    </p>
    <p>
     Where, after smelling alcohol and marijuana on the defendant's person and conducting field sobriety tests, a police officer determined that defendant had been driving while under the influence, and where the officer returned to the vehicle to retrieve an open alcohol container as evidence and noticed a partially exposed clear-plastic baggie containing marijuana, the seizure of the marijuana was valid under the "plain view" exception to the warrant requirement. State v. Trudeau, 165 Vt. 355, 683 A.2d 725 (1996).
    </p>
    <p>
     Because the vehicle belonging to defendant, who was charged with driving under the influence and the possession of marijuana, was located in a public parking lot, the arresting officer was lawfully present when he shined his flashlight into the car and observed the open container of alcohol, thus satisfying the first prong of the plain-view exception to warrant requirement, which requires that the officer does not violate the Fourth Amendment in arriving at the place from which the evidence can be plainly viewed. State v. Trudeau, 165 Vt. 355, 683 A.2d 725 (1996).
    </p>
    <p>
     Because an open container of alcohol was present in the vehicle of defendant, who was charged with driving under the influence (DUI) and possession of marijuana, the arresting officer had probable cause to associate with the crime of DUI a partially full beer can in a vehicle driven by a person who had failed a field sobriety test; therefore, the second prong of the plain-view exception to the warrant requirement, requiring probable cause to associate the evidence that is in plain view with criminal activity, was satisfied. State v. Trudeau, 165 Vt. 355, 683 A.2d 725 (1996).
    </p>
    <p>
     Because the vehicle of defendant, who was charged with driving under the influence and possession of marijuana, would have remained in the public parking lot where defendant was arrested and would have been accessible to the two other occupants of the vehicle who were not arrested, the State proved exigent circumstances existed, since the evidence, which was an open container of alcohol discovered by the arresting officer, could have been removed before a warrant was obtained; therefore, the third prong of the plain-view exception to the warrant requirement, which requires exigent circumstances to give an officer lawful access to the evidence, was satisfied. State v. Trudeau, 165 Vt. 355, 683 A.2d 725 (1996).
    </p>
    <p>
     After discovery by customs officials of marijuana in defendant's luggage, the retention of defendant's suitcases for five days for further investigation by customs officials and the Vermont State Police was not a violation of the Fourth Amendment because as contraband, an instrumentality of a crime, and evidence of a crime under the plain-view doctrine, defendant's luggage could be seized and held pending prosecution.

    </p>
    <p>
     Under plain view doctrine, constitutional protections do not attach to activities or possessions that a person knowingly exposes to the public; therefore, while an area may be within curtilage, there still may be no constitutional protection if activity in that area is knowingly exposed to the public.

     Police officers' warrantless seizure of rifle from car of defendant arrested for driving under the influence did not violate this amendment, where rifle was exposed to plain view of officers standing outside car, and where unattended rifle posed unacceptable danger to public at large and presented exceptional circumstance allowing officers to make a reasonable seizure without prior approval of judiciary.

     Seizure of weapon fell within plain view doctrine where officers were initially on premises pursuant to valid written consent; when they remained on premises and continued to search after defendant's oral consent, later determined to be invalid, officers had good faith belief consent was obtained, and such belief was objectively reasonable.

     Two of the essential elements for a plain view seizure are that the discovery must be inadvertent, and that the incriminating nature of the articles seized must be immediately apparent. State v.

    <p>
     Where officers were searching for certain business records pursuant to a valid search warrant and the search was limited to only those boxes in which the requested documents were stored, seizure of unrequested incriminating records, inadvertently discovered while sorting the records, was permitted under the plain view exception to the warrant requirement. State v. Dorn, 145 Vt. 606, 496 A.2d 451 (1985), modified on other grounds, Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128, 110 S. Ct. 2301, 110 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1990).

     Probable cause exists where the facts and circumstances within the arresting officer's knowledge are sufficient in themselves to warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that a crime is being committed.

     Merely suspicious surrounding circumstances of defendant's departure from a drug house and ingestion of something before stopping, followed by furtive and anxious behavior, without more, did not provide the probable cause necessary for arrest; consequently, there was no justification for a search incident to arrest, and the officer's initial pat-down, as well as his subsequent search of defendant for drugs, violated the Federal and State Constitutions.

    <p>
     Where police went to defendant's home upon receiving a complaint of a loud party and observed through a window that defendant was alone and appeared to be extremely intoxicated, the officers could reasonably believe that defendant was in need of immediate, emergency medical attention; however, reversal of the decision of the district court denying defendant's motion to suppress evidence and remand for factual development and findings was required because there was no explicit finding that the officers' decision to enter the dwelling was motivated primarily by the desire to assist defendant and inadequate evidence and findings existed as to whether the officers had a reasonable basis to associate the emergency with the place to be searched.

    <p>
     Court could not affirm the trial court's conclusion that a trooper's suspicion of driving under the influence became unreasonable for the sole reason that defendant passed two field sobriety tests; rather, the trooper was still faced with a situation in which defendant smelled of alcohol, had watery and bloodshot eyes, and admitted to drinking alcohol. The trooper testified that his training and experience suggested that the first two factors indicated possible impairment, and the third required no such training or experience to militate in favor of further investigation. State v. Mara, 186 Vt. 389, 987 A.2d 939 (2009).
    </p>
    <p>
     Trooper's decision to administer a preliminary breath test (PBT) to defendant rather than allow him to continue driving when defendant smelled of alcohol, admitted to drinking, and had bloodshot eyes was premised on a reasonable suspicion of driving under the influence (DUI), imposed a minimal intrusion on defendant's liberty, and was aimed at preventing serious danger to the public; it did not violate either the Vermont or the United States Constitution. The results of the PBT, in turn, provided probable cause to arrest defendant for DUI. State v. Mara, 186 Vt. 389, 987 A.2d 939 (2009).
    </p>
    <p>
     Although defendant's performance on walk-and-turn and one-leg-stand tests might not, by itself, have supported a reasonable suspicion of driving under the influence, it also did not as a matter of law compel a trooper to cease his roadside investigation. Although defendant did not "fail" the tests, his performance was not flawless, and the officer did not have to evaluate the test results in a binary fashion. State v. Mara, 186 Vt. 389, 987 A.2d 939 (2009).

     Seizure occurred when officer pulled his cruiser into breakdown lane behind defendant's vehicle, activated cruiser's blue lights and spotlight, and requested defendant's license and registration, since a reasonable person in defendant's position would objectively believe he was not free to leave following this show of authority. State v. Theetge, 171 Vt. 167, 759 A.2d 496 (2000).
    </p>
    <p>
     Officer had a reasonable and articulable suspicion that defendant was violating a motor vehicle law, since interstate highway where defendant's vehicle was parked was a limited access highway and defendant was not in a designated area where parking, standing, or stopping was allowed; trial court's order suppressing evidence obtained from seizure was therefore reversed. State v. Theetge, 171 Vt. 167, 759 A.2d 496 (2000).

     There was sufficient probable cause to believe that evidence of crime would be found within defendant's home; fact that marijuana plant in defendant's back yard appeared cultivated, as opposed to untended, supported inference that materials for manufacture and cultivation of marijuana existed at the residence, and informant had also provided information about drug paraphernalia located inside defendant's house.

     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     When the State conceded that a police officer lacked a reasonable, articulable suspicion of drug activity, the fact that defendant was only briefly delayed following a valid traffic stop was immaterial. The officer's authority under the Fourth Amendment to detain defendant ended when he informed defendant that he would be mailing a ticket for driving with a suspended license and so addressed the traffic violation that warranted the stop. State v. Alcide, 201 Vt. 103, 136 A.3d 207 (2016).
    </p>
    <p>
     Officer had reasonable suspicion under the Fourth Amendment and the Vermont Constitution to expand the scope of his suspended-license investigation into a drug investigation, permitting him to ask defendant to exit his vehicle and to interview defendant about a prescription bottle. Defendant was sitting in his car in an area of a parking lot known for drug activity; defendant made furtive movements as if shuffling an object in the front seat of the car when he saw the officer approaching; the object defendant appeared to hide from the officer was a prescription pill bottle with a worn label; defendant was nervous and shaking when asked for his identification; and defendant's wallet contained a large amount of crumpled bills. State v. Manning, 200 Vt. 423, 132 A.3d 716 (2015).
    </p>
    <p>
     When an officer approached and woke defendant, talked with him and informed him that he was free to go to sleep, and then returned with a second trooper, woke defendant again, and asked him pointed questions about criminal activity, the officer's field inquiry was converted into a Terry stop under the Fourth Amendment and the Vermont Constitution at the outset of the second encounter when the officer asked pointed questions of defendant. State v. Winters, 200 Vt. 296, 131 A.3d 186 (Sept. 4, 2015).
    </p>
    <p>
     Officer did not have reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, as he had not gleaned any information on his previous approach of defendant to indicate that defendant had any contraband, defendant's stale arrest record nearly a decade earlier did not provide the officer with reasonable suspicion, and defendant's comments that he had been coming from Massachusetts hardly supported a suspicion of drug possession. State v. Winters, 200 Vt. 296, 131 A.3d 186 (Sept. 4, 2015).
    </p>
    <p>
     Up until the time an off-duty police officer who caught petitioner peeping through his daughter's bedroom window announced he was a police officer and asked petitioner for identification, the officer was acting as a private citizen rather than a government actor subject to the restrictions of the Fourth Amendment. At that point, when petitioner sought to explain his behavior of peering into windows by giving the officer a story that did not comport with the actions the officer had observed, the officer was justified in further detaining petitioner to await the arrival of the police based on a reasonable suspicion that he had been engaged in criminal activity. In re Hoch, 194 Vt. 575, 82 A.3d 1167 (2013).
    </p>
    <p>
     Officers who stopped defendant were operating solely on a hunch; there was no reasonable and objective basis to suspect that he was then in possession of illegal drugs or engaged in any other criminal activity sufficient to justify an investigative detention. The detention was plainly invalid, therefore, and it was equally plain that the illegal detention irremediably tainted the consensual search of defendant's person that immediately followed. State v. Pitts, 186 Vt. 71, 978 A.2d 14 (2009).
    </p>
    <p>
     Even though a police officer did not personally observe any incriminating behavior by the driver, he could reasonably detain a vehicle where he was acting upon an anonymous tip that accurately described the vehicle, accurately predicted its route and location upon the highway, and indicated that it was behaving in a fashion indicative of drunk driving. State v. Boyea, 171 Vt. 401, 765 A.2d 862 (2000).
    </p>
    <p>
     Police officers may make an investigatory stop of a vehicle based upon reasonable suspicion that suspect is engaged in criminal activity; reasonable suspicion need not be based upon officer's personal observations, and an informant's tip, if it carries enough indicia of reliability, may justify a forcible stop. State v. Lamb, 168 Vt. 194, 720 A.2d 1101 (1998).
    </p>
    <p>
     Circumstances justified investigatory stop of defendant's vehicle, and trial court did not err in denying motion to suppress evidence obtained as a result of stop, where unnamed informant's tip that defendant was driving while intoxicated was corroborating information that could only have come from a knowledgeable insider, investigating officer had personal knowledge of defendant's prior DUI arrest, and potential danger posed by an intoxicated driver presented an imminent risk of injury to the suspect and the public. State v. Lamb, 168 Vt. 194, 720 A.2d 1101 (1998).

     Investigative detentions are limited stops for investigative purposes that can only be justified by a reasonable articulable suspicion supported by articulable facts that criminal activity may be afoot. United States v. Tehrani, 826 F. Supp. 789 (D. Vt. 1993), aff'd, 49 F.3d 54 (2d Cir. 1996).
    </p>
    <p>
     Police officer was justified in stopping defendant's car after being told by another motorist "there's something wrong with that man," although officer had no reasonable and articulable suspicion that defendant was committing crime because she did not see him engage in any unusual behavior or violate any motor vehicle law; investigatory stop of defendant's vehicle was a reasonable police response under the circumstances, because police have an essential role as public servants to assist those in distress and to maintain and foster public safety. State v. Marcello, 157 Vt. 657, 599 A.2d 357 (mem.) (1991).
    </p>
    <p>
     Investigative stop of defendant's vehicle was proper where officers received anonymous tip that occupants of vehicle were drunk and officers recognized driver as someone they believed to be under a license suspension; under the totality of the circumstances, officers had reasonable suspicion defendant was breaking the law.

    </p>
    <p>
     Deputy who observed defendant violate two motor vehicle statutes and then drive into driveway of private residence acted within his authority to conduct investigative stop by approaching the house, knocking on the door, and asking to speak to the driver of the vehicle. State v. Elkins, 155 Vt. 9, 580 A.2d 1200 (1990).
    </p>
    <p>
     Investigatory stops are permitted where specific and articulable facts, together with the rational inferences taken therefrom, reasonably warrant the intrusion, and the requisite level of suspicion is considerably less than proof of wrongdoing by a preponderance of the evidence. State v. Siergiey, 155 Vt. 78, 582 A.2d 119 (1990).
    </p>
    <p>
     For purposes of reasonable suspicion adequate to justify an investigatory stop, generally information about criminal or suspicious activity from a citizen who is not a paid informant and is unconnected with the police is presumed to be reliable.

     Officer's investigatory stop of driver based on citizen's complaint of erratic driving and officer's observation of extremely slow driving by defendant was sufficiently based on reasonable suspicion to warrant stop. State v. Siergiey, 155 Vt. 78, 582 A.2d 119 (1990).

     Where police officer heard defendant's vehicle drive over a curb and onto and along a sidewalk, detected an odor of alcohol on defendant's breath, observed defendant dispose of a beer bottle in the back of his truck, and saw empty beer cans in the back of the truck, it was reasonable for the officer to stop defendant to determine if probable cause existed to arrest him for driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.

     The reasonableness requirement of this amendment requires that an investigative detention be temporary and last no longer than is necessary to effectuate the purpose of the stop. State v. Hewey, 144 Vt. 10, 471 A.2d 236 (1983).

     In the case of defendant convicted of operating an automobile while his license was suspended, second offense, since the automobile that defendant was driving was stopped by a police officer because it bore Vermont registration plates but had a New Hampshire inspection sticker affixed to the windshield, after being stopped defendant was asked to produce both his license and registration, and after hearing defendant's explanation that he had bought the automobile in New Hampshire, transferred his Vermont plates to it and sent in to the Vermont Motor Vehicles Department for a registration certificate that he had not yet received, the officer continued the original detention for a few more minutes to verify that defendant had a valid license to operate the automobile, the intrusion upon defendant's privacy was minimal and did not constitute a violation of his rights under the amendment.

     The stopping of an automobile and the detention of its occupants constitutes a seizure within the meaning of this amendment, even though the purpose of the stop is limited and the resulting detention quite brief. State v. Phillips, 140 Vt. 210, 436 A.2d 746 (1981).

     While the police are permitted, on reasonable suspicion, to make an investigatory stop for a few minutes during which they may ask a brief question or two, any further detention must be based on consent or probable cause. State v. Phillips, 140 Vt. 210, 436 A.2d 746 (1981).

     The right to search an automobile and the validity of the seizure of items from it are not dependent on the right to arrest, rather they are dependent on the reasonable cause the seizing officer has for belief that the contents of the automobile offend against the law, and such reasonable cause depends upon the facts of the case.

    <p>
     Defendant who was stopped and charged with driving while intoxicated did not, by having driven through police roadblock, forfeit his right to challenge the legality of the roadblock; trial court improperly denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence obtained from the stop, and case would be remanded for adjudication of the legality of the roadblock. State v. Alexander, 157 Vt. 60, 595 A.2d 282 (1991).

     Roadblocks to screen intoxicated drivers constitute a seizure within the meaning of this amendment. State v. Martin, 145 Vt. 562, 496 A.2d 442 (1985).
    </p>
    <p>
     A warrantless seizure at a roadblock to screen intoxicated drivers is not per se illegal. State v. Martin, 145 Vt. 562, 496 A.2d 442 (1985).
    </p>
    <p>
     Roadblocks to screen intoxicated drivers serve the public interest as a safety measure, operating as one method of detecting intoxicated drivers, and further the public interest in reducing the number of intoxicated drivers by acting as a deterrent to any person who might consider driving after drinking. State v. Martin, 145 Vt. 562, 496 A.2d 442 (1985).
    </p>
    <p>
     Police officers conducting a roadblock to screen intoxicated drivers do not necessarily have to have a warrant, probable cause, or even a reasonable, articulable, individualized suspicion of illegal activity in order to stop a motorist on the public highway. State v. Martin, 145 Vt. 562, 496 A.2d 442 (1985).
    </p>
    <p>
     The constitutionality of a roadblock to screen intoxicated drivers will depend upon the reasonableness of the seizure, determined by weighing the public interest in the seizure against the degree of intrusion into personal privacy occasioned by the particular roadblock. State v. Martin, 145 Vt. 562, 496 A.2d 442 (1985).
    </p>
    <p>
     As a general rule, a roadblock to screen intoxicated drivers will pass constitutional muster if: (1) the initial stop and the contact between the officers in the field and the motorist involves an explanation of the nature of the roadblock and minimal detention of a nonimpaired driver; (2) the discretion of the officers in the field, as to the method to be utilized in selecting vehicles to be stopped, is carefully circumscribed by clear objective guidelines established by a high level administrative official; (3) the guidelines are followed in the operation of the roadblock; (4) approaching drivers are given adequate warning that there is a roadblock ahead; (5) the likelihood of apprehension, fear, or surprise is dispelled by a visible display of legitimate police authority at the roadblock; and (6) vehicles are stopped on a systematic, nonrandom basis that shows drivers they are not being singled out for arbitrary reasons. State v. Martin, 145 Vt. 562, 496 A.2d 442 (1985).
    </p>
    <p>
     Criteria set forth by Supreme Court to be used in a balancing test to determine the reasonableness of a particular roadblock to screen intoxicated drivers are not absolute requirements, and trial courts considering those criteria in relation to the totality of the circumstances may find some of the criteria are not applicable or that additional or different criteria are equally important. State v. Martin, 145 Vt. 562, 496 A.2d 442 (1985).
    </p>
    <p>
     When police establish a roadblock to screen intoxicated drivers, the operating guidelines do not have to be established by administrative, policy-making officers who are totally removed from field operations; neither the possibility of supplemental oral instructions, nor the possibility of changes in operating guidelines in response to field conditions, will necessarily invalidate established guidelines that would otherwise be acceptable. State v. Martin, 145 Vt. 562, 496 A.2d 442 (1985).
    </p>
    <p>
     Advance notice of the exact location is not an absolute necessity for roadblocks to screen intoxicated drivers, since publishing the exact spot of the checkpoint would lessen the deterrent effect. State v. Martin, 145 Vt. 562, 496 A.2d 442 (1985).
    </p>
    <p>
     Where trial court ruled that a roadblock to screen intoxicated drivers violated defendant's rights under this amendment, failure to make findings concerning the criteria suggested by the Supreme Court for determining the reasonableness of such roadblocks mandated reversal.

    <p>
     Defendant's arrest violated the Fourth Amendment and Vt. Const. Ch. I, Art. 11 because there was no probable cause to arrest him for negligent operation of a motor vehicle. His driving over a washed-out part of a driveway was not negligent, given that unpaved roads were commonplace in Vermont, and his speed of 25 mph did not change this conclusion since there was no evidence that his speed was excessive under the circumstances or unnecessary to traverse the washout as he did. State v. Hawkins, 193 Vt. 297, 67 A.3d 230 (2013).
    </p>
    <p>
     Several considerations supported the trial court's determination that an informant's information, which led to defendant's warrantless arrest, was reliable on this occasion: first, there was strong evidence that the informant was involved in selling drugs at the retail level in Rutland; second, the informant described defendant's vehicle, predicted the time and route of his arrival into Rutland, and personally identified him on three occasions; third, the identity of the confidential informant was known to the police, as well as to defendant and the trial court, and she gave a statement under oath describing her past involvement with defendant; fourth, the informant provided information that implicated her in commission of a crime. The fact that the informant made a self-serving declaration to try to prevent liability for an additional crime did not undercut the reliability assessment, nor did the informant's motive in assisting the police. State v. Arrington, 188 Vt. 460, 8 A.3d 483 (2010).

     Excessive force was not used in the seizure of the plaintiff when a police officer knocked his feet out from under him, grabbed him around the chest, and forced him to the ground since the officer had reason to be concerned that the suddenly uncooperative plaintiff might present a danger to the officers, himself, or others, especially as the complaint that prompted officers' arrival at the plaintiff's house involved a weapon, albeit a BB gun. Flanigan v. Town of Colchester, 171 F. Supp. 2d 361 (D. Vt. 2001).
    </p>
    <p>
     While the act of flight may be indicative of guilty knowledge, it does not provide a proper basis for an arrest unless coupled with specific knowledge relating the suspect to the evidence of the crime, because the mere act of fleeing is an ambiguous act. State v. Emilo, 144 Vt. 477, 479 A.2d 169 (1984).
    </p>
    <p>
     Where defendant convicted of operating a motor vehicle without the consent of the owner took flight after the vehicle had been stopped, but the officer who stopped the vehicle had no articulable and reasonable suspicion that the vehicle, or its occupants, were in any way connected or associated with any wrongdoing, the act of defendant in running away could not alone provide the officer with probable cause to arrest him. State v. Emilo, 144 Vt. 477, 479 A.2d 169 (1984).

    <p>
     This amendment does not require that the occurrence of a criminal act be proven beyond a reasonable doubt before a warrantless arrest can be valid; proof that the occurrence of a criminal act is probable is sufficient. State v. Phillips, 140 Vt. 210, 436 A.2d 746 (1981).

     Probable cause to arrest exists if the facts and circumstances known to the officer warrant a prudent man in believing that the offense has been committed. State v. Phillips, 140 Vt. 210, 436 A.2d 746 (1981).
    </p>
    <p>
     For probable cause to exist in a warrantless arrest situation, it is necessary that some facts substantiating the commission of an alleged crime be communicated to the arresting officer or to an officer with whom he is in communication. State v. Phillips, 140 Vt. 210, 436 A.2d 746 (1981).

    <p>
     The ultimate discovery of evidence sought to be excluded cannot be considered in evaluating whether probable cause existed at the time of the detention, because an arrest or search cannot be justified by what the search discloses. State v. Phillips, 140 Vt. 210, 436 A.2d 746 (1981).

     Evidence found outside a police cruiser after defendant was taken to the police barracks for a strip search, and his subsequent confession, should have been suppressed. Defendant's presence at the barracks resulted directly from his invalidly obtained consent to the search, and his confession to possessing drugs flowed directly from the discovery of the illegally obtained evidence.

    </p>
    <p>
     When officers' interest in the house of defendant's sister flowed from a taxi dispatcher's initial identification of the house as the address where a taxi was regularly sent from a suspected drug-dealing operation, they had ample information independent of the money and drugs illegally seized from defendant's person to investigate the residence. That evidence did not, therefore, taint the additional evidence seized from the house, and its suppression was not required. State v. Pitts, 186 Vt. 71, 978 A.2d 14 (2009).
    </p>
    <p>
     By excluding evidence wrongfully obtained in unlawful searches and seizures, the effect is a "tendency to promote institutional compliance with Fourth Amendment requirements on the part of law enforcement agencies generally," in addition to promoting compliance by individual officers who are "penalize[d]" under the rule for Fourth Amendment violations.

     Good faith exception to exclusionary rule was not applicable to make shotgun found in defendant's apartment available as evidence, where search warrant was unconstitutionally overbroad and was the type of facially invalid warrant that could not have been relied upon in good faith, because one who simply looked at the warrant would suspect it was invalid.

     Fact that fugitive warrant was improperly kept in government "active" files in violation of three-way plea agreement between New Hampshire, Vermont, and defendant did not require suppression of evidence seized during search incident to arrest based on the warrant.

     The concern of the exclusionary rule centers on the proposition that enforcement officers may not embark on groundless invasions of the person or premises and justify them by the fruits obtained; the requirement is that such incursions must be supported before the fact.

    <p>
     Where defendant was convicted of operating a motor vehicle without the consent of the owner, but the trial court found that at the time the vehicle was stopped the officer who arrested defendant did not have an articulable suspicion of wrongdoing regarding the vehicle or its occupants, the arresting officer's observation of defendant as the driver of the vehicle, made while leading defendant to the police cruiser after arresting him, came about by exploitation of the unlawful stop and, therefore, the officer's in-court identification of defendant was properly suppressible as the result of unlawful police conduct.

     In a case where a detective should have known that his request to defendant, who had invoked his right to silence, was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response, the court declined the State's invitation to apply the United States Supreme Court's decision in a Fourth Amendment case involving good-faith reliance on a police database. How this radically different factual scenario - and the disparate legal framework under which the Court analyzed it - might inform the present court's analysis in a Fifth Amendment case was murky at best.

     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     Although an officer's stop of defendant for having a pine-tree-shaped air freshener suspended from his rearview mirror was based on a misapprehension of the law-i.e., that the obstructing-windshields statute prohibited the hanging of any item on the inside of a windshield without regard to whether the item materially obstructed the driver's vision-the officer's misapprehension was an objectively reasonable one under the circumstances. Therefore, the Fourth Amendment did not require exclusion of the evidence gathered from the traffic stop, and the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress. State v. Hurley, 198 Vt. 552, 117 A.3d 433 (2015).
    </p>
    <p>
     There was no merit to defendant's argument that a visual estimate of speed was insufficient grounds to justify a traffic stop under the Fourth Amendment. Here, both officers had undergone specialized training in visual speed estimation for radar certification; furthermore, what was more compelling was the fact that in both instances the observed speed was significantly higher than the posted speed limit, such that the difference would be discernible to a casual observer, particularly a trained law enforcement officer. State v. Dunham, 193 Vt. 378, 67 A.3d 275 (2012).
    </p>
    <p>
     When defendant screeched his tires and revved his engine as he proceeded from a stop and turned the corner, and the road was dry and clear of snow and ice at the time, an officer could conclude that defendant's squealing of tires was intentional. It was thus reasonable for the officer to suspect that defendant did not have reasonable control of his vehicle, and the stop of defendant's vehicle therefore did not violate the Fourth Amendment and the Vermont Constitution. State v. Rutter, 189 Vt. 574, 15 A.3d 132 (2011).
    </p>
    <p>
     Plain meaning of the statute pertaining to signals showed that a driver had to indicate an intention to turn within 100 feet of turning regardless of traffic conditions. Thus, because defendant's conduct of not using her signal until just before she turned violated the statute, a trooper had reasonable suspicion under the Fourth Amendment and the Vermont Constitution to make a traffic stop. State v. Fletcher, 187 Vt. 632, 996 A.2d 213 (mem.) (2010).
    </p>
    <p>
     In a case where defendant was stopped because he failed to use a turn signal when exiting a rotary, the court could not agree that any exit from any rotary was necessarily a change of direction; it was possible that in some rotaries, the entry and exit locations would be located in such proximity to each other that a vehicle could travel through the rotary without making any discernible or significant change in direction. Given this kind of possibility, and because the turn-signal statute was silent on the subject of rotaries, and the only statutory provision addressing rotaries was silent on the subject of turn signals, it was necessary for the State to demonstrate that defendant's exit off this particular rotary constituted a change of direction in order to justify the traffic stop; thus, remand for an evidentiary hearing on defendant's motion to suppress was required. State v. Harris, 186 Vt. 225, 980 A.2d 785 (2009).

     Inference that if a bag found on another passenger in the car in which defendant juvenile was riding contained contraband, then a bag found on defendant was likely to contain contraband, was too broad to make the presence of contraband immediately apparent. There was no connection between the other passenger and defendant, other than that they were passengers in the same vehicle; there was no evidence of drug activity involving the vehicle, which was stopped for speeding, and no evidence that defendant attempted to flee, as the other passenger did, or otherwise engaged in any suspicious or incriminating behavior. In re C.C., 186 Vt. 474, 987 A.2d 1000 (2009).

      43. Blood alcohol tests.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     Admission of evidence of a refusal to submit to a blood test in the context of a driving-under-the-influence criminal proceeding does not violate the Fourth Amendment. State v. Rajda, 208 Vt. 324, 196 A.3d 1108 (2018).
    </p>
    <p>
     Because the Fourth Amendment did not bar admission in a criminal driving-under-the-influence proceeding of evidence of a refusal to submit to a warrantless blood draw, the trial court did not err in admitting the evidence of defendant's refusal to submit to a warrantless blood test and in instructing the jury that it could (but was not required to) draw an inference from that evidence. State v. Francis, 208 Vt. 560, 201 A.3d 386 (2018).
    </p>
    <p>
     At the point a preliminary breath test (PBT) was administered, an officer needed only to have some basis for believing that a suspect might be driving under the influence; thus, when an officer smelled alcohol and saw that defendant's eyes were bloodshot and watery, this was enough to provide him with reasonable suspicion that defendant had been driving under the influence (DUI) and justified administration of the PBT and the subsequent dexterity tests. The results of those tests (including a 0.106 blood alcohol content and failure of six measures of dexterity) combined with the other observed indicia of intoxication provided the officer with probable cause to arrest defendant for DUI. State v. Santimore, 186 Vt. 638, 987 A.2d 332 (mem.) (2009).
    </p>
    <p>
     As there were no other facts or circumstances in evidence that would add to an officer's belief that a plastic bag felt during a pat-down search of defendant juvenile contained illegal drugs, the incriminating character of the contraband located in defendant's pocket was not immediately apparent to the officer, and thus the officer did not have probable cause under the plain-feel doctrine to remove the contents of defendant's pocket without a warrant. Therefore, defendant's Fourth Amendment rights were violated, and the Ecstasy pill seized from defendant's pocket should have been suppressed. In re C.C., 186 Vt. 474, 987 A.2d 1000 (2009).

      44. Private searches.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     Online service provider was not acting as a government agent when it searched defendant's transmissions over its network using its hashing technology, as it monitored them based on its business interest, not because it was encouraged or directed to by government, and the government did not know about or participate in the action. State v. Lizotte, 208 Vt. 240, 197 A.3d 362 (2018).
    </p>
    <p>
     National Center for Missing and Exploited Children was acting as an agent of law enforcement when it opened defendant's e-mail and the related attachment sent to it by the online service provider, as the government knew that the center would be collecting reports of suspected child pornography, provided direction on how the information would be treated, and mandated that the information obtained be shared with the government, and the center was motivated at least in part by a desire to assist law enforcement. State v. Lizotte, 208 Vt. 240, 197 A.3d 362 (2018).
    </p>
    <p>
     When an online service provider sent a report about an image to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, NCMEC knew for certain that the image was one that had been previously viewed by the online service provider and one that contained apparent child pornography. Thus, when NCMEC and then law enforcement opened the attachment forwarded by the online service provider, they were not expanding its search because they already knew what was contained in the attachment and they could not learn more than was already known by the provider about the attachment. State v. Lizotte, 208 Vt. 240, 197 A.3d 362 (2018).
    </p>
    <p>
     When the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and the government viewed an e-mail forwarded by an online service provider, this expanded the private search conducted by the provider, which had no knowledge of the e-mail contents. There were, however, no grounds to invalidate the resulting warrant because even without the information from the content of the e-mail, the affidavit in support of the warrant established probable cause. State v. Lizotte, 208 Vt. 240, 197 A.3d 362 (2018).

     Despite the historical recognition of the privilege against self-incrimination and the language of Chapter I, Article 10, in its application to adults, the Article 10 privilege against self-incrimination and that contained in the Fifth Amendment are synonymous.

     The Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution may require the dismissal of an indictment if it is shown that a preindictment delay caused substantial prejudice to defendant's rights to a fair trial, and that the delay was an intentional device to gain tactical advantage over the accused. State v. Beer, 177 Vt. 245, 864 A.2d 643 (October 1, 2004).

      5. Double jeopardy.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     Defendant's convictions of sexual assault of a person under the age of 18 entrusted to his care by authority of law and of sexual exploitation of a minor violated the Double Jeopardy Clause, because as charged here, they required proof of the same set of facts and were directed at the same harm stemming from coercive sexual relationships. State v. Nelson, - Vt.
    - , 246 A.3d 937 (Oct. 16, 2020).
    </p>
    <p>
     Defendant's convictions of repeated aggravated sexual assault and sexual assault of a person under the age of 18 entrusted to his care by authority of law did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause, as each crime as charged required proof of at least one element that the other did not, and there was no clear legislative intent to preclude prosecution for both offenses as charged here. State v. Nelson, - Vt.
    - , 246 A.3d 937 (Oct. 16, 2020).
    </p>
    <p>
     Convicting defendant of two domestic assault charges did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause's prohibition against multiple punishments for the same offense, because while the alleged acts happened close in time and in the same place, they were interrupted by an interval when the complainant left the kitchen, took a highchair to a bedroom, and then placed a child in the highchair, during which time defendant called the children's school, giving him sufficient time to reflect on his conduct and recommit himself to abusing the victim. State v. Abel, 210 Vt. 1, 210 A.3d 439 (2019).
    </p>
    <p>
     Because it was unquestioned that jeopardy attached when the jury was empaneled and sworn in, and a mistrial over defendant's objection was an abuse of discretion that did not evince the manifest necessity without which the ends of public justice would otherwise be defeated, the Double Jeopardy Clause precluded retrial of defendant on the mistried charges. State v. Dow, 202 Vt. 616, 152 A.3d 437 (2016).
    </p>
    <p>
     Defendant's convictions for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and attempted simple assault by physical menace violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as the simple assault was a lesser included offense of the aggravated assault charge. State v. Dow, 202 Vt. 616, 152 A.3d 437 (2016).
    </p>
    <p>
     There was no merit to defendant's suggestion that the same prior felonies could not support a habitual-offender enhancement on more than one subsequent charge. The trial court's application of the habitual-offender enhancement did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause, and was thus not error of any kind, much less plain error. State v. Stanley, 200 Vt. 341, 131 A.3d 1114 (2015).
    </p>
    <p>
     Upon examination of the statutes for sexual assault and sexual assault of a vulnerable adult, it could not be concluded that the arguably irrational disparity in punishments between them with respect to sexual assault demonstrated a clear legislative intent to allow cumulative punishments under the circumstances of defendant's case, where he had engaged in one incident with the victim. State v. Breed, 198 Vt. 574, 117 A.3d 829 (2015).
    </p>
    <p>
     Charge of impeding a public officer required proof that defendant committed the unlawful act of giving false information to a police officer implicating his wife. In effect, the impeding charge incorporated the false information charge, making false information a predicate offense to defendant's conviction for impeding, and in such circumstances, a guilty verdict obtained on both the predicate and compounding offense violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. State v. Neisner, 189 Vt. 160, 16 A.3d 597 (2010).
    </p>
    <p>
     Although the trial court erred in allowing the jury to try defendant on multiplicitous counts, it subsequently dismissed one count so that defendant stood convicted on only one charge and received one sentence for it. Thus, the trial court's action addressed the primary "vice" of multiplicity, the receipt of multiple punishments for the same offense. State v. Hazelton, 186 Vt. 342, 987 A.2d 915 (Aug. 21, 2009).
    </p>
    <p>
     When defendant was sentenced on two counts of boating while intoxicated, and the second count was vacated on appeal because both counts arose out of the same incident, the aggregate sentence imposed on defendant on remand, though it required his reincarceration, was less than his original aggregate sentence, and so did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. State v. Martin, 185 Vt. 286, 973 A.2d 56 (2009).
    </p>
    <p>
     Convictions of defendant for attempted felony violation of a relief from abuse order by following or stalking the victim, and contempt for violating his condition of release by coming within 100 feet of the victim or her vehicle, did not violate double jeopardy. State v. Prior, 181 Vt. 564, 917 A.2d 466 (mem.) (January 5, 2007).
    </p>
    <p>
     The Double Jeopardy Clause prohibits second or subsequent prosecutions for the same offense as well as multiple impositions of punishment for an offense. The Double Jeopardy Clause does not, however, prevent cumulative punishments when the Legislature has proscribed conduct by more than one criminal statute or offense. State v. Wiley, 181 Vt. 300, 917 A.2d 501 (February 2, 2007).
    </p>
    <p>
     Defendant's convictions for attempted first-degree murder, aggravated assault, and kidnapping arising from the same event did not violate double jeopardy because each of the crimes requires proof of a fact that the others do not. State v. Stevens, 175 Vt. 503, 825 A.2d 8 (mem.) (2003).
    </p>
    <p>
     Defendant's convictions for aggravated domestic assault and aggravated assault did not violate double jeopardy, since he was not punished twice for the "same offense," but in fact received two sentences for two different crimes. State v. Karov, 170 Vt. 650, 756 A.2d 1236 (mem.) (2000).
    </p>
    <p>
     Guarantees against double jeopardy found in Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments bar subsequent prosecution for a lesser offense if, in proving the greater offense, prosecution relies on and proves elements of the lesser offense as an element of the greater offense. State v. Crawford, 169 Vt. 371, 737 A.2d 366 (1999).
    </p>
    <p>
     Dismissal "with prejudice" pursuant to Interstate Agreement on Detainers barred defendant's prosecution on dismissed sexual assault and burglary charges, but did not prohibit his subsequent prosecution for trespass arising out of the same alleged criminal transaction, since newly charged crime was not a lesser included offense of dismissed charge, and collateral estoppel protection embodied in the Fifth Amendment did not apply. State v. Crawford, 169 Vt. 371, 737 A.2d 366 (1999).
    </p>
    <p>
     Defendant's right not to be placed in second jeopardy is personal and can be waived voluntarily. State v. Maunsell, 170 Vt. 543, 743 A.2d 580 (mem.) (1999).
    </p>
    <p>
     Where defendant was convicted of both aggravated murder and aggravated sexual assault, his sentence for aggravated sexual assault was impermissible under the Double Jeopardy Clause; serious bodily injury is always proved by proof of death and therefore aggravated sexual assault was a lesser-included offense of aggravated murder, since the lesser offense required no proof beyond that required of the greater offense. State v. Grega, 168 Vt. 363, 721 A.2d 445 (1998).
    </p>
    <p>
     Multiple convictions cannot stand to provide a backup conviction in event that conviction on greater offense is reversed, and therefore murder defendant's conviction for aggravated sexual assault was vacated. State v. Grega, 168 Vt. 363, 721 A.2d 445 (1998).
    </p>
    <p>
     The court's decision, in a prosecution for first-degree murder, to submit a reduced charge of second-degree murder to the jury was within its authority and did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause. A defendant charged with first-degree murder may be convicted of the lesser-included offenses of second-degree murder or manslaughter. A court may thus submit to the jury the lesser offense if it determines that the evidence is insufficient to establish an element of the greater offense. State v. Hatcher, 167 Vt. 338, 706 A.2d 429 (1997).
    </p>
    <p>
     Trial court's decision that a single act of domestic assault, committed under two separate aggravating circumstances, could be punished as separate offenses violated defendant's right against double jeopardy. State v. Ritter, 167 Vt. 632, 714 A.2d 624 (mem.) (1998).
    </p>
    <p>
     Prosecution of defendant for manufacture of marijuana did not constitute double jeopardy on account of prior civil in rem forfeiture of his property pursuant to federal statute. United States v. Brophil,, 96 F.3d 31 (2d Cir. 1996).
    </p>
    <p>
     A two-step analysis is required to determine whether the government has subjected a defendant to multiple punishment by instituting both a criminal prosecution and a civil forfeiture proceeding: (1) whether the civil forfeiture action and the claimant's criminal prosecution constituted separate proceedings; and (2) whether the civil forfeiture constituted a punishment. United States v. Brophil, 899 F. Supp. 1257 (D. Vt. 1995), rev'd on other grounds, 96 F.3d 31 (2d Cir. 1996).
    </p>
    <p>
     Rather than follow the per se rule that jeopardy never attaches when a defendant fails to appear at a civil forfeiture proceeding, the court, in multiple punishment cases, will analyze each case individually in order to determine whether the government has used separate proceedings against a defendant to impose multiple punishments for the same offense. United States v. Brophil, 899 F. Supp. 1257 (D. Vt. 1995), rev'd on other grounds, 96 F.3d 31 (2d Cir. 1996).
    </p>
    <p>
     Double Jeopardy Clause has two components: prosecution component protects against subsequent prosecution for same offense after either an acquittal or conviction, and punishment component protects against multiple punishments for the same offense. United States v. McCormick, 798 F. Supp. 203 (D. Vt. 1992), aff'd, 992 F.2d 437 (2d Cir. 1993), overruled in part, United States v. Birbal, 62 F.3d 456 (2d Cir. 1995), and overruled in part, United States v. Gallego, 907 F. Supp. 735 (S.D.N.Y. 1995).
    </p>
    <p>
     Double Jeopardy Clause protects against both subsequent prosecution for same offense after acquittal or conviction, and multiple punishments for same offense. United States v. McCormick, 992 F.2d 437 (2d Cir. 1993), overruled in part, United States v. Birbal, 62 F.3d 456 (2d Cir. 1995), and overruled in part, United States v. Gallego, 907 F. Supp. 735 (S.D.N.Y. 1995).
    </p>
    <p>
     Multiple punishments prong of Double Jeopardy Clause limits prosecutorial and judicial action but does not prevent Legislature from assigning multiple punishments for same conduct. United States v. McCormick, 992 F.2d 437 (2d Cir. 1993), overruled in part, United States v. Birbal, 62 F.3d 456 (2d Cir. 1995), and overruled in part, United States v. Gallego, 907 F. Supp. 735 (S.D.N.Y. 1995).
    </p>
    <p>
     Absent evidence to the contrary, it is assumed that Congress ordinarily does not intend to punish the same offense under two different statutes. United States v. McCormick, 992 F.2d 437 (2d Cir. 1993), overruled in part, United States v. Birbal, 62 F.3d 456 (2d Cir. 1995), and overruled in part, United States v. Gallego, 907 F. Supp. 735 (S.D.N.Y. 1995).
    </p>
    <p>
     A defendant's right to be free from double jeopardy is not infringed by sentencing enhancements based upon acquitted, much less dismissed, counts of an indictment. United States v. Streich, 987 F.2d 104 (2d Cir. 1993).
    </p>
    <p>
     Defendant was not subjected to double jeopardy when court granted his motion for judgment of acquittal on two counts and then reversed its ruling during trial, where both initial decision and its recall were outside hearing of jury. United States v. Washington, 836 F. Supp. 192 (D. Vt. 1993), cert. denied, 515 U.S. 1151, 115 S. Ct. 2596, 132 L. Ed. 2d 843 (1995).

     Insofar as 33 V.S.A.
     §
     5527(c) permits the transfer of a juvenile matter from family court to district court and trial of a juvenile defendant as an adult, following an adjudication of delinquency in the family court, that statute violates the double jeopardy protections of the Fifth Amendment of the United States Constitution. In re J.G, 161 Vt. 563, 632 A.2d 39 (mem.) (1993).
    </p>
    <p>
     The Double Jeopardy Clause protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal, against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction, and against multiple punishments for the same offense. State v. Strong, 158 Vt. 56, 605 A.2d 510 (1992).
    </p>
    <p>
     Under the Double Jeopardy Clause a defendant who already has been punished in a criminal prosecution may not be subjected to an additional civil sanction to the extent that the second sanction may not fairly be characterized as remedial, but only as a deterrent or retribution. State v. Strong, 158 Vt. 56, 605 A.2d 510 (1992).
    </p>
    <p>
     Fact that a statute designed primarily to serve remedial purposes incidentally serves the purpose of punishment as well does not mean that the statute results in punishment for double jeopardy purposes. State v. Strong, 158 Vt. 56, 605 A.2d 510 (1992).
    </p>
    <p>
     For purposes of double jeopardy protections, civil license suspension was not a "punishment," where governing statute's plain language indicated suspension was of civil nature, statutory scheme was not so punitive as to negate Legislature's intent to make it civil in nature, suspension was actually the revocation of a privilege voluntarily granted, license suspensions had historically served a regulatory purpose, element of deterrence present in suspension was common in all losses of licenses or privileges and was not primary focus of statutory scheme, and suspension served rational remedial purpose of protecting public safety. State v. Strong, 158 Vt. 56, 605 A.2d 510 (1992).
    </p>
    <p>
     A civil driver's license suspension is not a criminal prosecution for purposes of double jeopardy, since Legislature intended a civil proceeding, civil procedure rules apply, evidentiary standard of proof is civil, and no criminal sanction may be imposed through the proceeding. State v. Strong, 158 Vt. 56, 605 A.2d 510 (1992).
    </p>
    <p>
     Defendant charged in Vermont with bank fraud and related crimes was entitled to dismissal, on double jeopardy grounds, of Vermont counts considered during sentencing in earlier prosecution in district of Connecticut; defendant was already punished for Vermont conduct where sentencing judge in Connecticut increased defendant's base offense level and corresponding range of penalties based on consideration of Vermont conduct, there was no clear evidence Congress intended an individual committing bank fraud in two states to receive punishment both from an increase in the base offense level in one proceeding and from a conviction and sentence based on the same fraud in a second proceeding, and even a totally concurrent sentence in the district of Vermont would violate punishment component of Double Jeopardy Clause. United States v. McCormick, 798 F. Supp. 203 (D. Vt. 1992), aff'd, 992 F.2d 437 (2d Cir. 1993), overruled in part, United States v. Birbal, 62 F.3d 456 (2d Cir. 1995), and overruled in part, United States v. Gallego, 907 F. Supp. 735 (S.D.N.Y. 1995).
    </p>
    <p>
     Where defendant claimed that his DUI prosecution following his license suspension violated Double Jeopardy Clause by constituting multiple punishment after multiple prosecution for the same conduct, fact that his civil proceeding addressing the same conduct came first was not determinative, since exaction of a civil sanction had the same double jeopardy effect whether before or after imposition of criminal punishment. State v. Strong, 158 Vt. 56, 605 A.2d 510 (1992).
    </p>
    <p>
     Double jeopardy does not prevent a judge from imposing a harsher sentence on a defendant than originally intended after acceptance of his plea. State v. Duval, 156 Vt. 122, 589 A.2d 321 (1991).
    </p>
    <p>
     At trial for driving under the influence where trial court's decision not to appoint counsel for defendant was based on incomplete information and on resulting sentencing prediction that defendant would not be incarcerated or fined in excess of $1,000, jeopardy did not attach upon the court's acceptance of defendant's guilty plea, and therefore the court was not precluded from imposing harsher sentence after giving defendant opportunity to withdraw his plea. State v. Duval, 156 Vt. 122, 589 A.2d 321 (1991).
    </p>
    <p>
     Where parents were charged with violating, on only two days, truancy statute that proscribed failure to send the child to school "for the full number of days for which a school is held," double jeopardy claim was premature, but could be raised if parents were again prosecuted for failure to send their child to school in the same school year. State v. DeLaBruere, 154 Vt. 237, 577 A.2d 254 (1990).
    </p>
    <p>
     The Double Jeopardy Clause required reversal of a trial court's declaration of mistrial based on sheriff 's misconduct in murder case; manifest necessity for mistrial did not exist where it was declared after the jury reached its verdict of not guilty but before the jury had been dismissed; trial judge should have reconsidered his decision in light of fact that sheriff 's misconduct had not deprived defendant of a fair trial or favorable verdict. Corey v. District Court of Vermont, Unit #1, 917 F.2d 88 (2d Cir. 1990).
    </p>
    <p>
     Once jeopardy attaches, defendant has a valued right to have his trial completed by a particular tribunal, but this right is not absolute, and must be balanced against public interest in ensuring that prosecutor receives one full opportunity to present his case against accused. State v. Corey, 151 Vt. 325, 561 A.2d 87 (1989).
    </p>
    <p>
     Defendant's right against double jeopardy was not violated when trial court, without dismissing charges, declared a mistrial based on sheriff 's pacing off the distance from which defendant allegedly shot victim, during jury's deliberations in response to a question without notice to the court. State v. Corey, 151 Vt. 325, 561 A.2d 87 (1989).
    </p>
    <p>
     Double Jeopardy Clause was not violated at hearing on motion for judgment of acquittal at close of State's case-in-chief, by allowing the State to recall victim to make positive identification of defendant as her assailant. State v. Sorrell, 152 Vt. 543, 568 A.2d 376 (1989).
    </p>
    <p>
     During a trial by jury, jeopardy attaches with the empanelling and swearing in of the jury. State v. Corey, 151 Vt. 325, 561 A.2d 87 (1989).
    </p>
    <p>
     Defendant's double jeopardy protection was not violated by prosecution of charges after those charges had been taken into consideration in sentencing defendant on a prior, unrelated conviction. State v. Doucette, 150 Vt. 125, 549 A.2d 268 (1988).
    </p>
    <p>
     The Double Jeopardy Clause of this amendment protects against a second prosecution for the same offense after acquittal. State v. Ramsay, 146 Vt. 70, 499 A.2d 15 (1985).
    </p>
    <p>
     Where prosecutorial conduct which led to a mistrial was merely negligent, was not intended to provoke the defendant into moving for a mistrial, and did not render unmeaningful defendant's choice to continue or to abort the proceeding, retrial was not barred by the Double Jeopardy Clause of this amendment. State v. Wood, 146 Vt. 57, 498 A.2d 494 (1985).
    </p>
    <p>
     The guarantee of this amendment against double jeopardy protects against a separate prosecution for the same offense after acquittal, against a second prosecution for the same offense after conviction, and against multiple punishments for the same offense. State v. Rice, 145 Vt. 25, 483 A.2d 248 (1984).
    </p>
    <p>
     The Double Jeopardy Clause of this amendment does not provide a defendant with the right to know at any specific moment in time what the exact limit of his punishment will turn out to be. State v. Rice, 145 Vt. 25, 483 A.2d 248 (1984).
    </p>
    <p>
     The Double Jeopardy Clause of this amendment does not require that a sentence be given a degree of finality that prevents its later increase. State v. Boyer, 144 Vt. 393, 481 A.2d 15 (1984).
    </p>
    <p>
     The mere possibility that the prosecution may seek to rely on all the elements of a lesser offense to establish a greater offense that has been charged is not sufficient to bar prosecution for the greater offense under the Double Jeopardy Clause of this amendment. State v. Bourn, 139 Vt. 14, 421 A.2d 1281 (1980).
    </p>
    <p>
     Vermont law relating to former jeopardy has, through the operation of the Fourteenth Amendment, become the law of the Double Jeopardy Clause of this amendment. In re Dunkerley, 135 Vt. 260, 376 A.2d 43 (1977).
    </p>
    <p>

     Jeopardy attaches with the empanelling and swearing in of the jury, or, in a trial by court, when the court begins to receive evidence. In re Dunkerley, 135 Vt. 260, 376 A.2d 43 (1977).

     It is a violation of the guarantee against double jeopardy of this amendment to fail, upon resentencing, to give credit for punishment already endured. Stewart v. Smith, 129 Vt. 182, 274 A.2d 504 (1971).
    </p>
    <p>
     In resentencing, this amendment does not bar an increase in a sentence, but it must be based on objective information concerning identifiable conduct on the part of the defendant occurring after the time of the original sentencing, and not on retaliatory or vindictive motivations. Stewart v. Smith, 129 Vt. 182, 274 A.2d 504 (1971).
    </p>
    <p>
     Disciplinary action imposed upon inmates for a breach of confinement in the course of the administration of a correctional institution constitutes no double jeopardy barrier to a criminal prosecution for escape. Stewart v. Smith, 129 Vt. 182, 274 A.2d 504 (1971).
    </p>
    <p>
     When a criminal charge has been nol prossed and a second prosecution for the same offense has not been brought, respondent is premature in claiming the protection of this amendment against double jeopardy as grounds for judgment of acquittal on the first charge. State v. Woodmansee, 124 Vt. 387, 205 A.2d 407 (1964).
    </p>
    <p>
     The phrase "jeopardy of life or limb," as used in this amendment, while by strict construction extending only to treasons and felonies, applies to all indictable offenses, including misdemeanors. State v. O'Brien, 106 Vt. 97, 170 A. 98 (1934).
    </p>
    <p>
     A plea of former conviction must be upon a prosecution for the identical crime, and must make it to appear that the offenses charged in both cases are the same in law as well as in fact. State v. O'Brien, 106 Vt. 97, 170 A. 98 (1934).

    <p>
     In a prosecution for selling fireworks, although defendants contended that, since the court previously held the statute in question unconstitutional, the issue could not be relitigated, the State had not had a "full and fair" opportunity to litigate the statute's constitutionality in prior proceedings, and application of issue preclusion, or collateral estoppel, to the current proceedings would not have served the interests of justice. The State had made adequate efforts to appeal this issue in the prior case, and was denied that opportunity by both the trial court and the Supreme Court and, anyway, the State's incentive to litigate such a misdemeanor case was finite, especially when balanced against its scarce resources and overriding interest in prosecuting felonies. Also, the constitutionality of the fireworks statute would have remained an elusive issue if the doctrine of issue preclusion was continually applied to unappealable orders of the trial court. State v. Dann, 167 Vt. 119, 702 A.2d 105 (1997), cert. denied, Wurzberger v. Vermont, 522 U.S. 1112, 118 S. Ct. 1043, 140 L. Ed. 2d 108 (1998).

     Defendant was not in custody at the time of the questioning and thus was not entitled to Miranda warnings. The custody factors - particularly that a detective told defendant he was free to leave - indicated that a reasonable person in his situation would have felt at liberty to end the interview; the accusations of guilt and the detective's false statements were not enough, by themselves or under the totality of circumstances, to establish custody. State v. Lambert, - Vt.

    </p>
    <p>
     One-hour delay between when the Miranda warnings were administered and the more pointed questions leading to defendant's confession did not require fresh Miranda warnings. Not only was the subject of the interview consistent between the time of the warnings and defendant's confession, but the warnings were given in the same room as the subsequent interrogation, by the same officers who had been and were continuing to interview defendant. State v. Prue, 203 Vt. 123, 153 A.3d 551 (2016).
    </p>
    <p>
     Trial court properly found that defendant's initial waiver of his Miranda rights was voluntary, as the interview transcript and audio recording supported the trial court's findings that defendant followed the conversation, understood the nature of the interview, and knowingly and intelligently waived his rights; defendant's argument that there was no evidence that he knew the Miranda warnings were given because the troopers were going to question him about the homicide was not supported by the record; and the trooper's description of the constitutional requirement embodied in Miranda as a "formality" did not undermine the validity of defendant's waiver. State v. Prue, 203 Vt. 123, 153 A.3d 551 (2016).
    </p>
    <p>
     Defendant's confession was voluntary. Defendant knowingly and intelligently waived his right to remain silent after the troopers read him the Miranda warnings; defendant's statements throughout the interview reflected his understanding of his situation; the record did not reflect any improper promises; defendant was resistant to some of the interrogation tactics; defendant made repeated demands for additional evidence to inform his calculus of his own self-interest; the officers did not attempt to "sweat" out defendant; the troopers never crossed the line from being confrontational into being coercive; and although defendant was initially lured to the barracks through a ruse, he had multiple opportunities to terminate the interview. State v. Prue, 203 Vt. 123, 153 A.3d 551 (2016).
    </p>
    <p>
     Miranda warning given in the interrogation room after defendant's unwarned statement at the holding cell was effective to convey to defendant his rights to remain silent and to an attorney. Defendant gave little detail in his initial statement; the overlapping information between interviews was inconsequential; and the warned interview happened outside the realm of the first and was in no way based on earlier questions or responses. State v. Brooks, 193 Vt. 461, 70 A.3d 1014 (2012).
    </p>
    <p>
     There was no merit to defendant's contention that he did not voluntarily waive his rights following a Miranda warning. Defendant's continued assertion of innocence after waiving his rights strongly suggested that he did not consider his earlier statement to be incriminating and that, consequently, he did not feel manipulated or coerced by the first, unwarned interrogation; furthermore, defendant did not testify that he was pressured, coerced, or threatened into speaking. State v. Brooks, 193 Vt. 461, 70 A.3d 1014 (2012).
    </p>
    <p>
     Police who questioned defendant in a police cruiser for one hour engaged in a custodial interview of defendant without providing the necessary Miranda warnings. Defendant was not told he was free to leave; he was confronted with evidence of his guilt throughout; and defendant did not voluntarily initiate contact with police, but spoke with the detectives after they sought him out, waited for him to come home, and placed him inside the police car. State v. Hieu Tran, 193 Vt. 148, 71 A.3d 1201 (2012).
    </p>
    <p>
     In determining whether defendant was in custody for purposes of Miranda, there was no error in considering the officers' subjective belief in defendant's guilt. This belief was relevant because it was communicated to defendant during the questioning. State v. Hieu Tran, 193 Vt. 148, 71 A.3d 1201 (2012).
    </p>
    <p>
     Trial court did not err under Miranda in suppressing statements that defendant made early in his interview with police. From the outset of the questioning, there were indicia of custody and police dominance over defendant; thus, under the totality of the circumstances, the court could not say that defendant's statements even at the beginning of the interview were made in response to mere questioning rather than the product of a custodial interrogation. State v. Hieu Tran, 193 Vt. 148, 71 A.3d 1201 (2012).
    </p>
    <p>
     There was ample evidence to support the trial court's decision that defendant's waiver of his Miranda rights was valid. Defendant was twice informed of his Miranda rights and signed a written waiver form, a portion of which was read aloud to him, on the second occasion. State v. Robitaille, 191 Vt. 91, 38 A.3d 52 (2011).
    </p>
    <p>
     Trial court's discussion of the validity of the waiver of defendant's Miranda rights was sufficient, particularly given that defendant signed a written waiver attesting to his awareness of his rights and the consequences of waiving them. Moreover, while defendant testified that he had just finishing using six "Oxycontin 60s" when he was arrested, he stated that he was "awake" when the police officer was talking to him and "functional," which was further illustrated by his verbal exchanges with an officer, and he also testified that he sought to make a deal to prevent his girlfriend from getting into trouble. State v. Robitaille, 191 Vt. 91, 38 A.3d 52 (2011).
    </p>
    <p>
     Defendant was not in custody when he voluntarily entered a detective's vehicle; thus, Miranda warnings were not required. Defendant sought the interview and agreed to the location, and the officer began the interview in earnest by stating that defendant was not under arrest, was "free to leave at any time," and did not have to talk to the officer. State v. Barron, 189 Vt. 193, 16 A.3d 620 (2011).
    </p>
    <p>
     Although police interviewed defendant because he alleged that his wife had committed a crime, the interview necessarily included specific questions and answers about the conduct for which defendant had been charged. It was impossible to separate the questions about defendant's conduct from those about his wife's conduct; thus, defendant was subject to custodial interrogation without warnings, in violation of Miranda. State v. Barron, 189 Vt. 193, 16 A.3d 620 (2011).
    </p>
    <p>
     Given the independent basis for the seizure and search of a drug pouch, the fact that defendant told the officer what he was about to discover without having received Miranda warnings was of no moment. State v. Delaoz, 189 Vt. 385, 22 A.3d 388 (2010).
    </p>
    <p>
     Considering all the facts regarding the circumstances of defendant's interview, a reasonable person would have believed he was free to leave, and, thus, defendant was not in custody and officers were not obliged to inform him of his Miranda rights. While defendant had just confessed to three crimes that he believed to have been misdemeanors, the sergeants repeatedly told defendant that he was free to leave at any time, including after defendant's confession; the questioning was not coercive, defendant was unrestrained and had free access to an unlocked door, and the officers repeatedly assured him that he was free to leave; and the statement, "I want to talk to you for a little while longer," did not require defendant to continue the conversation, but merely expressed the officer's request and did not negate all the other police statements that defendant was free to leave at any time. State v. Oney, 187 Vt. 56, 989 A.2d 995 (2009).
    </p>
    <p>
     Defendant was not in custody when he made incriminating statements, considering the trial court's uncontroverted factual findings, which were not clearly erroneous and thus were binding on appeal, regarding the circumstances of defendant's questioning. The trial court made the following findings of fact: (1) defendant voluntarily left a convenience store to talk with the police; (2) defendant voluntarily went to the station and interview room; (3) the police could not have made it any clearer to him that he was there voluntarily, that he was free to leave, and that he could leave; (4) defendant was not handcuffed and had free access to an unlocked door; and (5) there was no evidence on a video or from any testimony that he was deprived of his freedom of action in a significant way. State v. Oney, 187 Vt. 56, 989 A.2d 995 (2009).
    </p>
    <p>
     Noncustodial situation does not become custodial automatically because the interviewee has confessed to a crime; a confession is just one of the circumstances to consider in evaluating whether a reasonable person would believe he or she were free to leave. Once a suspect confesses to committing a serious criminal act, this fact is significant in this evaluation; however, the severity of the crime confessed to affects the weight attributed to this factor. State v. Oney, 187 Vt. 56, 989 A.2d 995 (2009).
    </p>
    <p>
     Assuming, without deciding, that it was error for the trial court to allow the prosecution to elicit an officer's testimony during its case in chief regarding defendant's pre-arrest, pre-Miranda silence, such error was harmless. The cumulative nature of the offending testimony and the fact that defendant was the only potential perpetrator convinced the court that the outcome of the trial would not have been different had the officer's testimony been excluded. State v. Kulzer, 186 Vt. 264, 979 A.2d 1031 (2009).
    </p>
    <p>
     In a case where a detective should have known that his request to defendant, who had invoked his right to silence, was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response, the court declined the State's invitation to apply the United States Supreme Court's decision in a Fourth Amendment case involving good-faith reliance on a police database. How this radically different factual scenario - and the disparate legal framework under which the Court analyzed it - might inform the present court's analysis in a Fifth Amendment case was murky at best. State v. Christmas, 186 Vt. 244, 980 A.2d 790 (2009).
    </p>
    <p>
     Having never administered Miranda warnings and aware that defendant had invoked his right to remain silent, a detective directly asked him whether he was ready to talk about the crime for which he was under arrest, and about which he had earlier asserted his right to remain silent. This direct request for information was squarely contrary to Innis, as the detective should have known that such a request was reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response; consequently, the trial court properly suppressed defendant's statements. State v. Christmas, 186 Vt. 244, 980 A.2d 790 (2009).
    </p>
    <p>
     Suppression of defendant's statements about his alcohol consumption had no bearing on the outcome of his case because other evidence, including the result of a preliminary breath test and a trooper's observations, was sufficient to support the trooper's decision to arrest defendant for driving under the influence. Thus, any potential error under the Fifth Amendment and the Vermont Constitution was harmless. State v. McGuigan, 184 Vt. 441, 965 A.2d 511 (2008).
    </p>
    <p>
     When defendant was questioned at home before being taken to the police station, where he confessed after being given Miranda warnings for the first time, the Miranda warnings meaningfully informed defendant of his right to remain silent. The initial questioning elicited a minimal amount of detail from defendant; there was minimal overlap between the information elicited in the two interrogations; the settings were distinct and involved different officers as the primary questioners; and the second round of questioning was not continuous with the first in that defendant had not confessed during the initial interrogation. State v. Fleurie, 185 Vt. 29, 968 A.2d 326 (2008).

     Requiring defendant, as a condition of his probation after a conviction of sexual assault, to admit his guilt for sex-offender therapy without providing any sort of immunity or protection from repercussions of his admission violated the defendant's Fifth Amendment and Article 10 rights against self-incrimination, because a person in a probation setting cannot be forced to incriminate himself without first receiving immunity from criminal prosecution on the basis of the admission.

     Under this amendment's right against self-incrimination, it is impermissible for a governmental official investigating a defendant to remain silent as to the nature of the investigation when a legal or moral standard requires the official to reveal his or her purpose.

     Requiring defendant as condition of probation to admit during course of sexual therapy treatment program to having had sexual intercourse with stepdaughter violated his privilege against self-incrimination under this amendment, notwithstanding that, since defendant had been convicted only of lewd and lascivious conduct regarding incident with his stepdaughter about which he was being questioned in treatment program, threat of self-incrimination was not realistic as prosecution for different sexual acts against his stepdaughter on different days was unlikely; the burden of eliminating the threat of prosecution by assuring defendant that such admission would not be used against him was on the State. Mace v. Amestoy, 765 F. Supp. 847 (D. Vt. 1991).
    </p>
    <p>
     Since defendant convicted of sexual offense faced no threat of subsequent prosecution for the offense, this amendment and the Fourteenth Amendment did not prohibit conditioning probation on defendant's willingness to discuss, in the context of therapeutic treatment, the sexual issues surrounding the conviction even if disclosure of information could potentially lead to revocation of probation; the privilege against self-incrimination still operated to protect defendant with respect to further criminal prosecution of different acts.

     Since defendant convicted of lewd or lascivious conduct with a child retained no privilege against self-incrimination with respect to his actions surrounding the crime, probation condition requiring defendant to admit to having sexual intercourse with stepdaughter in context of sexual therapy program was permissible under this amendment, even though defendant theoretically could face prosecution for sexual acts with stepdaughter not the subject of the original charge and plea agreement; defendant made no showing of a realistic threat of self-incrimination associated with future prosecution.

     Trial court properly denied suppression of defendant's statements in the police cruiser and processing room prior to the commencement of formal questioning. While defendant was in custody when she made the statements, and invoked her right to counsel partway through the statements, police at no point did or said anything reasonably likely to elicit incriminating statements, meaning the statements were not the product of custodial interrogation; rather, defendant's statements were not in apparent response to anything police said or did but were part of a self-reflective monologue. State v. O'Neill, 209 Vt. 599, 209 A.3d 1213 (2019).

     Police officers' request for consent to search defendant's pick-up truck was not designed to elicit an incriminating response, and it therefore did not constitute "interrogation" within meaning of Fifth Amendment.

     Miranda warnings were required under this amendment when defendant employees of municipal water system were subjected to custodial interrogation by officials from Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in investigation of which defendants were targets; questions were designed to elicit incriminating responses and EPA investigators were acting under color of laws and regulations that compelled subjects to answer questions. United States v. Mitchell, 763 F. Supp. 1262 (D. Vt. 1991), reversed, 966 F.2d 92 (2d Cir. 1992).
    </p>
    <p>
     In order for questioning to constitute an interrogation giving rise to necessity of Miranda warnings under this amendment, questioning itself must be of a kind reasonably likely to elicit incriminating responses from the subject; although central focus is on subjective impression of the subject of investigation, law enforcement officials' intentions and knowledge of special susceptibilities of the subject at time of questioning are also relevant.

     Custodial interrogation is not defined by officer's or defendant's subjective intent or by officer's unarticulated purposes; rather, courts should evaluate how a reasonable man in the suspect's position would have understood the situation.

    <p>
     Defendant was not in custody and officers were not required to administer Miranda warnings where defendant was questioned briefly and told that he was not under arrest and that he could choose whether or not to accompany officers to search his residence, and defendant voluntarily accompanied officers to his home; custom agent's statement that he had "subject in custody" was police jargon and did not imply that defendant was not free to leave. United States v. Rakowski, 714 F. Supp. 1324 (D. Vt. 1987).
    </p>
    <p>
     Noncustodial questioning of defendant during search of his residence was not coercive where defendant was advised he had right to remain silent and to have counsel present, defendant was not in unfamiliar surroundings or unable to communicate with outsiders, and behavior of law enforcement officials did not overbear defendant's will to resist. United States v. Rakowski, 714 F. Supp. 1324 (D. Vt. 1987).

     Any knowledge the police may have had concerning the unusual susceptibility of a suspect to a particular form of persuasion may be an important factor in determining whether the police should have known that their words or actions were reasonably likely to elicit an incriminating response from the suspect.

     Trial court correctly determined that defendant was in police custody for the duration of the interview, as the totality of the relevant objective circumstances indicated that a reasonable person would not have felt at liberty to terminate the interview and leave. Although defendant arrived at the police barracks voluntarily, he was taken to a small, windowless room in the secure part of the police barracks; he was not told that he was free to terminate the interview and leave; and he was confronted almost immediately, and continuing throughout the interrogation, with evidence of guilt of a serious crime, sexual abuse of children. State v. Muntean, 189 Vt. 50, 12 A.3d 518 (2010).

     Standard for determining whether an interrogation is custodial is whether a reasonable person in defendant's position would have understood himself to be subjected to restraints comparable to those associated with a formal arrest.

     Defendant was not in custody for purposes of Miranda when a probation officer interviewed him in his home, as there was no evidence that the State would penalize an exercise of his Fifth Amendment self-incrimination privilege by revoking his furlough status, the questioning took place in his living room and was conducted by an officer he knew well, defendant knew that he was on the highest level of supervision, the initial questions were open-ended and even the later questions were not accusatory, and the fact that the officers were questioning him in response to a complaint and that they searched his bedroom were not indicators of custody. State v. Powers, 203 Vt. 388, 157 A.3d 39 (2016).

     Even if defendant's rights under Miranda and the Public Defender Act were violated by the State Police when they interrogated him, that violation did not taint the execution of a nontestimonial identification order. State v. Marallo, 175 Vt. 469, 817 A.2d 1271 (mem.) (2002).
    </p>
    <p>
     Defendant's statements were not taken in violation of his Fifth Amendment rights, where he freely and voluntarily waived his Miranda rights, officer's interviews with defendant occurred after the waiver, and there was no evidence that defendant told officer he wished to exercise any of his constitutional rights. United States v. Everett, 40 F. Supp. 2d 539 (D. Vt. 1999).
    </p>
    <p>
     Where defendant was informed of his rights under Miranda and chose to waive them, the Fifth Amendment did not require suppression of the statements he made at his home and at Drug Enforcement Agency headquarters. United States v. Zuber, 899 F. Supp. 188 (D. Vt. 1995).
    </p>
    <p>
     Where suspected illegal aliens were told that any statement they made could be used against them in an administrative proceeding, but were not told that they need not speak at all or that any statement could be used against them in a court of law, warnings were fatally deficient under Miranda, requiring suppression. United States v. Tehrani, 826 F. Supp. 789 (D. Vt. 1993), aff'd, 49 F.3d 54 (2d Cir. 1996).

     Miranda warnings are required prior to questioning when the questioning is an "interrogation" as defined in Miranda and its progeny, and is performed while the subject is in custody or a custody-like situation. United States v. Mitchell, 763 F. Supp. 1262 (D. Vt. 1991), reversed, 966 F.2d 92 (2d Cir. 1992).
    </p>
    <p>
     Procedural safeguards of Miranda apply only if a defendant is "in custody" and subjected to custodial interrogation; normally, the custody inquiry is whether, under totality of the circumstances, a reasonable person would believe he was at liberty to leave or to decline to answer the officer's questions. State v. Lancto, 155 Vt. 168, 582 A.2d 448 (1990).
    </p>
    <p>
     Questioning conducted in a police cruiser does not, in itself, establish custody for purposes of Miranda warnings; such questioning is not necessarily coercive, absent some evidence the officer's actions were calculated to break the suspect's will. State v. Lancto, 155 Vt. 168, 582 A.2d 448 (1990).
    </p>
    <p>
     Defendant's questioning, conducted in police cruiser, following trooper's determination that injured defendant was registered owner of car that trooper reasonably suspected of having been involved in an accident, was not custodial and therefore defendant was not entitled to Miranda warnings; the detention was brief, conducted on public highway by only one officer, and trooper's statement that he knew defendant had been in an automobile accident rather than in a fight as defendant claimed was insufficient to constitute a formal arrest. State v. Lancto, 155 Vt. 168, 582 A.2d 448 (1990).
    </p>
    <p>
     In determining whether waiver of Miranda rights is voluntarily made, where doubt is raised about defendant's capacity or physical ability to understand the nature of the asserted waiver, it is incumbent upon the trial court to inquire into all circumstances surrounding the interrogation, including defendant's age, experience, education, background, intelligence, and capacity to understand his Fifth Amendment rights and consequences of waiver. State v. Austin, 155 Vt. 531, 586 A.2d 545 (1990).
    </p>
    <p>
     Inquiring into the subjective thoughts of either the police or the defendant is likely to pervert the fact-finding process in a Miranda hearing, and such inquiry is not permissible. State v. Willis, 145 Vt. 459, 494 A.2d 108 (1985).
    </p>
    <p>
     In determining when a suspect has been taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom of action in any significant way for Miranda purposes, courts should make an objective inquiry into the totality of the circumstances to determine if a reasonable person would believe he or she were free to leave or refuse to answer police questioning. State v. Willis, 145 Vt. 459, 494 A.2d 108 (1985).
    </p>
    <p>
     Trial court erred in determining that defendant convicted of first degree murder was in custody when asked by the police if he wanted to show them where the victim's body was, where defendant was never specifically summoned for questioning, but walked into the officers' presence, defendant was asked only one simple question, phrased in a nonthreatening way, defendant was just outside his home when the question was asked, there was no discernible pressure or restraint of any sort on defendant, and the questioning lasted only seconds. State v. Willis, 145 Vt. 459, 494 A.2d 108 (1985).
    </p>
    <p>
     Although trial court erroneously concluded that defendant convicted of first degree murder had been in custody when asked by police if he wanted to show them where the victim's body was, there was no reversible error, since the court had refused to suppress the evidence of defendant's leading the police to the body on the ground that failure to give Miranda warnings before the question was asked was excused by an exception to the exclusionary rule. State v. Willis, 145 Vt. 459, 494 A.2d 108 (1985).
    </p>
    <p>
     When an individual is taken into custody or otherwise deprived of his freedom by the authorities in any significant way, he must be warned prior to any questioning that he has the right to remain silent, that anything he says can be used against him in a court of law, that he has the right to the presence of an attorney, and that if he cannot afford an attorney one will be appointed for him prior to any questioning if he so desires. State v. Shores, 143 Vt. 224, 465 A.2d 269 (1983).
    </p>

     Custodial interrogation resulting in a confession violates the privilege against self-incrimination secured by this amendment unless the prosecution clearly demonstrates that the defendant has received the safeguards required by Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), prior to interrogation and that he has knowingly and voluntarily waived his rights thereunder. State v. Breznick, 134 Vt. 261, 356 A.2d 540 (1976).
    </p>
    <p>
     Police officer's warning that defendant could not be compelled to answer and had the right to refuse to answer any questions while in custody, and that he was entitled to talk to a lawyer before answering any questions, was sufficient under Miranda v. Arizona, 384 U.S. 436 (1966), and it was not fatal that defendant was not advised he had the right to remain silent, that he was entitled to talk to a lawyer before any questions were asked, and that he could stop answering questions if he wished.

     Where defendant did not choose to remain silent, prosecutor's comments that at the time of his confession defendant did not claim that he had been in a trance state at the time of the shooting, were proper attacks on defendant's credibility and were not impermissible comments on post-arrest silence.

    <p>
     The appropriate test for analyzing whether a prosecutor's comments on a defendant's failure to testify infringed upon defendant's privilege against self-incrimination considers whether the remark was manifestly intended to be, or was of such a character that the jury would naturally and necessarily take it to be, a comment on the defendant's failure to testify.

     At sentencing for sexual assault, defendant's objection on Fifth Amendment grounds to inclusion in presentence investigation report of statements that he continued to deny guilt was without merit; defendant's speculation that admitting guilt at sentencing would have shown remorse and resulted in lighter sentence was unrealistic, where defendant took stand and proclaimed innocence at trial, and changing story and admitting guilt after trial would only have confirmed what sentencer may have suspected - that he lied at trial - and would have been perceived as self-serving.

     Under the totality of the circumstances, including defendant's prior experience with law enforcement and his assertions of innocence, detectives' psychological tactics - namely, telling defendant that he was not a malicious person and that victims of sexual assault often become abusive themselves - and their lie that a witness saw defendant accompany the victim into the woods did not overbear defendant's free will so as to render his statements involuntary. State v. Lambert, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (Apr. 30, 2021).
    </p>
    <p>
     In addition to the Fifth Amendment's prohibition against self-incrimination, the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment prevents admission of involuntary statements into evidence, regardless of the defendant's custodial situation. Thus, a court may not admit statements that were given involuntarily, regardless of whether Miranda warnings were administered or even necessary. State v. Pontbriand, 178 Vt. 120, 878 A.2d 227 (February 18, 2005).
    </p>
    <p>
     When a defendant challenges a confession or inculpatory statement, the prosecution must establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the confession or statement was made voluntarily, and that defendant knowingly waived the Fifth Amendment privilege.

     Trial court did not err in denying motion to suppress statements made by defendant to police officers while being taken to police barracks; although defendant was in custody, there was no evidence that he was being interrogated or that police had elicited his comments, and his statements were found to have been spontaneous and voluntary. State v. Karov, 170 Vt. 650, 756 A.2d 1236 (mem.) (2000).

     Where agents did not threaten defendant in any way and made no attempt to pressure him into confessing but instead provided defendant with his Miranda rights, and where defendant agreed to cooperate and then gave a statement detailing his involvement with cocaine distribution, his statement was fully voluntary.

     A defendant's confession, without any evidence of police coercion, may be voluntary, even where defendant is mentally ill and incapable of validly waiving right to remain silent. State v. Robinson, 158 Vt. 286, 611 A.2d 852 (1992).
    </p>
    <p>
     Introduction of an involuntary confession into evidence is prohibited by the United States Constitution and the Vermont Constitution; whether a confession is involuntary is determined by examining the totality of the circumstances, the ultimate question being whether police officers' threats, promises, or coercion were sufficient to overcome the defendant's free will or rational intellect, causing the defendant to confess. State v. Gilman, 158 Vt. 210, 608 A.2d 660 (1992).
    </p>
    <p>
     A trial court's findings in support of its decision to suppress or admit a confession must stand if they are supported by substantial evidence. State v. Gilman, 158 Vt. 210, 608 A.2d 660 (1992).
    </p>
    <p>
     Confession to burglary and assault was not the result of police pressure where defendant arrived at police barracks uninvited and was told he was free to leave; although the officers discussed benefits to him resulting from his becoming a confidential informant, they never promised he would not be prosecuted if he admitted having committed a serious felony unrelated to the subject of their discussion, drug crime.

     Trial court's decision to grant postconviction counsel's motion to withdraw was neither arbitrary nor uninformed, and was fully consistent with any minimal due process protections against arbitrary action that might apply in this context. After being ordered to take a second look at his proposed withdrawal, counsel spoke with petitioner, reread pertinent portions of the record, reconsidered petitioner's principal contention, and reviewed the case on which petitioner relied.

     Even if plaintiff, who sought to establish paternity after the mother and her partner had already been determined to be the child's legal parents, were found by genetic testing to be the child's biological father, he would not have a constitutionally protected parental interest that trumped the parentage statute's bar against subsequent parentage cases. Plaintiff did not seek to establish a legal tie to the minor child until more than two years after the child's birth; he never had any significant custodial, personal, or financial relationship with the minor child; and he had ample opportunity to formally declare and pursue his assertion of parentage through a voluntary acknowledgment of parentage or a parentage action in court.

    <p>
     While it is important to satisfy the due process rights of parents, the best interests of children must also be satisfied. Therefore, as long as the State uses due diligence to contact parents outside of Vermont, the lack of response should be no impediment to proceeding with termination if that is in the children's best interests.

     There was no merit to defendant's argument that his denial of bail violated federal due process. A presumption of incarceration under the statute regarding release in cases punishable by life imprisonment did not violate due process. State v. Brillon, 188 Vt. 537, 996 A.2d 1187 (mem.) (2010).

     Medical Practice Board's reliance on a supplemental affidavit submitted by the State's investigator did not deprive a physician whose license was summarily suspended of fair notice of the charges to be addressed. While the supplemental affidavit provided additional detail, it did not alter the basic charges against the physician or present an unfair surprise at the post-suspension hearing. In re Miller, 186 Vt. 505, 989 A.2d 982 (2009).
    </p>
    <p>
     There is no merit to the argument that the provision of the Administrative Procedure Act regarding licenses violates due process on its face by permitting a summary suspension in exigent circumstances. Indeed, consistent with the high court's recognition of an emergency exception to the pre-deprivation hearing requirement, numerous states have adopted identical or similar statutes based on a provision in the Model State Administrative Procedures Act authorizing the summary suspension of a state-issued license where public health, safety, or welfare imperatively requires emergency action. In re Miller, 186 Vt. 505, 989 A.2d 982 (2009).
    </p>
    <p>
     Within one month of a summary suspension order of a physician's license, the physician requested, and the Medical Practice Board promptly granted, an evidentiary hearing to reconsider the order. Therefore, any facial or as-applied due-process challenge to the provision of the Administrative Procedure Act regarding licenses predicated on the lack of a prompt post-suspension hearing was rendered moot. In re Miller, 186 Vt. 505, 989 A.2d 982 (2009).

    <p>
     Physician whose license was summarily suspended was afforded the opportunity to submit pre-filed testimony challenging the State's evidence, to cross-examine the State's investigator on the charges, and to testify in his own behalf. This was sufficient to satisfy the requisites of due process pending a more comprehensive final hearing on the merits. In re Miller, 186 Vt. 505, 989 A.2d 982 (2009).
    </p>
    <p>
     In a proceeding to summarily suspend a physician's license, the failure to admit four letters from the physician's former colleagues did not violate due process. To the extent that these were offered as testimonials to his good character, they were properly excluded as more appropriate to a merits hearing and ultimate questions relating to discipline and mitigation; to the extent that the letters contained information attesting to his judgment, they had some relevance to the question whether a remedy short of suspension would be sufficient to protect the public, but any error was harmless because it was clear that the Medical Practice Board implicitly considered and rejected the limited-remedy option.

     Statute that made it a federal crime for a convicted felon to knowingly possess a firearm "in or affecting commerce" was not unconstitutionally vague; in context of firearm control, it was well established that to fall within Commerce Clause a firearm need only have travelled previously in interstate commerce, and where defendant's firearms were inscribed with words "made in Massachusetts" and "made in West Germany," defendant was on notice that his firearms had traveled to Vermont, where he possessed them, via interstate commerce.

     Where a defendant claims that delay in the appellate process constituted a denial of due process, his showing of substantial prejudice must be based on concrete, practical considerations, rather than vague speculation unsupported by facts. State v. Hall, 145 Vt. 299, 487 A.2d 166 (1985).
    </p>
    <p>
     In order to sustain his burden of showing substantial prejudice, defendant who claims that delay in the appellate process constituted a denial of due process must establish that he has been unable to present an adequate appeal because of the delay, or that he will be unable to defend adequately in the event a retrial is ordered. State v. Hall, 145 Vt. 299, 487 A.2d 166 (1985).

    <p>
     Mere anxiety concerning the outcome of an appeal, without more, is not sufficient to show substantial prejudice resulting from delay in the appellate process. State v. Hall, 145 Vt. 299, 487 A.2d 166 (1985).
    </p>
    <p>
     Where defendant was unable to show any substantial prejudice resulting from a 17-month delay in producing the transcript of a pretrial motion, ordered to complete the record on appeal, because he made no claim that he was unable to present an adequate appeal and a retrial would not be ordered, the delay did not deny defendant his constitutional right to due process of law.

     Because a zoning ordinance requiring planned residential development (PRD) designs to protect important natural resources provided no guidance as to what might be fairly expected from landowners who owned a parcel containing wildlife habitat or scenic views and who wished to develop their property into a PRD, it violated property owners' due process rights.

     Right to counsel recognized in

      Escobedo
     </i>
     has been limited to arising only when the suspect is in police custody. State v. Oney, 187 Vt. 56, 989 A.2d 995 (2009).
    </p>
    <p>
     <i>
      Escobedo
     </i>
     applies only to a defendant's Fifth Amendment rights. Hence, Escobedo did not support defendant's claim that his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was violated. State v. Oney, 187 Vt. 56, 989 A.2d 995 (2009).
    </p>
    <p>
     Because defendant was not in custody, there was no violation of his Fifth Amendment right to counsel. Thus, the police were not obligated to stop questioning defendant even if he unequivocally asked to speak with a lawyer. State v. Oney, 187 Vt. 56, 989 A.2d 995 (2009).
    </p>
    <p>
     Defendant's waiver of his right to counsel was valid, where he was ineligible for a public defender and his actions indicated that he wanted counsel and understood his right to counsel, but made a conscious choice based on his financial situation to represent himself. State v. Stenson, 169 Vt. 590, 738 A.2d 567 (mem.) (1999).
    </p>
    <p>
     Fifth Amendment right to counsel protects an individual at pre-arraignment stage and thereafter whenever there is a custodial interrogation. United States v. Garey, 813 F. Supp. 1069 (D. Vt. 1993), aff'd, 19 F.3d 8 (2d Cir. 1994).
    </p>
    <p>
     Invocation of Sixth Amendment right to counsel does not imply an invocation of Fifth Amendment right, and police may question a suspect about crimes not formally charged even though suspect may have asserted his Sixth Amendment right as to other charges. United States v. Garey, 813 F. Supp. 1069 (D. Vt. 1993), aff'd, 19 F.3d 8 (2d Cir. 1994).
    </p>
    <p>
     Once an individual asserts his right to counsel under this amendment, all interrogation must cease until counsel is available; rule is not offense-specific, and suspect may not be reapproached regarding any offense unless counsel is present, although rule does not apply to suspects not in continuous custody. United States v. Garey, 813 F. Supp. 1069 (D. Vt. 1993), aff'd, 19 F.3d 8 (2d Cir. 1994).
    </p>
    <p>
     Even assuming defendant's Fifth Amendment right to counsel was invoked in earlier State proceeding, right was vitiated upon his release from State custody and did not apply to later questioning by federal agents relative to federal offenses. United States v. Garey, 813 F. Supp. 1069 (D. Vt. 1993), aff'd, 19 F.3d 8 (2d Cir. 1994).
    </p>
    <p>
     Trial court erred in failing to suppress statements of defendant in police custody for DUI processing who had asked for an attorney and spoken to one on the telephone but who had subsequently responded to police-initiated questioning; once defendant asked for counsel, regardless of what advice attorney gave over the telephone, there could be no further police-initiated questioning without presence of his attorney. State v. Parker, 155 Vt. 340, 583 A.2d 98 (1990).
    </p>
    <p>
     Before a preindictment suspect facing interrogation invokes the right to counsel, the right is in existence and available for exercise, but police-initiated interrogation will not be barred until the suspect requests the assistance of counsel. United States v. Roberts, 690 F. Supp. 1368 (D. Vt. 1988), reversed and remanded, 869 F.2d 70 (2d Cir. 1989).
    </p>
    <p>
     Once an accused has invoked the right to counsel, the Edwards rule prohibits police-initiated interrogation about either the same offense or an unrelated offense and any waiver of the right to counsel for that police-initiated interrogation is invalid. United States v. Roberts, 690 F. Supp. 1368 (D. Vt. 1988), reversed and remanded, 869 F.2d 70 (2d Cir. 1989).
    </p>
    <p>
     The Sixth Amendment right to counsel parallels the Fifth Amendment right to counsel in two ways: (1) before the Edwards rule will bar police-initiated questioning, the right to counsel must be invoked; and (2) before the right to counsel is invoked, Miranda warnings are sufficient to inform the accused of his right to counsel and to obtain a valid waiver of that right. United States v. Roberts, 690 F. Supp. 1368 (D. Vt. 1988), reversed and remanded, 869 F.2d 70 (2d Cir. 1989).
    </p>
    <p>
     Defendant, while being accused of charges respecting which he had previously waived his Sixth Amendment right to counsel, could validly waive his Fifth Amendment right to counsel in connection with police questioning regarding an offense for which he had not been charged. United States v. Roberts, 869 F.2d 70 (2d Cir. 1989).
    </p>
    <p>
     Once a criminal defendant has invoked Fifth Amendment right to counsel, he is not subject to further interrogation by authorities until counsel has been made available to him, unless accused himself initiates further communication, exchanges, or conversations with police, and if authorities initiate further interrogation, any waiver of defendant's right to counsel for that interrogation is invalid. State v. Preston, 150 Vt. 511, 555 A.2d 360, cert. denied, 488 U.S. 934, 109 S. Ct. 327, 102 L. Ed. 2d 345 (1988).

    <p>
     Broad interpretation must be given to defendant's request for counsel, and court must presume, absent evidence to contrary, that such an individual has invoked full extent of constitutional right to counsel.

    </p>

     When defendant had requested an attorney at arraignment on another charge, and while in custody was interrogated and purportedly waived his right to counsel following a Miranda warning, his waivers of his Fifth Amendment right were invalid and his confession to murder charge was inadmissible. State v. Preston, 150 Vt. 511, 555 A.2d 360, cert. denied, 488 U.S. 934, 109 S. Ct. 327, 102 L. Ed. 2d 345 (1988).

     Landowner was not entitled to relief under a theory of inverse condemnation based on snow throw and water runoff caused by snowplowing done by the Vermont Agency of Transportation. There was no allegation that the Agency had created a permanent physical occupation of landowner's property; the intermittent snow throw and water runoff here was an incidental incursion only and did not represent the kind of invasion that would amount to a taking; and the burden of receiving snow throw and water runoff was distributed among all property owners who abutted properly maintained highways, even if the landowner's building was closer to the road than the buildings of other landowners.

    </p>
    <p>
     The prohibition on takings without compensation is not absolute. An exercise of the police power to abate a public nuisance, and specifically, to abate a fire hazard, is not a compensable taking. Thus, where the State seeks to sustain regulation that deprives land of all economically beneficial use, it may refuse to compensate a property owner only if the regulation prohibits a use of the land that was "not part of his title to begin with". When the challenged State action is consistent with background principles of the State's law of property and nuisance, no property interest has been taken, and no just compensation is due. Alger v. Department of Labor & Industry, 181 Vt. 309, 917 A.2d 508 (2006).
    </p>
    <p>
     Even though Vermont law allows a tenant to remain in a dwelling after a landlord's violation of the warranty of habitability, this does not mean that tenants are entitled to remain in a building when doing so threatens the surrounding community, as in cases where occupancy of the building poses a fire hazard. Accordingly, to the extent plaintiffs' claims challenged the ultimate decision of defendant Vermont Department of Labor and Industry to order that their homes be vacated or their utility service be terminated, their allegations did not state valid takings claims. Alger v. Department of Labor & Industry, 181 Vt. 309, 917 A.2d 508 (2006).
    </p>
    <p>
     Plaintiff tenant's complaint stated valid takings claims where it alleged that defendant Vermont Department of Labor and Industry knew of relevant code violations, and that in the face of the landlords' refusal to take corrective action, it chose to allow the violations to continue until they became serious enough to require removal of the plaintiffs or termination of utility service. But for defendant's failure to act, there would have been no nuisance to abate, and plaintiffs' property would not have been taken. If plaintiffs could prove the allegations, they would be entitled to just compensation. Alger v. Department of Labor & Industry, 181 Vt. 309, 917 A.2d 508 (2006).
    </p>
    <p>
     Under the Takings Clauses of the Vermont and U.S. Constitutions, the property interest lost need not be an ownership interest; a leasehold is an interest in property subject to analysis under the Takings Clause. Moreover, the loss need not be permanent; a temporary taking of property can be compensable. Alger v. Department of Labor & Industry, 181 Vt. 309, 917 A.2d 508 (2006).
    </p>
    <p>
     The prohibition of the Vermont and U.S. Constitutions against takings of private property for public purposes without compensation applies not only when the government takes property for its own use through the formal procedures of eminent domain, but also when government regulation results in the loss of a property interest. Alger v. Department of Labor & Industry, 181 Vt. 309, 917 A.2d 508 (2006).

     Enactment of statute providing for reorganization of domestic mutual insurance companies into mutual insurance holding companies did not effect an unconstitutional taking, since it could not be interpreted to have denied policyholders the economically viable use of their property.

     Developer's substantive due process and regulatory takings claims were not ripe for review, where developer had never sought compensation in Vermont State courts in connection with denial of land use permit; since Vermont Supreme Court recognized cause of action under State Constitution for compensation for taking of property generally, developer could not establish that Vermont's procedure was either unavailable or inadequate.

     Environmental Board's denial of application for land use permit was not a final decision, and developer's substantive due process and regulatory takings claims were not ripe for review, where developer submitted only one permit application and it was not clear whether board would deny approval for all uses that would enable developer to derive economic benefit from property, and it could be inferred that Board would be receptive to a subdivision proposal that placed lots in different segment of property so as to minimize impact on deeryard.

      1. Motor vehicle license suspension.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     State administrative motor vehicle license suspension procedure is not criminal, and defendant is not entitled to a jury trial, appointed counsel, protection against self-incrimination, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, or confrontation of witnesses, as those protections apply to criminal proceedings. State v. O'Brien, 158 Vt. 275, 609 A.2d 981 (1992).

      2. Speedy trial
     </b>
     .
    </h5>
    <p>
     18-month delay between arraignment and trial did not deprive defendant of his right to a speedy trial, as the majority of the delay was attributable to the withdrawal of several defense attorneys, the stipulated discovery and trial-ready schedule designed to accommodate the ordinary needs of trial preparation, and defense counsel's unavailability. Moreover, defendant complained about the delay but did not move for an immediate trial or take other action, and defendant did not maintain that his ability to defend himself was impaired in a specific way. State v. Lafaso, - Vt.
    - , 251 A.3d 935 (Jan. 29, 2021).
    </p>
    <p>
     <b>
      * Purpose.
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     Speedy trial protections are triggered by either a formal indictment or information or else the actual restraints imposed by arrest and holding to answer a criminal charge. State v. Beer, 177 Vt. 245, 864 A.2d 643 (October 1, 2004).
    </p>
    <p>
     Although delay prior to arrest or indictment may give rise to a due process claim under the Fifth Amendment, or to a claim under any applicable statutes of limitations, no Sixth Amendment right to a speedy trial arises until charges are pending. State v. Beer, 177 Vt. 245, 864 A.2d 643 (October 1, 2004).
    </p>
    <p>
     When there are no charges outstanding, personal liberty is certainly not impaired to the same degree as it is after arrest while charges are pending. State v. Beer, 177 Vt. 245, 864 A.2d 643 (October 1, 2004).
    </p>
    <p>
     The right to a prompt trial protects an accused, if he is confined, against prolonged imprisonment prior to the determination of guilt or innocence, protects him against prolonged anxiety and public embarrassment, and protects him from the hazards of excessive delay that might deprive him of witnesses in his behalf or dull their memories in the recall of the event and circumstances relevant to the charge. State v. Mahoney, 124 Vt. 488, 207 A.2d 143 (1965); State v. Dragon, 130 Vt. 570, 298 A.2d 856 (1972).

      *3. Factors for determining violation of right.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     Defendant's speedy trial rights under the Sixth Amendment and the Vermont Constitution had not been violated by the 23-month delay. Only five months of the delay were clearly attributable to the State, and while defendant timely asserted his speedy trial right, he was out on bail the entire time and had identified few specific claims of prejudice. State v. Reynolds, 196 Vt. 113, 95 A.3d 973 (2014).
    </p>
    <p>
     Defendant's detention as a material witness was not for the purpose of answering a criminal charge, and it did not trigger defendant's speedy trial rights. State v. Beer, 177 Vt. 245, 864 A.2d 643 (October 1, 2004).

     Defendant's speedy trial rights did not attach until her indictment, and therefore, the trial court properly rejected her speedy trial claim. State v. Beer, 177 Vt. 245, 864 A.2d 643 (October 1, 2004).
    </p>
    <p>
     Trial court properly determined defendant's right to speedy trial was not violated where period of delay, excluding delays occasioned by defendant's search for private counsel, his absence from the jurisdiction, public defender's motion to withdraw, and other motions and continuances, did not exceed 90 days. State v. Lavalette, 154 Vt. 426, 578 A.2d 108 (1990).
    </p>
    <p>
     Defendant was not denied speedy trial where allegation of prejudice was unsupported, defendant never asserted speedy trial right, six-and-a-half months between arraignment and trial was only short period beyond administrative order standard for prompt disposition of criminal cases, defendant was not incarcerated, and delay was caused by difficulty in scheduling long trial. State v. Venman, 151 Vt. 561, 564 A.2d 574 (1989).
    </p>
    <p>
     Defendant was not denied speedy trial, despite 17-month delay, where defendant was not incarcerated, he completed college education and obtained employment, and State did not show bad faith, even though one witness died prior to trial and two other witnesses allegedly suffered impaired recall of details, and some delay was attributable to court system. State v. Yudichak, 151 Vt. 400, 561 A.2d 407 (1989).
    </p>
    <p>
     Defendant's right to speedy trial was not violated, even though seven months elapsed between arrest and trial and defendant was in jail, where delays were caused by discovery and scheduling, defendant did not assert right until over five months after arraignment, and defendant did not make specific allegations of prejudice or anxiety. State v. Roy, 151 Vt. 17, 557 A.2d 884 (1989).

     There are four factors that are relevant in determining when a denial of the right to a speedy trial has occurred: the length of the delay, the reason for the delay, defendant's assertion of his or her right, and prejudice to the defendant. State v. Recor, 150 Vt. 40, 549 A.2d 1382 (1988).

     In examining a claim that speedy trial rights have been violated, at least four factors are relevant: length of the delay, reason for the delay, defendant's assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant. State v. Snide, 144 Vt. 436, 479 A.2d 139 (1984).
    </p>
    <p>
     Length of delay between arrest and criminal trial is a triggering mechanism, and if long enough may require consideration of factors of length of delay, reason for it, defendant's assertion of his right, and prejudice to defendant, in determining whether right to a speedy trial has been violated. State v. Unwin, 139 Vt. 186, 424 A.2d 251 (1980), cert. denied, 450 U.S. 1033, 101 S. Ct. 1746, 68 L. Ed. 2d 229 (1981).

     Although length of delay in bringing a defendant to trial is not dispositive of the constitutional question of denial of the right to a speedy trial, and at most operates as a triggering device for further inquiry, as a threshold matter the Supreme Court demands an accurate determination of the time elapsed from the time of incarceration to the date of trial.

     Given that defendant largely brought delay upon himself through his motion practice and refusal of earlier trial dates, defendant was not denied a speedy trial. State v. Burke, 192 Vt. 99, 54 A.3d 500 (2012), cert. denied, 568 U.S. 1072, 133 S. Ct. 795, 184 L. Ed. 2d 588 (2012).
    </p>
    <p>
     While there was a nine-month delay between arraignment and trial on defendant's charge of lewd and lascivious conduct, the delay was neither long nor prejudicial enough to have constituted a Sixth Amendment speedy-trial violation in light of defendant's less than aggressive assertion of the right. The delay was not extreme in relation to either the nature of the case or the minimum delay needed to trigger judicial examination; an apparent scheduling error caused just over one month of delay, and defendant did not claim that any part of an unexplained three-month delay could have been avoided by the diligence of the trial court; defendant had not aggressively asserted his speedy-trial right; and he had not shown prejudice. State v. Vargas, 185 Vt. 629, 971 A.2d 665 (mem.) (2009).
    </p>
    <p>
     Thirty-four month incarceration between arrest and trial did not violate defendant's right to speedy trial, where he caused majority of delay himself and he alleged no prejudice other than being incarcerated before trial. State v. Crannell, 170 Vt. 387, 750 A.2d 1002 (2000), overruled, State v. Brillon, 2008 VT 35, 183 Vt. 475, 955 A.2d 1108.

     In determining whether a defendant's trial is improperly delayed more than 90 days, delays occasioned by pretrial motions, continuances granted by the court, absences of the defendant, and changes of counsel are omitted. State v. Lavalette, 154 Vt. 426, 578 A.2d 108 (1990).
    </p>

     Delay arising out of the relationship between attorney and client must be attributed to defendant and omitted from consideration of motion to dismiss for lack of a speedy trial. State v.

     Delays attributable to proceedings necessary to determine competency to stand trial and pretrial motions are excluded from consideration in determining whether defendant was deprived of his right to a speedy trial. State v. Messier, 146 Vt. 145, 499 A.2d 32 (1985).
    </p>
    <p>
     Where defendant, who was convicted of aggravated assault and kidnapping, failed to present any specific claims of prejudice resulting from the delay between the time of his incarceration to the date of his trial, the reasons for the delay were defense-requested continuances and defendant's court-ordered psychiatric examination at the State Hospital, to which all parties acquiesced, and the record revealed that the State was prepared to go forward to trial when defendant requested the continuances, defendant's constitutional right to a speedy trial was not infringed. State v. Williams, 143 Vt. 396, 467 A.2d 667 (1983).
    </p>
    <p>
     Where the delay in trial was caused as much by the failure of the defendant to prepare his defense as it was on the State to move for a speedier trial and defendant was afforded a trial in less than a month from the time he first started to prepare his defense and there was no showing he was hindered in efforts to prepare a defense or that the delay had caused him anxiety, concern, or embarrassment, the delay involved was not a denial of the right of speedy trial. State v. Dragon, 130 Vt. 570, 298 A.2d 856 (1972).

     Accused was not denied a speedy trial, harassed, or subjected to oppressive use of the State's accusative powers where he was indicted for manslaughter on Nov. 4, 1968, the case was set for a hearing on Dec. 10, 1968, and the State nol prossed it on that date and immediately filed an information charging manslaughter and four other offenses, and accused, following denial of his motion to quash the information, appealed by interlocutory order, which resulted in the lower court proceeding being delayed pending decision of that appeal.

    </p>
    <p>
     Defendant's claim that he was subjected to anxiety, embarrassment, and loss of employment because he was compelled to wait an inordinate amount of time before his case came to trial amounted to nothing more than an unsupported assertion that delay is per se prejudicial and was not sufficient to show prejudice.

State v. Rusin, 153 Vt. 36, 568 A.2d 403 (1989).

    </p>
    <p>
     An information must set forth charges with such particularity as will reasonably indicate the exact offense the accused is charged with, and will enable her to make intelligent preparation for her defense; to satisfy this requirement, an essential fact, affecting the degree of punishment, must be alleged in the information. State v. Bradley, 145 Vt. 492, 494 A.2d 129 (1985).
    </p>
    <p>
     An information is sufficient if it sets forth charges with such particularity as will reasonably indicate the exact offense the accused is charged with, and will enable her to make intelligent preparation for her defense, and this is not a subjective inquiry as to what the accused actually understood, but rather a scrutiny of the charge, as made, to determine what offense is reasonably indicated by its language. State v. Phillips, 142 Vt. 283, 455 A.2d 325 (1982).

     Trial court did not infringe upon defendant's constitutional right to cross-examine the victim's mother. Defense counsel had been questioning the mother for quite some time before the trial court asked counsel to "move along" and "wrap this up" within 15 minutes, and defendant did not point to the evidence defense counsel would have elicited had he been given more time to cross-examine the mother. State v. Lambert, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (Apr. 30, 2021).
    </p>
    <p>
     Trial court did not violate the Confrontation Clause by excluding testimony about the maximum sentence of 15 years a cooperating witness faced at the time he agreed to testify, as defendant was able to elicit testimony that the witness received a reduced sentence in exchange for his agreement to testify, which satisfied the Luciano-Mosquera approach by exposing potential biases, and that he received 15 years, reduced to three years to serve if he complied with probation, which satisfied the Chandler approach. State v. Robitille, 210 Vt. 202, 213 A.3d 437 (2019).
    </p>
    <p>
     Victim's statements to a police officer were testimonial under the Confrontation Clause in that the officer was focused on getting a statement rather than addressing an ongoing emergency. The officer arrived 15 minutes after the initial report, other officers were already on the scene, the officer testified that he was trying to calm the victim so she could give a statement, and there was no evidence that defendant was believed to be at or near the scene. State v. Alers, 199 Vt. 373, 123 A.3d 825 (2015).
    </p>
    <p>
     Trial court did not deny defendant's Sixth Amendment right to confrontation by prohibiting evidence that the complainant had lied about having an abortion. The episode did not concern a material issue or a topic of direct examination, and defendant had already introduced evidence of the complainant's untruthfulness. State v. Lawrence, 194 Vt. 315, 80 A.3d 58 (2013).
    </p>
    <p>
     Assuming, without deciding, that counsel could in some circumstances stipulate to a waiver of a defendant's Confrontation Clause rights pursuant to a prudent trial strategy, in this case, where defendant timely objected to such a waiver on the record, the purported waiver was invalid. Accordingly, the trial court erred in admitting the out-of-court testimony of the witness over defendant's objection. State v. Tribble, 193 Vt. 194, 67 A.3d 210 (2012).
    </p>
    <p>
     In a murder trial, the trial court's Confrontation Clause error in admitting a preservation deposition of a medical examiner who was out of the country was not harmless, as the Court could not conclude that the jury would have convicted defendant of murder without the testimony. The testimony was an important part of the State's case, especially insofar as it provided substantial support to the State's rebuttal of defendant's own account of his confrontation with the victim, and the testimony was not cumulative. State v. Tribble, 193 Vt. 194, 67 A.3d 210 (2012).
    </p>
    <p>
     Absent a valid waiver, the Constitution does not except "preservation deposition" testimony from the requirements of the Confrontation Clause. State v. Tribble, 193 Vt. 194, 67 A.3d 210 (2012).
    </p>
    <p>
     Witness who was working out of the country was not unavailable for Confrontation Clause purposes when he indisputably indicated his willingness to return from New Zealand for the trial and stated that he would require a business class ticket. The only two impediments to his testifying at the trial were inconvenience and cost, which had been expressly rejected as factors sufficient to support a finding of unavailability. State v. Tribble, 193 Vt. 194, 67 A.3d 210 (2012).
    </p>
    <p>
     Vermont Supreme Court has found no authority to support the proposition that counsel can stipulate to the admission of out-of-court testimony thereby waiving a defendant's Confrontation Clause rights in the face of the defendant's express objection. State v. Tribble, 193 Vt. 194, 67 A.3d 210 (2012).
    </p>
    <p>
     Defendant's right to confrontation was not violated by the admission of laboratory reports as business records. They were procured at the instigation of defendant and his employer, not by police, almost a year before criminal charges were filed; the fact that the information could conceivably be used for future litigation did not establish that it was prepared for litigation rather than in the normal course of the laboratory's business. State v. Erwin, 189 Vt. 502, 26 A.3d 1 (2011).
    </p>
    <p>
     Trial court did not violate the Sixth Amendment in admitting a videotape of the child victim's interview. The victim testified prior to the admission of the videotape, but defendant was entirely free to recall her to the stand for cross-examination; he did not, and therefore he could not show that his right to confront adverse witnesses was violated. State v. Hoch, 189 Vt. 560, 18 A.3d 562 (mem.) (2011).
    </p>
    <p>
     Since the excluded evidence here was admissible, and was directed toward undermining the credibility of the State's sole direct witness, the right to confrontation was implicated. State v. Herring, 189 Vt. 211, 19 A.3d 81 (2010).
    </p>
    <p>
     In prohibiting defendant from presenting the full range of evidence on an incident where the complainant stated that she vomited profusely when defendant had her drink an over-the-counter remedy after forcing her to perform oral sex, the trial court not only blocked an arguably valid tactical decision, but also foreclosed defendant from his constitutional right to confrontation. The ruling was not justified by avoidance of undue prejudice to defendant, since it was directly waived by defendant's own request, and was unexplained by the trial court in terms of other balancing to exclude relevant evidence. State v. Herring, 189 Vt. 211, 19 A.3d 81 (2010).
    </p>
    <p>
     Trial court does not commit plain error by admitting, upon the parties' stipulation, a videotaped deposition in lieu of the declarant's live testimony. Accordingly, defendant could not now claim error under the Confrontation Clause regarding the course of action he impliedly, if not explicitly, agreed to, and there was no basis for finding plain error; furthermore, defendant did not explain how he was prejudiced by admission of the victim's recorded statements. State v. Spooner, 188 Vt. 356, 8 A.3d 469 (2010).
    </p>
    <p>
     Defendant's cross-examination of a detective was not nearly as limited as defendant claimed. The trial court properly recognized that defendant could use otherwise inadmissible information to impeach the detective, but only to the extent that the detective opened the door, and defendant was permitted to elicit testimony from the detective that highlighted what defendant viewed as deficiencies in the investigation. State v. Godfrey, 187 Vt. 495, 996 A.2d 237 (2010).
    </p>
    <p>
     Trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding that there was no direct connection between two third parties and the crime charged and thus did not err in not allowing defendant to cross-examine a detective about those two parties. Defendant had established no direct link between the third parties and the crime of which he was accused, but merely gathered together a number of remote acts, unsubstantiated statements, and unconnected activities or proclivities to try to implicate others; furthermore, much of the evidence that defendant wished to introduce against these third parties was inadmissible hearsay not falling under any exception. State v. Godfrey, 187 Vt. 495, 996 A.2d 237 (2010).
    </p>
    <p>
     Given how attenuated the evidence of third-party guilt was, if any probative value could have been gleaned from such evidence, it was substantially outweighed by the significant potential for confusing the jury, and the trial court therefore properly excluded it. Thus, the trial court did not err in limiting defendant's cross-examination of a detective regarding a possible third-party perpetrator. State v. Godfrey, 187 Vt. 495, 996 A.2d 237 (2010).
    </p>
    <p>
     Trial court did not improperly prevent defendant from cross-examining the victim regarding bruises on her face when she picked up her children from their paternal grandfather. Because the court excluded the testimony of the grandfather, an exclusion defendant had not challenged on appeal, there was no foundation for the cross-examination, and the victim's statement to the police indicated that she would deny that she had been bruised at all; thus, the questions were likely to produce no evidence of probative value but to create a substantial risk of prejudice. State v. Forty, 187 Vt. 79, 989 A.2d 509 (Nov. 25, 2009).
    </p>
    <p>
     In determining whether a hearsay statement is testimonial under the Sixth Amendment, the fact that a complainant is injured may be relevant if the complainant requires emergency medical attention, because such injuries would themselves constitute the kind of bona fide physical threat mentioned by the United States Supreme Court in
     <i>
      Davis.
     </i>
     But these injuries must create an ongoing emergency to trigger the exception for nontestimonial hearsay explained in
     <i>
      Davis.
     </i>
     State v. Shea, 184 Vt. 453, 965 A.2d 504 (2008).
    </p>
    <p>
     Initial basic information disclosed by the complainant to an officer, including the name of the perpetrator, was nontestimonial for purposes of the Sixth Amendment because the evidence objectively showed that the officer faced an emergency situation and that he questioned the complainant for the purpose of resolving that emergency. The officer did not know the extent of the complainant's injuries or whether the perpetrator was on or near the scene, and he needed to identify the perpetrator in order to prevent him from harming anyone on the scene; furthermore, he was acting to resolve the emergency, as was shown by the facts that he obtained only minimal information, conducted a very unstructured interview, and searched the apartment for defendant. State v. Shea, 184 Vt. 453, 965 A.2d 504 (2008).
    </p>
    <p>
     In determining whether a hearsay statement is testimonial under the Sixth Amendment, the main factors for analysis are: (1) whether the emergency was ongoing because the crime was being committed at the time of the hearsay statement or because the complainant or officer was in imminent physical danger; and (2) whether the officer's primary purpose was to resolve an emergency or to investigate a possible criminal act. State v. Shea, 184 Vt. 453, 965 A.2d 504 (2008).

    </p>
    <p>
     The primary objective of the right to confront witnesses is to assure, where possible, personal examination and cross-examination of the witnesses, in which the accused has an opportunity not only to test their recollection and sift their conscience, but also to compel them to stand face to face with the jury in order that the jury may look at them and judge by their demeanor and manner of testimony whether they are worthy of belief. State v. Berard, 132 Vt. 138, 315 A.2d 501, cert. denied, 417 U.S. 950, 94 S. Ct. 3078, 41 L. Ed. 2d 671 (1974).

     Right of confrontation is a trial right that is not implicated by pretrial discovery restrictions, and therefore rape shield statute's prohibition against deposing complaining witnesses concerning prior sexual conduct did not violate defendant's Sixth Amendment rights. State v. Roya, 167 Vt. 594, 708 A.2d 908 (mem.) (1998).
    </p>
    <p>
     While the defendant's right to present a defense and confront adverse witnesses may, in appropriate cases, bow to accommodate other legitimate interests in the criminal trial process, restrictions on this right may not be arbitrary or disproportionate to the purposes they are designed to serve; a defendant's Sixth Amendment rights may be violated by a discovery sanction that entirely excludes a defendant's proffered evidence. State v. Passino, 161 Vt. 515, 640 A.2d 547 (1994).
    </p>
    <p>
     The rights conferred by this amendment are not absolute; an exception to the right of confrontation is made when an unavailable witness has given testimony at a prior proceeding provided the proponent of the hearsay evidence establishes the unavailability of the declarant and satisfies the court that the proffered testimony possesses indicia of reliability sufficient to evaluate the truth of the prior statement. State v. Roberts, 154 Vt. 59, 574 A.2d 1248 (1990).

    <p>
     In determining whether prior testimony of a now-unavailable witness at defendant's murder trial possessed sufficient indicia of reliability to justify its admission under the prior testimony exception to the hearsay rule in defendant's present kidnapping trial, this amendment did not require a particularized search for such indicia of reliability in the testimony itself; rather, the accouterments of the murder trial itself and the motivation it provided defendant to cross-examine witness satisfies requirement of trustworthiness.

     The right to confrontation is basically a trial right that includes both the opportunity to cross-examine and the occasion for the jury to weigh the demeanor of the witness. State v. Sprague, 144 Vt. 385, 479 A.2d 128 (1984).
    </p>

     Rights of an accused in a criminal prosecution to confrontation and cross-examination are not absolute; those rights may, in certain cases, be outweighed by the interest of the State and the victim in excluding certain evidence. State v. Patnaude, 140 Vt. 361, 438 A.2d 402 (1981).

     While the Confrontation Clause guarantees the opportunity to effectively cross-examine a witness as part of defendant's right of confrontation, it does not follow that the right to cross-examine is denied by the State whenever the witness' lapse of memory impedes one method of discrediting him. State v. Carter, 156 Vt. 437, 593 A.2d 88 (1991).

    <p>
     Where accomplice on cross-examination by defendant testified that he could not recall whether a charge against him unrelated to the present proceeding had been dismissed in exchange for his testimony, the trial court's refusal to admit the accomplice's criminal records did not violate the Confrontation Clause since the record as a whole demonstrated that defendant had an adequate opportunity to demonstrate through cross-examination the possible bias of the accomplice, including the fact that charges against the accomplice in the present proceeding had been dismissed. State v. Carter, 156 Vt. 437, 593 A.2d 88 (1991).
    </p>
    <p>
     Trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to permit defendant to reopen cross-examination of witness five days after he had testified, for the purpose of exploring issues raised during direct and cross-examination of the witness on the first day of trial, where there was no reason that the questioning could not be completed fully during the initial cross-examination. State v. Valley, 153 Vt. 380, 571 A.2d 579 (1989).
    </p>
    <p>
     Right to confrontation is not unlimited; trial judge retains a wide degree of discretion to impose reasonable limits on cross-examination when there is a risk of harassment, prejudice, confusion of the issues, the witness' safety, or interrogation that is repetitive or only marginally relevant.

     Defendant was not denied right of confrontation at sexual assault trial by the court's failure to order expert witness to testify as to his professional relationship with the juvenile complainant, since expert testified about the unique psychological effects of sexual abuse on children, and did not testify specifically about the juvenile complainant; fact that expert and juvenile complainant had a professional relationship did not, by itself, suggest bias.

     Threshold question in examining Confrontation Clause claim is whether defendant was prohibited from engaging in otherwise appropriate cross-examination. State v. French, 152 Vt. 72, 564 A.2d 1058 (1989).

     Trial court's ruling, that cross-examination of witness regarding bad check charge which had been dropped after the amount of the checks had been paid was prejudicial, was within its discretion and did not violate defendant's right to confrontation.

     Trial court's ruling sustaining prosecution's objection to cross-examination of witness to show inconsistency in her testimony did not violate defendant's right to confrontation, where question requiring witness to repeat her statement at earlier trial that account of facts during deposition was closer to truth than statements made during the trial was more prejudicial than probative and was cumulative, and defense counsel's other questions of witness inquired into veracity. State v. French, 152 Vt. 72, 564 A.2d 1058 (1989).

     The Confrontation Clause of this amendment guarantees an opportunity for effective cross-examination, not cross-examination that is effective in whatever way, and to whatever extent, the defense might wish.

    <p>
     In child sexual assault case where trial court permitted defendant to cross-examine prosecution's expert witness about whether, in her opinion, a prior sexual assault by another person might have been an alternative cause of the victim's post-traumatic stress disorder, refusal to allow defendant to cross-examine the victim about the prior sexual assault did not deny defendant his right of confrontation. State v. Catsam, 148 Vt. 366, 534 A.2d 184 (1987).
    </p>

     The crux of a Confrontation Clause violation is the lack of an effective opportunity to cross-examine the person whose statement is being used against the defendant. State v. Tedesco, 147 Vt. 133, 513 A.2d 1164 (1986), overruled on other grounds, State v. Gallagher, 150 Vt. 341, 554 A.2d 221, cert. denied, 488 U.S. 995, 109 S. Ct. 563, 102 L. Ed. 2d 588 (1988).
    </p>
    <p>
     There was no Confrontation Clause violation where there was no denial of an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses, even though the effectiveness of such cross-examination was limited because of the witnesses' failure of memory. State v. Paquette, 146 Vt. 1, 497 A.2d 358 (1985).
    </p>
    <p>
     The right to confront witnesses is an adoption of the common law, and insofar as this right covers cross-examination, it is subject to the common law exceptions and limitations. State v. Berard, 132 Vt. 138, 315 A.2d 501, cert. denied, 417 U.S. 950, 94 S. Ct. 3078, 41 L. Ed. 2d 671 (1974).

     At parole violation hearing on charge that defendant had violated parole by traveling outside the State without his probation officer's permission, where affidavit of out-of-state police officer was presented but the police officer was not present, the defendant was denied his right to confront the witness as provided by the Confrontation Clause.

     Although the rule allowing a child witness in a sexual-assault case to testify without hearing or seeing the defendant in certain circumstances could on its face unconstitutionally allow for an exception to a defendant's confrontation rights without a sufficient showing, the trial court here made a constitutionally sufficient finding to support its ruling. In particular, after making findings about the trauma the child experienced in connection with the events giving rise to this prosecution, and her reaction to attempts to discuss the topic, the trial court found that it was highly likely that the child would completely shut down and respond in a very strong emotional manner; thus, the trial court found a high likelihood - not just a substantial risk - that the victim would be traumatized and that the trauma would impair her ability to testify. State v. Bergquist, 210 Vt. 102, 211 A.3d 946 (2019).
    </p>
    <p>
     Witness's excited utterance to defendant's cousin shortly after defendant threatened to kill him was not testimonial because his statement was not made in the context of a formal interrogation or other structured environment; rather, he was excitedly expressing his fear to a friend, and, therefore, the Confrontation Clause did not bar admission of his hearsay statement against defendant. State v. Wilkinson, 178 Vt. 174, 879 A.2d 445 (April 8, 2005), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1063, 126 S. Ct. 798, 163 L. Ed. 2d 630 (2005).

     Severance of trials, due to incriminating post-arrest statements of co-defendants, was not required to protect moving defendants' confrontation rights under this amendment, where government stated it would not introduce statements and would redact any reference to movants which might be contained in co-defendants' admissions. United States v. Washington, 819 F. Supp. 358 (D. Vt. 1993), cert. denied, 515 U.S. 1151, 115 S. Ct. 2596, 132 L. Ed. 2d 843 (1995).

     To allow admission of former testimony against criminal defendant, the witness must be unavailable despite the State having made a "good-faith" effort to obtain his presence at trial, the length to which the State must go in producing the witness being a question of reasonableness. State v. Lynds, 158 Vt. 37, 605 A.2d 501 (1991).
    </p>
    <p>
     Requirement of V.R.E. 804a, the hearsay exception for statements of putative child victims, that the child victim be available to testify, does not violate the Confrontation Clause of this amendment. State v. Gallagher, 150 Vt. 341, 554 A.2d 221, cert. denied, 488 U.S. 995, 109 S. Ct. 563, 102 L. Ed. 2d 588 (1988).

     On issue of admission of former testimony against defendant, the State bears the burden of establishing a witness' unavailability. State v. Lynds, 158 Vt. 37, 605 A.2d 501 (1991).
    </p>
    <p>
     When a witness who cannot be present at trial has given earlier testimony subject to cross-examination by the defendant, the testimony may be admitted as an exception to the Confrontation Clause if the prosecution demonstrates that the declarant is unavailable and satisfies the court that the prior testimony bears sufficient indicia of reliability. State v. Carroll, 147 Vt. 108, 513 A.2d 1159 (1986).
    </p>
    <p>
     For purposes of exception to Confrontation Clause allowing admission of testimony of an unavailable witness who has given earlier testimony subject to cross-examination by the defendant, the witness is not unavailable unless the prosecutorial authorities have made a good-faith effort to obtain his presence at trial. State v. Carroll, 147 Vt. 108, 513 A.2d 1159 (1986).
    </p>

     Prior testimony subject to an opportunity for adequate cross-examination by the defendant will ordinarily exhibit sufficient indicia of reliability to allow for its admission at trial. State v.

     Defendant, who was questioned after he had been charged with disorderly conduct and after counsel had been appointed, was not afforded counsel during the questioning and did not waive counsel, and the questioning related to the offenses for which counsel had been appointed. Thus, a detective violated defendant's Sixth Amendment rights. State v. Barron, 189 Vt. 193, 16 A.3d 620 (2011).
    </p>
    <p>
     Because a confession was not a fruit of an interview where there had been a Sixth Amendment violation, the interview did not provide grounds to suppress the confession. State v. Barron, 189 Vt. 193, 16 A.3d 620 (2011).
    </p>
    <p>
     Even if defendant was questioned about his alleged disorderly conduct and his allegation that his wife and a minor complained against him so they could engage in sexual activity unhindered by him, that violation of the Sixth Amendment provided him no help in his claim that his confession to a different crime, sexual assault, had to be suppressed. There was no question that disorderly conduct and sexual assault were separate offenses; thus, defendant's Sixth Amendment right did not prevent the detective from questioning him about the alleged sexual assault before charging him with that offense. State v. Barron, 189 Vt. 193, 16 A.3d 620 (2011).

    <p>
     Sixth Amendment right to counsel attaches at the initiation of judicial criminal proceedings, whether the judicial proceedings have been initiated by way of formal charge, preliminary hearing, indictment, information, or arraignment. Because judicial criminal proceedings had not yet been initiated against defendant at the time of the interview, his Sixth Amendment right to counsel was not violated, even if defendant unambiguously requested counsel.

     The Sixth Amendment right to counsel parallels the Fifth Amendment right to counsel in two ways: (1) before the Edwards rule will bar police-initiated questioning, the right to counsel must be invoked; and (2) before the right to counsel is invoked, Miranda warnings are sufficient to inform the accused of his right to counsel and to obtain a valid waiver of that right.

     Where defendant at DUI trial was denied appointed counsel on basis of sentence forecast predicting he would not be incarcerated and defendant acting pro se pled guilty, and upon presentation of additional facts the trial court determined incarceration might be appropriate, defendant's constitutional right to assistance of counsel was preserved by the trial court's offer to defendant to withdraw his guilty plea.

     The rights of a talkative inmate are not violated when a jailmate acts in an entrepreneurial way to seek information of potential value, without having been deputized by the government to question that defendant. The informant probably engaged the defendant in conversation in the hope that the informant would get something valuable to take to the police, but the informant's agreement with the State about other matters did not make the informant a roving agent. Absent solicitation, there was no constitutional violation. United States v. Birbal,, 113 F.3d 342 (2d Cir. 1997).
    </p>
    <p>
     Because the right to counsel does not attach until after the initiation of formal charges, defendant had no argument that his rights were violated by jailmate informant's testimony when defendant was not indicted for the other offense until after the conversation occurred.

     Actions specifically prohibited by the arson-causing-death statute are defined by reference to the victim, and a defendant may therefore be charged with multiple counts of arson causing death where multiple deaths result from the same act of setting a fire. Thus, counsel was not ineffective for not raising a multiplicity challenge. In re Williams, 197 Vt. 39, 101 A.3d 151 (2014).
    </p>
    <p>
     Defense counsel was not ineffective for ceasing his search for a fire expert after the one he retained offered no criticism of the police investigation. The fact that petitioner eventually found an expert who offered an opinion more helpful to his position did not demonstrate that defense counsel was ineffective for failing to obtain similar testimony prior to the guilty plea. In re Williams, 197 Vt. 39, 101 A.3d 151 (2014).
    </p>
    <p>
     At sentencing in a case where three children and their grandmother died in a fire started when defendant set fire to a trash can, defense counsel was ineffective when he did not conduct any independent investigation, present testimony, or prepare a sentencing memorandum but instead offered a few remarks about petitioner's childhood, essentially repeating the information in the presentence investigation report. In re Williams, 197 Vt. 39, 101 A.3d 151 (2014).
    </p>
    <p>
     Defects in defense counsel's performance at sentencing supported a finding of actual prejudice, given the highly unusual gap between the minimum sentences of 20 and 50 years allowed by the plea agreement, the need to give the sentencing judge reasons to impose a sentence at the low end of the permitted range, the need to develop the positive information about petitioner that appeared in a brief sketch of a few pages in the presentence investigation report, and the need to stand up to the strong emotional feelings present in the courtroom. In re Williams, 197 Vt. 39, 101 A.3d 151 (2014).
    </p>
    <p>
     Counsel was not ineffective for advising petitioner to plead guilty. Defense counsel devoted significant time and attention to the case prior to the change of plea and after concluding that the evidence against petitioner was strong, recommended that petitioner accept the State's offer to plead guilty in exchange for amending the charges to involuntary manslaughter. In re Williams, 197 Vt. 39, 101 A.3d 151 (2014).
    </p>
    <p>
     Petitioner was not entitled to postconviction relief on the grounds that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel and that his guilty pleas were not entered knowingly and voluntarily. Under the case law at the time, it was reasonable for counsel to doubt the merit of raising a multiplicity challenge to the child pornography statute; because this assessment was not unreasonable, it did not create a material misunderstanding upon which petitioner based his guilty pleas. In re Kirby, 192 Vt. 640 (mem.), 58 A.3d 230 (2012).
    </p>
    <p>
     Trial counsel was ineffective when she failed to obtain expert testimony to refute the most important - and weakest - element in the State's case: whether petitioner fired his gun at the complaining witness. Because intent to injure was the central element to a charge of aggravated assault, the issue of shot direction was vital to the State's case; counsel actually bolstered the State's case by eliciting damaging testimony from a State's witness, and she hamstrung petitioner's case by lacking rebuttal evidence to support the contention that directionality could not be determined based on a muzzle flash. In re Russo, 187 Vt. 367, 991 A.2d 1073 (2010).
    </p>
    <p>
     A defendant who raises a challenge to his conviction on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel must show by a preponderance of the evidence: (1) that counsel's conduct fell below the prevailing standard of competency, and (2) that this failure to meet the standard contributed to the adverse outcome. In re Trombly, 160 Vt. 215, 627 A.2d 855 (1993).
    </p>
    <p>
     Counsel's representation was within range of acceptable assistance when, in advocating client's chosen strategy to limit possible verdicts, counsel urged court to exclude manslaughter instruction and instruct only on first and second degree murder.

    <p>
     Juvenile did not receive effective assistance of counsel, where counsel did not adequately explain to his parents and him the right to not speak with police and the consequences of confession, juvenile was allowed to face police interrogation unaccompanied by counsel, giving the police significant evidence when it was doubtful police had enough evidence to convict prior to the interview, and counsel failed to consider before allowing interview whether State was willing to settle matter without litigation. In re J.B., 159 Vt. 321, 618 A.2d 1329 (1992).
    </p>
    <p>
     Juvenile's counsel's failure to subject prosecution case to meaningful adversary testing was a denial of juvenile's Sixth Amendment rights to effective assistance, and, thus, the adversary process became presumptively unreliable; no specific showing of prejudice was required beyond that.

     A criminal defendant's right to reasonably effective assistance of counsel is guaranteed by both State and U.S. Constitutions, and court will apply same test under each Constitution to determine whether right has been violated. In re Ross, 158 Vt. 122, 605 A.2d 524 (1992).

    <p>
     A defendant challenging adequacy of his counsel's assistance must show by preponderance of evidence that counsel's conduct fell below prevailing standard of a reasonably competent attorney, and that failure to meet that standard prejudiced defendant such that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, result of proceeding would have been different. In re Ross, 158 Vt. 122, 605 A.2d 524 (1992).
    </p>
    <p>
     Defense counsel's failure to object to expert testimony regarding credibility of child victim at sexual assault trial constituted ineffective assistance requiring new trial, where counsel had raised and briefed that issue before trial, State had conceded before trial that such testimony was improper, and there was a reasonable probability the outcome would have been different had counsel objected, since expert testified at end of case and improperly bolstered victim's testimony. In re Ross, 158 Vt. 122, 605 A.2d 524 (1992).
    </p>
    <p>
     A defendant who challenges adequacy of counsel's assistance must show by a preponderance of evidence, first, that counsel's conduct does not measure up to prevailing standard of reasonably competent attorney, and second, that counsel's failure to meet standard prejudiced defendant such that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, result of proceeding would have been different.

    <p>
     When the specter of conflicts of interest arises, the District Court (1) must establish whether the attorney, in fact, labors under an actual or a potential conflict, and, if so, (2) must then ensure that the conflict is either eliminated or waived. United States v. Lussier, 71 F.3d 456 (2d Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1105, 116 S. Ct. 1321, 134 L. Ed. 2d 474 (1996).
    </p>
    <p>
     When a District Court learns of even the possibility of a conflict of interest, it must inquire into the details of the attorney's interests to determine whether the conflict is actual, potential, or nonexistent; failure to fulfill this obligation constitutes per se reversible error. United States v. Lussier, 71 F.3d 456 (2d Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1105, 116 S. Ct. 1321, 134 L. Ed. 2d 474 (1996).
    </p>
    <p>
     When a possible conflict of interest is established, the District Court then had the more demanding task of determining whether the conflict could be resolved by a waiver, or whether counsel had to be disqualified; if a conflict is so egregious that no rational defendant would knowingly and voluntarily desire the attorney's representation, then the court must disqualify the attorney. United States v. Lussier, 71 F.3d 456 (2d Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1105, 116 S. Ct. 1321, 134 L. Ed. 2d 474 (1996).
    </p>
    <p>
     When a defense attorney cross-examines a former client who is a witness against the defendant, a conflict of interest may exist; absent a waiver from the former client, the attorney cannot inquire into privileged matters. United States v. Lussier, 71 F.3d 456 (2d Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1105, 116 S. Ct. 1321, 134 L. Ed. 2d 474 (1996).
    </p>
    <p>
     To secure a valid waiver of a potential conflict of interest, the court must: (1) advise the defendant about potential conflicts; (2) determine whether the defendant understands the risks of those conflicts; and (3) give the defendant time to digest and contemplate the risks, with the aid of independent counsel if desired. United States v. Lussier, 71 F.3d 456 (2d Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1105, 116 S. Ct. 1321, 134 L. Ed. 2d 474 (1996).
    </p>
    <p>
     When a court fails to obtain from the defendant an adequate waiver of the conflict, the defendant still has not suffered ineffective assistance of counsel unless his attorney has either (1) a potential conflict of interest that resulted in prejudice to the defendant; or (2) an actual conflict of interest that adversely affected the attorney's performance; an attorney labors under an actual, as opposed to a potential, conflict when, during the course of the representation, the attorney's and defendant's interests diverge with respect to a material factual or legal issue or to a course of action. United States v. Lussier, 71 F.3d 456 (2d Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1105, 116 S. Ct. 1321, 134 L. Ed. 2d 474 (1996).

     Where defendant knowingly and voluntarily waived his attorney's potential conflict of interest, he was not denied effective assistance of counsel. United States v. Lussier, 71 F.3d 456 (2d Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 517 U.S. 1105, 116 S. Ct. 1321, 134 L. Ed. 2d 474 (1996).
    </p>
    <p>
     To establish a violation of this amendment due to ineffective assistance of counsel resulting from divided loyalties on the part of trial counsel, a defendant who has raised no objection at trial must establish that counsel's active representation of the opposing interest adversely affected the assistance he provided the accused. Lace v. United States, 606 F. Supp. 50 (D. Vt. 1984), aff'd, 762 F.2d 990 (2d Cir. 1985), cert. denied Ducharme v. United States, 528 U.S. 1144, 120 S. Ct. 996, 145 L. Ed. 2d 943 (2000).

     The right to challenge the propriety of an appointment of counsel on the basis of diversity of interests may be waived by an accused, and where a guilty plea is voluntarily made, it waives the right to contend that there was a conflict of interest between defendants represented by the same counsel.

     The press and public have a qualified right of access to affidavits of probable cause, which must be balanced with defendant's right to a fair trial. Greenwood v. Wolchik, 149 Vt. 441, 544 A.2d 1156 (1988).
    </p>
    <p>
     Trial court correctly denied petitioner's motion to continue order sealing affidavits of probable cause, where petitioner presented evidence of no more than the mere possibility of prejudice if the contents of the affidavits became public. Greenwood v. Wolchik, 149 Vt. 441, 544 A.2d 1156 (1988).
    </p>
    <p>
     To rebut the presumption that pretrial criminal proceedings and documents are open to the public, party seeking closure must demonstrate that closure is essential to preserve higher values and is narrowly tailored to serve that interest. Greenwood v. Wolchik, 149 Vt. 441, 544 A.2d 1156 (1988).
    </p>
    <p>
     The First Amendment right of access to pretrial proceedings and documents is not an absolute right, especially when defendant's right to trial by an impartial jury might be jeopardized by public disclosures prior to trial. Greenwood v. Wolchik, 149 Vt. 441, 544 A.2d 1156 (1988).
    </p>
    <p>
     A court can temporarily seal an affidavit of probable cause upon a preliminary examination of the likelihood of adverse publicity and its potential effect on the accused's right to a fair trial; however, such an order must be carefully drawn to afford the maximum recognition of the rights of both the defendant and the public. Greenwood v. Wolchik, 149 Vt. 441, 544 A.2d 1156 (1988).
    </p>
    <p>
     Pretrial criminal proceedings and documents are presumably open to the public, closure being the exception rather than the rule. State v. Tallman, 148 Vt. 465, 537 A.2d 422 (1987).

      43. Miranda warning
     </b>
     .
    </h5>
    <p>
     Defendant, a 15-year-old juvenile, was "in custody" while being questioned by the police at his foster home without being apprised of his Miranda rights in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments and the Vermont Constitution. The officer did not expressly inform him that he was free to terminate the questioning; furthermore, the officer communicated his belief in defendant's guilt by asking him where the stolen car was, defendant's foster parent was present but discussed the importance of honesty and doing the right thing, and while the interview took place in a home setting, defendant had been there only six to eight weeks and had been recently reported as a runaway. In re E.W., 198 Vt. 311, 114 A.3d 112 (2015).
    </p>
    <p>
     Procedural safeguards of Miranda apply only if a defendant is "in custody" and subjected to custodial interrogation; normally, the custody inquiry is whether, under totality of the circumstances, a reasonable person would believe he was at liberty to leave or to decline to answer the officer's questions. State v. Lancto, 155 Vt. 168, 582 A.2d 448 (1990).
    </p>
    <p>
     Questioning conducted in a police cruiser does not, in itself, establish custody for purposes of Miranda warnings; such questioning is not necessarily coercive, absent some evidence the officer's actions were calculated to break the suspect's will. State v. Lancto, 155 Vt. 168, 582 A.2d 448 (1990).
    </p>
    <p>
     Defendant's questioning, conducted in police cruiser, following trooper's determination that injured defendant was registered owner of car which trooper reasonably suspected of having been involved in an accident, was not custodial and therefore defendant was not entitled to Miranda warnings; the detention was brief, conducted on public highway by only one officer, and trooper's statement that he knew defendant had been in an automobile accident rather than in a fight as defendant claimed was insufficient to constitute a formal arrest. State v. Lancto, 155 Vt. 168, 582 A.2d 448 (1990).

    </h5>
    <p>
     Testimony of arresting officer, that defendant had had several prior contacts with police, was reliable and could be used to determine whether defendant waived Miranda rights, since it was based on information officer acquired from court documents, conversations with other police officers, defendant's parole officer and defendant himself, and from computer checks. State v. Towne, 158 Vt. 607, 615 A.2d 484 (1992).

      46. Presence of defendant.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     Because defendant was present at the initial sentencing, the trial court reimposed the same minimum sentence, and the trial court had no discretion in correcting the maximum sentence, defendant had no right to be present when the court imposed the corrected sentence. His absence could not thwart a fair and just hearing. State v. Tobin, 208 Vt. 518, 199 A.3d 1069 (2018).
    </p>
    <p>
     Defendant had a right under the Sixth Amendment and the Vermont Rules of Criminal Procedure to be present at the hearing on his motion to suppress, as the trial court conducted a full evidentiary hearing, heard testimony, and entered findings, and this was not a case where the only issue was one of law and the outcome could not have been affected by his absence. State v. Grace, 204 Vt. 68, 165 A.3d 122 (Nov. 18, 2016).
    </p>
    <p>
     Where a court is asked to make factual findings based on the evidence presented at a suppression hearing, a defendant must be accorded the right to be present in order to confront the witnesses arrayed against him or her, to assist counsel in formulating a defense, and ultimately to ensure a fair hearing and reliable result. State v. Grace, 204 Vt. 68, 165 A.3d 122 (Nov. 18, 2016).
    </p>
    <p>
     Defendant had not waived the right to be present at the suppression hearing, as the general written waiver of appearance he signed merely tracked the language of the rule governing a defendant's presence in providing for a waiver of appearance at status conferences and "arguments on questions of law"; furthermore, while defense counsel appeared to acquiesce in the hearing going forward, his explanation for defendant's absence made it clear that it was not based on a knowing and voluntary waiver by defendant of his right to be present in that counsel stated that he had sent defendant a notice of the hearing but had not explained to defendant his need to be present in person. State v. Grace, 204 Vt. 68, 165 A.3d 122 (Nov. 18, 2016).

    </h5>
    <p>
     In expressing its unwillingness to continue the case when there was a risk that an ill witness could be readmitted to the hospital shortly before a rescheduled trial, the trial court prioritized speed over defendant's right to present a defense. This insistence on speed, in the face of a justifiable request for continuance, violated both the Sixth Amendment and the Vermont Constitution. State v. Heffernan, 206 Vt. 261, 180 A.3d 579 (Dec. 1, 2017).

     39 of Vermont Constitution and this amendment. State v. Venman, 151 Vt. 561, 564 A.2d 574 (1989).

      2. Bail.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     When defendant was charged with grand larceny and assault and robbery with a dangerous weapon, the amount of his $150,000 bail was not improper under the Vermont bail statute or excessive under the Eighth Amendment, as he was facing serious charges involving the use of a dangerous weapon that carried a potential 25-year sentence, he had two failures to appear and two probation violations, and he used a Maine address and had allegedly gone to Maine after the charged crimes. State v. Dunn, 196 Vt. 467, 93 A.3d 1057 (2014).
    </p>
    <p>
     A prisoner charged with any offense, unless in execution, or for a capital offense when the proof is evident or presumption great, has a right to bail provided by this amendment. State v. Toomey, 126 Vt. 123, 223 A.2d 473 (1966).
    </p>
    <p>
     Ability of the accused to furnish bail, nature of the offense, penalty for the offense charged, character and reputation of the accused, health of the accused, character and strength of the evidence, probability of the accused appearing at trial, and whether the accused was a fugitive from justice when arrested are factors to be taken into account by the court in determining the amount of bail. State v. Toomey, 126 Vt. 123, 223 A.2d 473 (1966).

      3. Excessive fines.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     Forfeiture of 1650 cases of liquor valued at approximately $100,000 was remedial, rather than punitive, and was therefore not subject to Excessive Fines Clause of the Eighth Amendment; case involved an in rem civil forfeiture proceeding in which State proceeded against property rather than its owner, and forfeited liquor was contraband, the value of which could be viewed as liquidated damages for costs to State of enforcing its liquor control laws. In re 1650 Cases of Seized Liquor, 168 Vt. 314, 721 A.2d 100 (1998).
    </p>
    <p>
     Excessive Fines Clause of this amendment does not apply to awards of punitive damages in case between private parties. Browning-Ferris Industries v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U.S. 257, 109 S. Ct. 2909, 106 L. Ed. 2d 219 (1989).
    </p>
    <p>
     At the time of drafting and ratification of this amendment, "fines" was understood to mean payment to a sovereign as punishment for some offense. Browning-Ferris Industries v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U.S. 257, 109 S. Ct. 2909, 106 L. Ed. 2d 219 (1989).
    </p>
    <p>
     Excessive Fines Clause of this amendment was intended to limit only those fines directly imposed by, and payable to, the government. Browning-Ferris Industries v. Kelco Disposal, Inc., 492 U.S. 257, 109 S. Ct. 2909, 106 L. Ed. 2d 219 (1989).

      4. Cumulative punishment.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     District Court's enhancement of sentence based upon facts contained in dismissed count of indictment did not violate defendant's rights under this amendment, where resulting 18-month sentence was 102 months less than statutory maximum. United States v. Streich, 987 F.2d 104 (2d Cir. 1993).
    </p>
    <p>
     Penalty for multi-count prosecution is not unfair by mere fact that cumulative punishments may be imposed for distinct offenses. State v. Venman, 151 Vt. 561, 564 A.2d 574 (1989).
    </p>
    <p>
     Constitutional inhibition of unusual punishments and excessive fines has no application to cumulative punishments imposed for distinct offenses in the same prosecution. State v. O'Neil, 58 Vt. 140, 2 A. 586 (1886), appeal dismissed, 144 U.S. 323, 12 S. Ct. 693, 36 L. Ed. 450 (1892).

      5. Punishment proportionate to offense.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     Vermont law reflects the State's enhanced concern for the protection and well-being of minors and the gravity it attaches to crimes involving the exploitation of minors. There are no grounds upon which to conclude that the Legislature's policy choice regarding the sentence for aggravated sexual assault of a child runs counter to the Eighth Amendment. State v. Bellanger, 206 Vt. 489, 183 A.3d 550 (Mar. 3, 2017).
    </p>
    <p>
     Petitioner's sentence of life without parole for attempted murder did not violate the Eighth Amendment's prohibition on cruel and unusual punishment based on disproportionality. Petitioner planned to kill the victim in a particularly cruel and painful manner, burning her to death in his van, and his culpability was not diminished by the fact that neighbors intervened; moreover, the trial court heard evidence that petitioner had previously shot at his family members, who escaped by sheer luck. In re Stevens, 195 Vt. 486, 90 A.3d 910 (2014).
    </p>
    <p>
     Potential punishment of ten years in jail for each count of multi-count prosecution for knowingly filing false claims with State Medicaid program was not grossly disproportionate to offense; comparable federal crime was felony, misdemeanor penalties were found by Congress to be inadequate deterrents, maximum penalties for Medicaid fraud in other states were similar, and some penalties for comparable Vermont crimes were felonies. State v. Venman, 151 Vt. 561, 564 A.2d 574 (1989).

        Sixth Amendment guarantees defendant, through this amendment, an impartial jury. State v. Jenne, 156 Vt. 283, 591 A.2d 85 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Proportional Contribution Clause of the Vermont Constitution and the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution impose the same limits on the State's powers of taxation. Burlington Electric Dept. v. Vermont Department of Taxes, 154 Vt. 332, 576 A.2d 450 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since defendant convicted of sexual offense faced no threat of subsequent prosecution for the offense, the Fifth Amendment and this amendment did not prohibit conditioning probation on defendant's willingness to discuss, in the context of therapeutic treatment, the sexual issues surrounding the conviction even if disclosure of information could potentially lead to revocation of probation; the privilege against self-incrimination still operated to protect defendant with respect to further criminal prosecution of different acts. State v. Gleason, 154 Vt. 205, 576 A.2d 1246 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont law relating to former jeopardy has, through the operation of this amendment, become the law of the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment. In re Dunkerley, 135 Vt. 260, 376 A.2d 43 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Federal double jeopardy standards of the Fifth Amendment apply to the states by way of this amendment. State v. Lebo, 129 Vt. 449, 282 A.2d 804 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        This amendment secures against State invasion the same privilege that the Fifth Amendment guarantees against federal infringement-the right of a person to remain silent until he chooses to speak in the unfettered exercise of his own will, and to suffer no penalty for such silence. State v. Miner, 128 Vt. 55, 258 A.2d 815 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Use of evidence secured by police through an unreasonable search and seizure is barred in State prosecutions by the Fourth and this amendment. State v. Barr, 126 Vt. 112, 223 A.2d 462 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right of an accused in a criminal prosecution to the assistance of counsel under the Sixth Amendment is made obligatory upon the states under this amendment. In re Shuttle, 125 Vt. 257, 214 A.2d 48 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        The requirements of due process under this amendment carry over to the State courts the prohibitions of the Fourth Amendment. State v. Ball, 123 Vt. 26, 179 A.2d 466 (1962).

       <p>
        The police power may be exerted in the form of State legislation where otherwise the effect may be to invade rights guaranteed by this amendment only when such legislation bears a real and substantial relationship to the public health, safety, morals, or some other phase of public welfare. State v. Solomon, 128 Vt. 197, 260 A.2d 377 (1969).

        Since 23 V.S.A.
        §
        1256, requiring persons operating and riding upon motorcycles to wear protective headgear, applies to all motorcyclists equally, is directly related to highway safety, bears a real and substantial relation to the promotion of the welfare and safety of the general public as distinguished from the welfare solely of the individual motorcycle riders, does not deprive a motorcyclist of his liberty or restrain his person or actions, and protects persons in other vehicles from exposure to danger created by a motorcycle out of control, it is clearly within the State's police power and, accordingly, does not violate this amendment. State v. Solomon, 128 Vt. 197, 260 A.2d 377 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        The police power cannot be invoked for the protection of one class of citizens against another unless it is in reality for the protection of the public in general. 1960-62 Op. Atty. Gen. 65.
       </p>
       <p>
        Police power legislation does not come within this amendment unless it is apparent that its real object is not to protect the community, or to promote the general well-being, but, under the guise of police regulation, to deprive the owner of his property without due process of law. Sowma v. Parker, 112 Vt. 241, 22 A.2d 513 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        The State possesses wide discretion with respect to making classifications in exercise of its police power, with the qualification that a classification must not be purely arbitrary or irrational, but based upon a real and substantial difference, having a reasonable relation to the subject of the particular legislation. State v. Auclair, 110 Vt. 147, 4 A.2d 107 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        An ordinance legally enacted by a municipality, within police power delegated by Legislature, has force of State law, and its validity is to be measured by provisions of this amendment. Village of St. Johnsbury v. Aron, 103 Vt. 22, 151 A. 650 (1930).

        </b>
        .
       </h5>
       <p>
        Town's practice of assigning additional home-site values to permitted subdivisions had a rational basis and was constitutionally valid under the Equal Protection Clause and Vermont's Proportional Contribution Clause. There was a sufficient difference between lots with actual permits in place and lots that were potentially subject to division without a permit to justify the different treatment by the town. Lathrop v. Town of Monkton, 195 Vt. 564, 91 A.3d 378 (Jan. 24, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Resign-to-run restriction was not irrational for purposes of equal protection; it applied only to judges because it was imposed by the Vermont Supreme Court, which had power only over judges. It reflected the national recognition, however, that one had to protect the fairness, and perceived fairness, of judicial decision-making and minimize the distraction of election campaigns. In re Hodgdon, 189 Vt. 265, 19 A.3d 598 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that defendant's conduct was punishable under either the aggravated murder statute or under the first-degree murder statute, which contained different penalties, did not violate equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. Because the circumstances were indistinguishable from those in the United States Supreme Court's decision of
        <i>
         Batchelder,
        </i>
        the broad holding of
        <i>
         Batchelder
        </i>
        foreclosed defendant's requested relief under the Fourteenth Amendment. State v. Rooney, 189 Vt. 306, 19 A.3d 92 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was premature to dismiss inmates' claim that not allowing them stamps violated equal protection. The fact that the inmates were housed out-of-state did not alone show that they were not situated similarly with in-state inmates for purposes of an entitlement to stamps. Nichols v. Hofmann, 188 Vt. 1, 998 A.2d 1040 (2010).

        §
        1321(f) that noncontributing employers reimburse the Department of Employment and Training for any benefits "paid but denied on appeal" does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution.

         6. Personal jurisdiction.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Vermont's relief-from-abuse statute cannot extend the court's personal jurisdiction beyond the bounds of federal due process, as the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment operates as a limitation on the jurisdiction of State courts to enter judgments affecting rights or interests of nonresident defendants. Moreover, the provision stating that the action may be commenced in the county in which the plaintiff resides is fundamentally about venue, not jurisdiction; it does not purport to expand Vermont's jurisdiction over nonresident defendants. Fox v. Fox, 197 Vt. 466, 106 A.3d 919 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        New Hampshire defendant's assault of plaintiff in New Hampshire did not by itself support personal jurisdiction with regard to a final relief-from-abuse order in Vermont because by attacking plaintiff in New Hampshire, defendant did not avail himself of any benefits or protections of Vermont's laws, or subject himself to the authority of Vermont's courts. Furthermore, the fact that defendant took note of plaintiff's Vermont license plate number was not tantamount to stalking plaintiff in Vermont when defendant never physically came to Vermont, contacted plaintiff in Vermont, or contacted anyone else in Vermont in order to threaten or stalk plaintiff. Fox v. Fox, 197 Vt. 466, 106 A.3d 919 (2014).

        On a stigma-plus claim by a former town treasurer against a town, it was error to grant summary judgment to the town, as a factfinder could reasonably conclude that the selectboard failed to grant the treasurer a sufficient opportunity to clear her name. There was no occasion for the treasurer to question the key individuals involved in the allegations or to present her own evidence on the substance of the allegations. Stone v. Town of Irasburg, 196 Vt. 356, 98 A.3d 769 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the purpose of the hearing in a stigma-plus case is not to determine the correctness of the discipline, but to allow an opportunity to clear one's name, an opportunity for formal cross-examination is not always required to satisfy due process. The formality and procedural requirements of the hearing vary depending on the interests at stake; nonetheless, there must be a meaningful opportunity to counter the allegations by argument, and if necessary, by proof, however informal. Stone v. Town of Irasburg, 196 Vt. 356, 98 A.3d 769 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        On a stigma-plus claim, plaintiff was not entitled to a pre-deprivational hearing before receiving a certain letter, as the reputational damage that formed part of the stigma-plus claim did not occur until after receipt and publication of the letter. Stone v. Town of Irasburg, 196 Vt. 356, 98 A.3d 769 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was inadequate good cause for denying defendant his due process right of confrontation at a parole revocation hearing, because the hearsay evidence received by the Parole Board was unreliable. Police reports were not reliable evidence of guilt; police affidavits were lacking a crucial detail; statements by the parolee's mother and sister were oral; and these witnesses refused to testify at the hearing.

        It was the mutual insurance company and its policyholders, not the State, that engaged in the conduct of which dissenting policyholders complained, and therefore claims of dissenting policyholders failed for lack of State action. Cranley v. National Life Insurance Co., 144 F. Supp. 2d 291 (D. Vt. 2001), aff'd, 318 F.3d 105 (2d Cir. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        A "State action" occurs where the challenged action of a private party is "fairly attributable" to the State, that is, when (1) the deprivation is caused by the exercise of some right or privilege created by the State or by a rule of conduct imposed by the State or by a person for whom the State is responsible, and (2) the party charged with the deprivation is a person who may fairly be said to be a State actor. Logan v. Bennington College Corp., 72 F.3d 1017 (2d Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 822, 117 S. Ct. 79, 136 L. Ed. 2d 37 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Characterizing a private party as a "State actor" is a fact-specific inquiry, and courts considering the issue typically look to such factors as the public function of the party's conduct, whether the private party acted under State compulsion, the nexus between the party's conduct and the State, and whether the party's conduct was jointly undertaken with the State. Logan v. Bennington College Corp., 72 F.3d 1017 (2d Cir. 1995), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 822, 117 S. Ct. 79, 136 L. Ed. 2d 37 (1996).

       <p>
        Where college revised its policy to comply with Vermont law, but its action in terminating professor was in no way dictated by State law or State actors, there was an insufficient nexus to warrant a finding of State action.

        For purposes of due process requirements, degree of State involvement in particular limitation of actions statutory provision is sufficient to constitute "State action," where probate court issues letters testamentary or letters of administration after notice by publication and hearing, there is no notice of this action by the court or by the executor or administrator, and the legal proceedings trigger the time bar so that the statute is not self-executing. Martel v. Stafford, 157 Vt. 604, 603 A.2d 345 (1991).

        Plaintiff teacher's substantive due process claim based upon the revocation of her license to teach elementary level students which defendants, Department of Education and its licensing officer had erroneously issued and reissued to her over the course of several years was properly dismissed because the State's withdrawal of her elementary endorsement, and its refusal to grant a waiver outside its normal procedures, did not foreclose altogether her ability to pursue teaching as a profession, and, therefore, she had no liberty interest for which the substantive component of the Due Process Clause might afford her relief.

        The U.S. and State constitutions do not require the State to prove that a mentally ill patient is "a person in need of treatment" in order for the court to revoke order of nonhospitalization, as the "patient in need of further treatment" complies with due process of law. There is no constitutional barrier to using a predictive dangerousness standard where the patient is receiving adequate treatment, required by statute, and the State has evidence of the result of withdrawal of that treatment. Also, the State must have adequate tools to enforce the conditions of its nonhospitalization order, and due process does not deprive the State of the remedy of rehospitalization where appropriate and necessary.

        Plaintiff, whose contract as a school principal was terminated, had not shown a Fourteenth Amendment due process violation based on bias of the school board, in which both administrative and judicial authority were vested. The fact that the board had thought about plaintiff's performance prior to the hearing was not dispositive, so long as it was open to consider the matter based on the evidence; furthermore, as parents had withdrawn an open-meeting lawsuit, plaintiff had not shown a conflict of interest, plaintiff consented to the process that enabled the board chair to testify if he recused himself, and any error in excluding an e-mail was harmless because it simply showed the types of discussion that occurred before termination.

        State employees who have joined a collective bargaining agreement have a vested property interest in their employment, thereby raising due process considerations when they are faced with the possibility of termination of employment. Due process requires a hearing in advance of termination and requires that the hearing be preceded by adequate notice and afford the employee a meaningful opportunity to speak; however, an employer is not required to state that disciplinary action is contemplated, so where a State employee had fair notice that her conduct could result in dismissal and had notice of charges, opportunity to respond, and a subsequent hearing, the requirements of due process were satisfied.

        Noise ordinance was not unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment as applied to appellants, who operated a motocross track on their property, because the noise level here, exceeding 80 dBA, was more than twice as loud as the limit often used, a neighbor described the noise as extremely loud, irritating, assaultive, and disruptive, and the noise occurred for ten to fifteen seconds every five minutes over the course of two hours.

        §
        1201(a), which prohibits a person who is under the influence of intoxicating liquor from being "in actual physical control" of a vehicle, is not vague or uncertain within the strictures of the Due Process Clause of this amendment, since its language is sufficient to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden.

       </p>
       <p>
        Department of Liquor Control General Regulation 17 was not unconstitutionally vague as applied to a licensee. The licensee clearly violated the regulation by allowing an obviously intoxicated person to remain on its premises for 10 minutes, and the licensee's argument that a person engaging in an activity such as dancing was not loitering failed, as the licensee recognized that any person showing signs of intoxication had to be asked to leave, regardless of what activities he or she was engaged in at the time. In re Rusty Nail Acquisition, 186 Vt. 195, 980 A.2d 758 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Instead of using any of the Administrative Procedures Act procedures, or using the Liquor Control Board's training program that was administered to all licensees, to clarify the meaning of a regulation, a licensee waited until it was cited for violating the regulation to challenge its constitutionality. Thus, the court would approach the licensee's vagueness challenge with a critical eye. In re Rusty Nail Acquisition, 186 Vt. 195, 980 A.2d 758 (2009).

        Testimony of a licensee's manager showed that practically speaking, Department of Liquor Control General Regulation 17 showed no confusion over drunken loitering, despite the lack of further definition, but rather prohibited a licensee from allowing an intoxicated person to remain on the licensed premises. Since the licensee's manager articulated the same meaning of the regulation as that expressed by the Liquor Control Board, and fairly appearing in the rule itself, the regulation adequately apprised the licensee of the conduct prohibited. In re Rusty Nail Acquisition, 186 Vt. 195, 980 A.2d 758 (2009).

       <p>
        Department of Liquor Control General Regulation 17 specifically requires that a patron be intoxicated and allowed to remain on the premises before a violation may be found.

        Condition of noticeable intoxication is specific and clearly demonstrable, and is not unreasonably subject to arbitrary interpretation; investigators must see patrons showing signs of alcohol impairment, rather than just tarrying, before they can cite a licensee for violating Department of Liquor Control General Regulation 17, so licensees are not subject to the whims of the investigators. Since the patron must exhibit signs of intoxication before the licensee can be cited for violating the regulation, the licensee remains capable of preventing a violation through diligent oversight, which is exactly what the regulation encourages.

        Even if a mother's due process argument that the father's petition failed to advise her that he would be seeking child support were not precluded, the court would reject it on the merits. Once the Oklahoma trial court's jurisdiction was invoked, the statutes prescribed what issues the trial court would decide; furthermore, the mother clearly had actual notice that child support would be discussed, and owing and being owed child support were sufficiently related such that the lack of notice concerning the potential imposition of child support did not rise to the level of a due process violation.

        Where Roman Catholic Diocese, defending against allegations of childhood sexual abuse occurring 40 years in the past, made no showing that it had no access to records or witnesses, only that it would be burdensome to attempt to locate records or witnesses, this burden did not amount to a violation of due process.

        Trial court properly denied suppression of defendant's statements in the police cruiser and processing room prior to the commencement of formal questioning. While defendant was in custody when she made the statements, and invoked her right to counsel partway through the statements, police at no point did or said anything reasonably likely to elicit incriminating statements, meaning the statements were not the product of custodial interrogation; rather, defendant's statements were not in apparent response to anything police said or did but were part of a self-reflective monologue.

        Instruction did not shift the burden of proof to defendant when in order for the jury to consider an attempt to establish an alibi evidence of guilt, it had to first find beyond a reasonable doubt that the alibi was false or fictitious - that is, the State had to affirmatively disprove the alibi beyond a reasonable doubt. A mere failure to establish an alibi could not be taken as evidence of guilt under this instruction; furthermore, it mentioned nothing about a failed attempt to establish an alibi, but rather addressed a permissible consequence of the State proving that an alibi was false or fictitious.

Thus, a court may not admit statements that were given involuntarily, regardless of whether Miranda warnings were administered or even necessary. State v. Pontbriand, 178 Vt. 120, 878 A.2d 227 (February 18, 2005).

       <p>
        Where the agents did not threaten defendant in any way and made no attempt to pressure him into confessing but instead provided defendant with his Miranda rights, and where he agreed to cooperate and then gave a statement detailing his involvement with cocaine distribution, defendant's statement was fully voluntary. United States v. Zuber, 899 F. Supp. 188 (D. Vt. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Introduction of an involuntary confession into evidence is prohibited by the United States Constitution and the Vermont Constitution; whether a confession is involuntary is determined by examining the totality of the circumstances, the ultimate question being whether police officers' threats, promises, or coercion were sufficient to overcome the defendant's free will or rational intellect, causing the defendant to confess. State v. Gilman, 158 Vt. 210, 608 A.2d 660 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        A trial court's findings in support of its decision to suppress or admit a confession must stand if they are supported by substantial evidence. State v. Gilman, 158 Vt. 210, 608 A.2d 660 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Confession to burglary and assault was not the result of police pressure where defendant arrived at police barracks uninvited and was told he was free to leave; although the officers discussed benefits to him resulting from his becoming a confidential informant, they never promised he would not be prosecuted if he admitted having committed a serious felony unrelated to the subject of their discussion, drug crime. State v. Gilman, 158 Vt. 210, 608 A.2d 660 (1992).

        Where defendant was convicted of both aggravated murder and aggravated sexual assault, his sentence for aggravated sexual assault was impermissible under the Double Jeopardy Clause; serious bodily injury is always proved by proof of death and therefore aggravated sexual assault was a lesser-included offense of aggravated murder, since the lesser offense required no proof beyond that required of the greater offense.

       </p>
       <p>
        Imposition of higher sentence upon retrial by different judge did not violate defendant's due process rights where defendant did not allege actual vindictiveness and nothing in the record suggested that the second judge was motivated by vindictiveness.

        Constitutional touchstone for establishing personal jurisdiction requires that defendant has established certain minimum contacts with forum state before court may assert personal jurisdiction, and determinative factor is foreseeability; defendant's conduct and connection with forum must be such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there. Bechard v. Constanzo, 810 F. Supp. 579 (D. Vt. 1992).
       </p>

        Due process requirements protect an individual who does not have meaningful contacts or ties with a forum state from being subjected to binding judgments in that state. Bechard v. Constanzo, 810 F. Supp. 579 (D. Vt. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        For court to assert in personam jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant, it is not necessary that cause of action being litigated arise out of contacts defendant has with forum state, if defendant has established sufficient contacts with jurisdiction in general; exercise of such general jurisdiction comports with due process when it is based on general business contacts which are continuous and systematic in nature. Bechard v. Constanzo, 810 F. Supp. 579 (D. Vt. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Nonresident surgeon and practice group did not have general business contacts with Vermont sufficient to confer general jurisdiction over them, where they were not licensed in Vermont, did not own property or maintain an office in Vermont, did not advertise or solicit business in Vermont, and only a small number of Vermont residents either occasionally went to Plattsburgh, New York for treatment or became ill while visiting and sought treatment on an emergency basis. Bechard v. Constanzo, 810 F. Supp. 579 (D. Vt. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no authority to support exercise of general personal jurisdiction over nonresident surgeon and practice group in absence of requisite minimum contacts, and argument was rejected that requiring defendants to defend malpractice action in Vermont would be reasonable and comport with fair play and substantial justice, where defendants could not have foreseen that their allegedly unintentional tortious conduct toward plaintiff, then a resident of New York, while treating plaintiff in New York, would have effects in Vermont. Bechard v. Constanzo, 810 F. Supp. 579 (D. Vt. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        A forum state may only invoke personal jurisdiction over a defendant where defendant has certain "minimum contacts" with the forum state such that maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice; requirement of minimum contacts protects defendants from being forced to defend themselves in a distant or inconvenient forum and it acts to ensure that states do not reach out beyond the limits imposed on them as coequal sovereigns in a federal system. Northern Aircraft, Inc. v. Reed, 154 Vt. 36, 572 A.2d 1382 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Before a nonresident defendant can be brought into a Vermont court, the plaintiff must show that the Vermont long arm statute reaches the defendant, and that jurisdiction over him may be maintained without offending the Due Process Clause. Northern Aircraft, Inc. v. Reed, 154 Vt. 36, 572 A.2d 1382 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Once a defendant is found to have purposefully established minimum contacts with the forum state, the court must consider the burden on defendant, the interests of the forum state, the plaintiff 's interest in obtaining relief, the interstate judicial system's interest in efficient conflict resolution, and the shared interest of states in furthering fundamental substantive state policies in order to determine whether the forum state's exercise of personal jurisdiction will offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice under the Due Process Clause. Northern Aircraft, Inc. v. Reed, 154 Vt. 36, 572 A.2d 1382 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the Vermont long arm statute reflects a clear policy to assert jurisdiction over individuals to the full extent permitted by the Due Process Clause, issue of whether Vermont court may exercise personal jurisdiction over nonresident defendants must be resolved under federal constitutional law. Northern Aircraft, Inc. v. Reed, 154 Vt. 36, 572 A.2d 1382 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The critical consideration in determining whether a forum may invoke personal jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant is not merely whether being summoned into the forum was foreseeable, but whether the defendant's conduct and connection with the forum state are such that he should reasonably anticipate being hauled into court there; thus, a defendant cannot be summoned into a jurisdiction merely as a result of fortuitous, attenuated, or random contacts but only where he purposefully directs his activities toward residents of the forum and the litigation arises out of those activities.

        In school disciplinary cases, the underlying question should be whether the student's interests have been properly protected, so that he was not prejudiced by the failure to give written notice, per se, or by any failure of strict and literal compliance by school authorities with their own regulations; if that question can be answered in the affirmative, there has been no necessary violation of the Due Process Clause.

        Pretrial identification was not suggestive. The lineup at issue consisted of eight photographs, all of men with round faces, stocky builds, fair complexions, light hair, and in their late twenties to early forties; an officer handed each of the eight photos to the victim sequentially, telling him that he should examine them and choose his assailant; the victim was told that the officer could not answer any questions during the process; and the victim examined the photos and selected two who resembled the person who had assaulted him.

        Defendant's argument that the State's use of a witness's testimony violated his due process rights because it was knowingly false depended entirely on the fact that the witness's deposition testimony differed from his earlier sworn statement. That fact, however, did not support his claim of error. State v. Davis, 187 Vt. 594, 992 A.2d 302 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        State did not ask the jury to believe the "false" portions of a witness's testimony; instead, it attempted to impeach the witness with his prior sworn statement so as to discredit the statements that went against the State's theory of the case. As the State did not attempt to mislead the jury through the presentation of the witness's false testimony, there was no due process violation. State v. Davis, 187 Vt. 594, 992 A.2d 302 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Claim that a prosecutor has knowingly relied upon false testimony must be distinguished from the use of a witness who has made prior inconsistent statements under oath, particularly where the defendant is aware of those statements. Thus, it was not a due process violation for the State to put a witness on the stand, despite the fact that he gave testimony at his deposition that differed in part from his prior sworn statement; defendant's argument that the State had every reason to believe that the witness would testify consistent with his deposition and contrary to his initial statement to the police was unavailing and did not convert anticipation into legal knowledge.

        When no fundamental right or suspect class is involved, the test for validity of statutes under both the Common Benefits Clause of the Vermont Constitution and the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution is whether the law is reasonably related to the promotion of a valid public purpose. Lorrain v. Ryan, 160 Vt. 202, 628 A.2d 543 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Computation of good-time credit applicable to reduce criminal sentences did not implicate fundamental rights; therefore, upon equal protection challenge, discriminatory statutory classification based on length of time served was reviewable on rational-basis test. Venman v. Patrissi, 156 Vt. 257, 590 A.2d 897 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Equal protection guarantee under Vermont Constitution is similar to Equal Protection Clause of this amendment; as such, unless a fundamental right or suspect class is involved, a statute comports with the constitutional guarantees if it is reasonably related to a legitimate public purpose. State v. George, 157 Vt. 580, 602 A.2d 953 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where legislation's alleged discrimination is based on gender, courts scrutinize the legislative classification by the higher standard of whether it is "substantially related" to an important and legitimate State interest. State v. George, 157 Vt. 580, 602 A.2d 953 (1991).
       </p>

       </p>
       <p>
        Distinctions reviewed under the rational basis test will be found unconstitutional only if similar persons are treated differently on wholly arbitrary and capricious grounds; if there is a rational basis for the distinctions, serving a legitimate policy objective, there is no equal protection violation. Smith v. Town of St. Johnsbury, 150 Vt. 351, 554 A.2d 233 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the strict scrutiny test, any classification that serves to penalize the exercise of a fundamental right, unless shown to be necessary to promote a compelling governmental interest, is unconstitutional. Leverson v. Conway, 144 Vt. 523, 481 A.2d 1029 (1984), appeal dismissed, 469 U.S. 926, 105 S. Ct. 316, 83 L. Ed. 2d 255 (1984), vacated and remanded, 472 U.S. 1014, 105 S. Ct. 3471, 87 L. Ed. 2d 608 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The strict scrutiny test is invoked upon a showing of some penalty resulting from the exercise of a fundamental right, such as the right to travel; there is no requirement of a showing that a person was deterred from traveling, only that there was a penalty for doing so. Leverson v. Conway, 144 Vt. 523, 481 A.2d 1029 (1984), appeal dismissed, 469 U.S. 926, 105 S. Ct. 316, 83 L. Ed. 2d 255 (1984), vacated and remanded, 472 U.S. 1014, 105 S. Ct. 3471, 87 L.

       </p>
       <p>
        Absent a showing of either a suspect classification or an infringement upon a fundamental constitutional right, a statute will not violate the Equal Protection Clause of this amendment as long as it bears a rational relationship to a legitimate governmental interest. Riddel v. Department of Employment Security, 140 Vt. 82, 436 A.2d 1086 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether economic regulation is violative of the Equal Protection Clause of this amendment, the Supreme Court is required to impose only the minimum scrutiny of the "rational basis test," which permits a determination of unconstitutionality only where the relevant law classifies similar persons for different treatment upon wholly arbitrary and capricious grounds, and where the classification rests upon some reasonable consideration of legislative policy it will not be found unconstitutional. Hadwen, Inc. v. Department of Taxes, 139 Vt. 37, 422 A.2d 255 (1980), appeal dismissed, 451 U.S. 977, 101 S. Ct. 2300, 68 L. Ed. 2d 834 (1981).

        Town's decision to change zoning classification of .82 acre parcel of land from "rural residential" to "roadside commercial" did not constitute impermissible spot zoning; town contained little land suitable for development and there were other commercial uses in immediate vicinity, there was a discernible benefit to the community, and change in classification did not significantly conflict with town plan.

        Sole fact that a party moves to strike the only minority juror from the venire is insufficient, by itself, to establish a prima facie case of discriminatory motive.

        Defendant was entitled to a new trial when the trial court prevented his counsel from using a peremptory challenge to strike the only black member of the jury pool. The trial court relied on nothing else than the fact that there was a peremptory challenge to the single black juror to support its suspicion of discrimination; absent from the instant case was anything additionally noted by the trial court, such as counsel's tone, demeanor, pattern, past conduct, or other surrounding circumstance, suggestive of a discriminatory motivation behind the peremptory challenge. State v. Bol, 190 Vt. 313, 29 A.3d 1249 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's prima facie determination of discrimination rested on nothing other than defense counsel's proposed strike of the sole black juror from the venire, without any other reason, stated or apparent, for its insistence on a race-neutral explanation for the peremptory challenge. Thus, its decision was reviewed de novo. State v. Bol, 190 Vt. 313, 29 A.3d 1249 (2011).

        Motor vehicle purchase and use tax imposed under 32 V.S.A.
        §
        8903 does not violate the Equal Protection Clause of this amendment by its failure to afford a new resident who registers a vehicle in Vermont credit for a sales tax paid on the vehicle, which was purchased, used and registered in a former state of residence, since the exempt classification established by 32 V.S.A.

         §
        </span>
        8911 is rationally related to the legitimate purpose of promoting commerce within the State and raising taxes to help maintain and improve the State and interstate highway system, and it is not an arbitrary one because a new resident who registers his vehicle pays the same tax and is treated in exactly the same manner as all nonexempt persons. Leverson v. Conway, 144 Vt. 523, 41 A.2d 1029 (1984), appeal dismissed, 469 U.S. 926, 105 S. Ct. 316, 83 L. Ed. 2d 255 (1984), vacated and remanded, 472 U.S. 1014, 105 S. Ct. 3471, 87 L.

        For purposes of the exemption from use tax for sales of newspapers, the distinction between newspapers and other periodicals is neither arbitrary nor capricious because the State has a legitimate interest in encouraging the inexpensive and wide dissemination of newspapers in order for its citizens to be informed of current affairs, and in removing the collection burden where the tax amounts are de minimus. In re Picket Fence Review, 173 Vt. 369, 795 A.2d 1242 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Two fundamental requirements exist for valid imposition of taxes in Vermont: first, any legislative classification of taxpayers must bear a reasonable relation to the purpose for which it is established; and second, the classification scheme must be fairly and equitably applied among like classes of taxpayers. Burlington Electric Dept. v. Vermont Department of Taxes, 154 Vt. 332, 576 A.2d 450 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether a legislative classification of taxpayers violates the Vermont and U.S. Constitutions, the Supreme Court does not compare legislative purposes, but rather looks for a reasonable relationship between the classification and its purposes. Burlington Electric Dept. v. Vermont Department of Taxes, 154 Vt. 332, 576 A.2d 450 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Taxing wood chips burned to produce electricity at an electric generating plant, in addition to taxing the plant's use of electricity it generated, did not amount to impermissible double taxation, since two taxes were imposed in two separate transactions: (1) a tax on the purchase of tangible personal property, wood chips; and (2) a tax on the use of tangible personal property, electricity. Burlington Electric Dept. v. Vermont Department of Taxes, 154 Vt. 332, 576 A.2d 450 (1990).

        Presence of exceptions in unemployment compensation statute concerning qualification as employer did not render statute void, and owner of dental clinic assessed for unpaid contributions under the statute was not thereby denied equal protection of the laws; statute would violate equal protection only where exceptions were so pervasive as to render entire act irrational.

        Residency requirement of 32 V.S.A.
        §
        5922, providing tax credits for renewable energy systems installed in private residences, which extended the credit only to taxpayers who resided in the State for the entire calendar year in which the system was installed, violated the Equal Protection Clause of this amendment. Bagley v. Vermont Department of Taxes, 146 Vt. 120, 500 A.2d 223 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any classification of taxation is permissible which rationally furthers a legitimate State purpose. Leverson v. Conway, 144 Vt. 523, 481 A.2d 1029 (1984), appeal dismissed, 469 U.S. 926, 105 S. Ct. 316, 83 L. Ed. 2d 255 (1984), vacated and remanded, 472 U.S. 1014, 105 S. Ct. 3471, 87 L. Ed. 2d 608 (1985).

        In an action challenging a municipal tax scheme on the basis of the Equal Protection Clause of this amendment, once a classification has been shown to exist, and its effect on the complaining party made clear, the municipality must then justify that classification. Colchester Fire District No. 2 v. Sharrow, 145 Vt. 195, 485 A.2d 134 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Equal Protection Clause of this amendment does not require identity of treatment with respect to classification for property tax purposes, but only that the classification or distinction rest upon real, unfeigned difference, have some relevance to the legislative purposes, and lead to a difference in treatment that is not so disparate as to be wholly arbitrary. Vermont Motor Inns, Inc. v. Town of Hartford, 134 Vt. 52, 350 A.2d 369 (1975); Town of Cambridge v. Bassett, 142 Vt. 171, 453 A.2d 413 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the State may not make a palpably arbitrary classification for purposes of taxation, any plan is valid under the Equal Protection Clause of this amendment, provided it rests upon some ground or difference having a fair and substantial relation to the object of legislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike. Town of Hartland v. Damon's Estate, 103 Vt. 519, 156 A. 518 (1931).
       </p>
       <p>
        Equality Clause of this amendment does not prohibit classification of property by State for purposes of taxation, so long as classification rests upon some ground of difference having a fair and reasonable relation to subject of legislation, so that all persons similarly situated are treated alike. Village of Hardwick v. Town of Wolcott, 98 Vt. 343, 129 A. 159 (1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Equal Protection Clause of this amendment does not prevent a classification of property for the purpose of taxation, but it requires that the classification be based on some distinction that bears a just relation to the purpose of the enactment. State v. Clement National Bank, 84 Vt. 167, 78 A. 944 (1911), affirmed, 231 U.S. 120, 34 S. Ct. 31, 58 L. Ed. 147 (1913).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the Equality Clause of this amendment does not prohibit classification for the purposes of taxation, it does require that the classification should be founded upon some reasonable basis; and such a basis is not found in the fact that goods are manufactured in different states. State v. Hoyt, 71 Vt. 59, 42 A. 973 (1899).

        The Vermont and U.S. Constitutions impose no rule of equality of taxation, for reasonable schemes of taxation must have flexibility and variety; as a result, some discriminatory impact is virtually inevitable.

       </p>
       <p>
        Imposition of sales and use tax on wood chips burned to produce electricity at an electric generating plant did not unfairly discriminate against manufacturers who burned their raw materials, since the sales and use tax focused on retail sales, and manufacturers who burned wood chips represented the ultimate users of wood chips as fuel. Burlington Electric Dept. v. Vermont Department of Taxes, 154 Vt. 332, 576 A.2d 450 (1990).

       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that fair market value of plaintiff utility company's property was established by methods other than review of sales of comparable properties does not make equalization ratio inapplicable; where equalization ratios are applied to property assessed at fair market value, constitutional considerations of equal protection and proportional contribution require that they be applied to all property so valued.

       </p>
       <p>
        With respect to reapportionment of State Senate, the key demand of the Equal Protection Clause is representation on a balanced population basis, and other considerations, such as giving each county as presently established at least one Senator and maintaining the integrity of counties as senatorial districts, must yield. In re Senate Bills 177 & 83, 132 Vt. 282, 318 A.2d 157 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plan reapportioning State Senate did not violate equal protection because one county had six Senators, due to its high population, and the other counties had from one to three Senators. In re Senate Bills 177 & 83, 132 Vt. 282, 318 A.2d 157 (1974).

       <p>
        Redistricting of State Senate along county lines on basis of total residents with multimember districts and redistricting of House of Representatives along town lines on basis of registered voters with multimember districts is valid under the Equal Protection Clause of this amendment.
