       The Department of Corrections created by <cite class="vt-code">3 V.S.A. § 3081</cite> shall have the purpose of developing and administering a correctional program designed to protect persons and property against offenders of the criminal law and to render treatment to offenders with the goal of achieving their successful return and participation as citizens of the State and community, to foster their human dignity and to preserve the human resources of the community.
      </li>
      <li id="t28c01s01ol1b">
       The Department shall formulate its programs and policies recognizing that almost all criminal offenders ultimately return to the community, and that the traditional institutional prisons fail to reform or rehabilitate, operating instead to increase the risk of continued criminal acts following release. The Department shall develop and implement a comprehensive program that will provide necessary closed custodial confinement of frequent, dangerous offenders, but that also will establish as its primary objective the disciplined preparation of offenders for their responsible roles in the open community. The Department shall ensure that the comprehensive program required by this subsection includes a process by which each offender sentenced to any term of imprisonment other than for life without parole, within 30 days after receiving his or her sentence, shall begin to develop and implement a plan preparing for return to the community.
      </li>
      <li id="t28c01s01ol1c">
       In order to implement its programs and policies the Department shall develop and maintain correctional facilities that shall include both residence-centered institutions and facilities reflecting nonresidence principles designed to facilitate the reintegration of the offender into the community.
    These facilities shall utilize the supporting resources of probation and parole services, the increased cooperation of personnel in the fields of welfare, health, and education, and the increased participation of the citizens of the State in attempts to achieve correctional purposes and objectives.

       State policy.
    
    It is the policy of this State that principles of restorative justice be included in shaping how the criminal justice system responds to persons charged with or convicted of criminal offenses, and how the State responds to persons who are in contempt of child support orders. The policy goal is a community response to a person's wrongdoing at its earliest onset, and a type and intensity of sanction tailored to each instance of wrongdoing. Policy objectives are to:
       <ol>
        <li id="t28c01s2aol1a1">
         Resolve conflicts and disputes by means of a nonadversarial community process.
        </li>
        <li id="t28c01s2aol1a2">
         Repair damage caused by criminal acts to communities in which they occur, and to address wrongs inflicted on individual victims.
        </li>
        <li id="t28c01s2aol1a3">
         Reduce the risk of an offender committing a more serious crime in the future, that would require a more intensive and more costly sanction, such as incarceration.

     Implementation.
    </b>
    It is the intent of the General Assembly that law enforcement officials develop and employ restorative justice approaches whenever feasible and responsive to specific criminal acts, pursuant to <cite class="vt-code">3 V.S.A. §§ 163</cite> and 164, concerning court diversion; 13 V.S.A. chapter 221, concerning sentencing; and the provisions of this title, concerning persons in the custody of the Commissioner of Corrections. It is the further intent of the General Assembly that such restorative justice programs be designed to encourage participation by local community members, including victims, when they so choose, as well as public officials, in holding offenders accountable for damage caused to communities and victims, and in restoring offenders to the law-abiding community, through activities:
       <ol>
        <li id="t28c01s2aol1b1">
         That require offenders to:
         <ol type="A">
          <li id="t28c01s2aol1b1A">
           acknowledge wrongdoing and apologize to victims;
          </li>
          <li id="t28c01s2aol1b1B">
           make restitution for damage to the victims, consistent with provisions of 13 V.S.A. chapter 221 and of this title;
          </li>
          <li id="t28c01s2aol1b1C">
           make reparation for damage to the community by fulfilling a community service; and
          </li>
          <li id="t28c01s2aol1b1D">
           when relevant, successfully complete treatment addressing the offense or other underlying problematic behavior, or undertake academic or vocational training or other self-improving activity.

        </li>
        <li id="t28c01s2aol1b2">
         That aid in the recovery of victims, recognizing that victims, particularly of violent crime, often suffer lifelong effects and, accordingly, must feel safe and involved in any program offered to assist them.
        </li>
        <li id="t28c01s2aol1b3">

        Statutes setting forth purposes of Department of Corrections and responsibilities of Commissioner did not compel conclusion that Vermont furlough statute required individual furlough assessments for each inmate prior to inmate's minimum release date.

       </p>

        Commissioner of Department of Corrections acted within authority conferred upon him by Legislature in promulgating policy which would make prisoners convicted of violent felonies ineligible for furlough until expiration of their minimum sentences.

       <p>
        Authority to enter into contract to transfer Vermont inmates to an out-of-state facility was well within the powers reasonably and necessarily implied by the fundamental obligation of the Commissioner of the Department of Corrections to maintain prison safety and order, and the Commissioner's express and unfettered statutory authority to designate, assign and transfer inmates.

       <p>
        The Legislature's grant of power to contract with private collection agencies for the collection of court-ordered fines does not prevent a trial court from ordering a different means of collection when individual circumstances merit it in the probation context. State v. Powers, 173 Vt. 550, 789 A.2d 962 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Legislature's grant of power to contract with private collection agencies for the collection of court-ordered fines does not preclude the Department and the Commissioner from carrying out their responsibility "[t]o administer the supervision of persons placed on probation," and "maintain general supervision of persons placed on probation... consistent with any orders of the court," even when those court orders specify a means of payment of a fine that would prevent it from being contracted out to a collection agency.

         4. Inmate treatment programs.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Establishment of programming requirements falls within the Commissioner of Corrections' explicit power to establish inmate treatment programs. The Department of Corrections is not an inferior court or tribunal of the Superior Court of Vermont, nor is it performing the functions of a quasi-judicial body when it establishes programming requirements; rather, the Commissioner is fulfilling his statutorily created responsibilities to establish classification and commitment programs for each inmate in a correctional facility and to periodically review such programming decisions. Rheaume v. Pallito, 190 Vt. 245, 30 A.3d 1263 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the decision to designate a sex offender as highly dangerous could be termed a quasi-judicial act - likely the reason why the Legislature explicitly provided for judicial review of designation decisions - the promulgation of programming requirements falls within the broad discretion of the Department of Corrections to determine what mode of treatment best serves individual inmates. Broad discretion must be granted to correctional authorities to determine what mode of treatment will best serve the individual inmate, and nothing in the statutes limits that discretion. Rheaume v. Pallito, 190 Vt. 245, 30 A.3d 1263 (2011).

      Whenever used in this chapter, unless a different meaning plainly is required, "probation" means a procedure under which a respondent, found guilty of a crime upon verdict or plea, is released by the court, without confinement, subject to conditions imposed by the court and subject to the supervision of the Commissioner.

         1. Restitution.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        On its face, the restitution statute simply is not applicable to situations where no crime has occurred. It is universally acknowledged that a probation revocation proceeding is not essentially "criminal" in nature, and other courts have made a similar distinction between a probation violation and the underlying crime; it follows, therefore, that a probation violation is not a separate crime sufficient to independently trigger the restitution statute. State v. Bohannon, 187 Vt. 410, 996 A.2d 196 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Expenses for which restitution was being sought were not the direct result of the crime for which defendant was convicted and sentenced; instead, the expenses associated with extradition were directly related to the separate probation violation of leaving the state of Vermont without permission or notice to defendant's parole officer and taking up residence in the state of Washington. Thus, they could not be made the subject of a restitution order. State v. Bohannon, 187 Vt. 410, 996 A.2d 196 (2010).

         2. Effect of violation.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        There is an obvious connection between a suspended sentence imposed for an underlying crime and the reimposed sentence following a defendant's violation of probation conditions. The reinstatement of an original sentence following a probation violation, however, does not transform a probation violation and an underlying criminal offense into the same act. State v. Bohannon, 187 Vt. 410, 996 A.2d 196 (2010).

       <p>
        A defendant seeking access to another individual's presentence investigation report (PSI) must support the request with a plausible showing of materiality; upon such a showing, the court should review the PSI in camera and disclose only that information, if any, that is material to guilt or punishment. State v. Bacon, 167 Vt. 88, 702 A.2d 116 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant did not make a plausible showing that information in other individual's presentence investigation reports (PSIs) was material to his sentencing: He did not claim that the requested PSIs contained information concerning his culpability or aggravating and mitigating factors, but sought only to compare himself with other individuals who had been sentenced to life-without-parole. Even if it was assumed that the PSIs would have shown that these other individuals were more culpable and dangerous than defendant, that information would not have been material to his sentence, as sentencing in Vermont is individualized, with broad discretion afforded the trial court in fashioning an appropriate sentence, which may involve a wide-ranging inquiry into a defendant's life and the nature of the offense committed. State v. Bacon, 167 Vt. 88, 702 A.2d 116 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant requested access to the presentence investigation report (PSI) of his accomplice, the court should have reviewed the accomplice's PSI in camera and disclosed any information material to defendant's sentence, such as motives or relative responsibility for the crime. State v. Bacon, 167 Vt. 88, 702 A.2d 116 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Policy of this section and V.R.Cr.P. 32 is that presentence investigation reports be available for inspection, in trial court's discretion, when availability is in the best interests of defendant. In re Sevene, 136 Vt. 602, 396 A.2d 1390 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to produce presentence investigation report at request of person who had pled guilty to statutory rape and been sentenced, and who, in petition for review of sentence, stated that he was functionally illiterate and that his presentence report was not read to him until weeks after sentence, was not sound exercise of court's discretion to make report available, and dismissal of petition had to be vacated where court had not considered the report, yet found that petitioner failed to substantiate claim that inaccuracies in it were grounds for vacating plea and sentence. In re Sevene, 136 Vt. 602, 396 A.2d 1390 (1979).

       <p>
        The qualified First Amendment right of access that attaches to documents submitted by parties in sentencing hearings does not extend to presentence investigation reports (PSI) prepared at the request of, and for the benefit of, the sentencing court, which are protected by 28 V.S.A.
        §
        204(d) and have historically not been open to the press and public. This conclusion is not affected by the fact that some information contained in a PSI may become public during the sentencing process, as the documents themselves have been, and continue to be, treated as confidential. Much information contained in PSIs, including that provided by defendants themselves, remains private. State v. LaBounty, 167 Vt. 25, 702 A.2d 82 (1997).

        Subsection (e) of this section, granting an absolute right to a victim to submit comments or a written statement for inclusion in the presentence report, does not imply the prohibition of any other manner of victim participation in sentencing.

        Age-related impairment in a person's ability to, for example, manage his or her own finances does not foreclose the possibility that the person may still be capable of expressing himself or herself regarding a matter upon which he or she is called to testify. Thus, a person may be found to be a "vulnerable adult" and the victim of a charge of exploiting a vulnerable adult, but still be competent to testify according to the Vermont Rules of Evidence and for the purposes of sentencing consideration. State v. Davis, 207 Vt. 346, 186 A.3d 1088 (Mar. 23, 2018).

       <p>
        With regard to defendant's Ex Post Facto Clause claim, designating defendant "high risk" was for the sole purpose of increasing public access to his status as a sex offender and related information. Although the trial court held that the statute prohibiting early release until 70 percent of the defendant's maximum sentence was completed violated the Ex Post Facto Clause, that statute had no legal effect on the length of defendant's incarceration. Defendant could point to no statute or administrative directive that retroactively removed or limited the Vermont Department of Corrections' discretion over his treatment programming and that consequently resulted in a longer period of incarceration. Chandler v. Pallito, 203 Vt. 482, 158 A.3d 296 (Sept. 23, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court does not find the 70 percent rule, in cases where it applies, to constitute a usurpation of judicial power. State v. Goewey, 201 Vt. 37, 135 A.3d 1220 (2015).

         2. Applicability.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Seventy percent rule does not apply in cases where the length of the maximum sentence is imprisonment for life, because 70 percent of that time is not capable of determination. State v. Goewey, 201 Vt. 37, 135 A.3d 1220 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        In creating the 70 percent rule, the Legislature obviously intended it to apply to fixed-period maximum sentences, that is, those which are measured by a term of years. State v. Goewey, 201 Vt. 37, 135 A.3d 1220 (2015).

        The language of 28 V.S.A.
        §
        304(a), when read together with subsection (a) of this section, did not impliedly give the option to the sentencing court to suspend part of the underlying sentence upon finding a violation of parole. State v. Pratt, 173 Vt. 562, 795 A.2d 1148 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        The phrase "in accordance with law," as used in this section, was intended to bind sentencing courts to comply with section 252 of this title, governing conditions of probation, not to limit the period of probation which a court may impose. Sherwin v. Hogan, 136 Vt. 606, 401 A.2d 895 (1979).

        Consecutive sentences are to be aggregated before partial or total suspension of any of the sentences is taken into account; after the sentences are aggregated, the fact that some of the sentences may be partially or completely suspended is considered to compute the manner in which a defendant will serve the aggregated sentences.

        Appellate court found it was the best interpretation of the interface between U.S. Sentencing Guidelines Manual
        §
        4A1.2(c)(1)(A) and 28 V.S.A.
        <span class="s1">
         §
        </span>
        205 that the duration of an indefinite sentence of probation for purposes of Guidelines
        <span class="s1">
         §
        </span>
        4A1.2(c)(1)(A) was the duration of the period for which the sentencing court continued the probation in effect.
    Under this view, an indefinite term of probation was a term of probation of at least one year if the sentencing court continued the probation for at least one year. United States v. Tomasi, 313 F.3d 653 (2d Cir. 2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        When read as consistent with order from bench, court's written order imposed an indeterminate probation period from which defendant was not to be discharged "until further order of court"; in this form, probation condition was explicitly authorized by subsection (a) of this section. State v. Lloyd, 169 Vt. 643, 740 A.2d 364 (mem.) (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        If no period is specified, probation may last longer than a defendant's original sentence. State v. Bensh, 168 Vt. 607, 719 A.2d 1155 (mem.) (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Parole board's decision to place defendant on parole had no effect on his sentence, and defendant's completion of parole had no bearing on his status as a probationer because he had not yet been released from probation; defendant therefore remained bound by probation agreement, and his probation was properly revoked for violation of its terms. State v. Bensh, 168 Vt. 607, 719 A.2d 1155 (mem.) (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prisoner who could have been imprisoned for up to one year would not, upon being imprisoned for breach of probation conditions, be released on the ground that he could not validly be placed on probation for a period exceeding the maximum possible prison term.

     <p>
      The court placing a person on probation may terminate the period of probation and discharge the person at any time if such termination is warranted by the conduct of the offender and the ends of justice.
     </p>
     <p>
      (b) (1)
    Upon the Commissioner's motion to discharge pursuant to subsection 252(d) of this title, the sentencing court shall terminate the period of probation and discharge the person at the midpoint of the probation term unless the prosecutor seeks a continuation of probation within 21 days of receipt of notice of the Commissioner's motion; and
     </p>
     <ol type="A">
      <li id="t28c05sub02s251ol1A">
       the court finds by a preponderance of the evidence that termination and discharge will present a risk of danger to the victim of the offense or to the community; or
      </li>
      <li id="t28c05sub02s251ol1B">
       the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that the probationer is not substantially in compliance with the conditions of probation that are related to the probationer's rehabilitation or to victim or community safety.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      (2) If the court grants the prosecutor's motion to continue probation, it may continue probation for the full term or any portion thereof. The court shall also review the conditions of probation and remove any conditions that are no longer necessary for the remainder of the term.
     </p>
     <p>
      (c)
    A probationer shall not be deemed ineligible for discharge or term reduction due to unpaid restitution, fees, or surcharges.

         2. Consecutive sentence.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        When a prisoner on probation is convicted of a subsequent offense, criterion imposed by section 7032 of Title 13, governing imposition of consecutive sentences, that a subsequent conviction must occur before the defendant has been discharged from a prior sentence, must be read with reference to this section and section 255 of this title, governing discharge from probation; together, they permit a subsequent court, in its discretion, to impose a sentence consecutive to probation. In re Hough, 143 Vt. 15, 458 A.2d 1134 (1983).

       <p>
        Without provision of notice to defendant of her violation of probation during its term, court was without authority to extend defendant's probation after it had expired. State v. Murray, 159 Vt. 198, 617 A.2d 135 (1992).

       <p>
        If no period is specified, probation may last longer than a defendant's original sentence. State v. Bensh, 168 Vt. 607, 719 A.2d 1155 (mem.) (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Parole board's decision to place defendant on parole had no effect on his sentence, and defendant's completion of parole had no bearing on his status as a probationer because he had not yet been released from probation; defendant therefore remained bound by probation agreement, and his probation was properly revoked for violation of its terms. State v. Bensh, 168 Vt. 607, 719 A.2d 1155 (mem.) (1998).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Probationer is entitled to a hearing on disputed material facts before the trial court can order a less-than-satisfactory discharge from probation. State v. Nolen, 193 Vt. 116, 71 A.3d 1213 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Actions by the trial court affecting defendant's probationary status and freedom, such as a revocation of probation, require a hearing on the merits. Attaching the label of "unsatisfactory" to a defendant's discharge from probation constitutes a legally adverse action by the trial court which requires the State to prove unsatisfactory performance and entitles the defendant to respond to the State's allegations. State v. Nolen, 193 Vt. 116, 71 A.3d 1213 (2012).

         6. Unsatisfactory discharge.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Absent a stipulation between the parties, the trial court abused its discretion by issuing an adverse order of unsatisfactory discharge with neither findings on the underlying basis for its determination nor an opportunity for defendant to be heard on the facts in dispute. State v. Nolen, 193 Vt. 116, 71 A.3d 1213 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the trial court erred in ordering without a hearing that defendant receive an unsatisfactory discharge from probation, the court declined to order a satisfactory discharge from probation. Whether defendant was entitled to a satisfactory discharge, and on what grounds, could be considered by the trial court on remand. State v. Nolen, 193 Vt. 116, 71 A.3d 1213 (2012).

         7. Early termination.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court properly held that it lacked the authority to terminate defendant's probation obligations and expunge his criminal convictions halfway through his stipulated deferred-sentence term, as the term of deferment could not be shortened without the State's consent, and allowing defendant to escape the agreement's burden after he had benefited from it would not advance the ends of justice.

       <p>
        The Legislature placed the power to impose probation conditions on the court, and not on the corrections department and its employees; similarly, the power to modify probation conditions also rests exclusively with the courts. State v. Rivers, 178 Vt. 180, 878 A.2d 1070 (June 10, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        A probation condition is valid if the conduct it requires is not itself criminal and is reasonably related to the crime of which the defendant was convicted. State v. Peck, 149 Vt. 617, 547 A.2d 1329 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Probation conditions are statutorily authorized and constitutionally permissible if they are reasonably related to the crime for which defendant was convicted and to the purposes of sentencing, including the goal of rehabilitation, and if they are not unduly restrictive of the probationer's liberty or autonomy. State v. Whitchurch, 155 Vt. 134, 577 A.2d 690 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Due process requires that a defendant receive fair notice as to what acts may constitute a violation of his probation; in addition to the statutorily mandated certificate setting forth the conditions of release, the instructions and directions given by the probation officer can serve to provide fair notice. State v. Gleason, 154 Vt. 205, 576 A.2d 1246 (1990).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Although the probation conditions imposed might be "standard" in the sense that they appeared in an internal judiciary probation order template, as well as a standard plea agreement form generated by the Court Administrator, the inclusion of these particular conditions on a form labeled "standard conditions" did not reflect a judicial determination that every condition included was presumptively valid, or that the whole package of conditions could be applied in every case; nor did this reflect a judicial determination that all of the conditions were constitutional and valid on their face and provided adequate notice of what conduct might lead to a revocation of probation. The only truly "standard" condition was the one providing that the court could revoke probation if the offender was convicted of another offense while the sentence was still subject to revocation. State v. Putnam, 200 Vt. 257, 130 A.3d 836 (Sept. 4, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        A trial court's decision to suspend criminal sentence and impose conditions of probation, under statute, represents an essential tool in court's ability to shape a criminal sentence to rehabilitative needs of individual defendant. State v. Nelson, 170 Vt. 125, 742 A.2d 1248 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Purpose of probation is to provide the opportunity for a defendant to voluntarily condition his behavior according to the requirements of the law and test his ability to do so, and as such it is prospective, based on a promise of future conduct. State v. Hale, 137 Vt. 162, 400 A.2d 996 (1979).

         4. Violation of conditions.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Requirement that a defendant be provided with a certificate explicitly setting forth the conditions upon which he or she is being released on probation is not satisfied by a plea agreement, because the conditions of release are ultimately still set by the court at sentencing, and not by the prosecutor during plea negotiations; the conditions of release thus do not necessarily reflect all the prosecutor seeks. The terms of the plea agreement, therefore, may not be used alone to prove a violation of probation; only a signed probation order may be so used. State v. Hemingway, 196 Vt. 441, 97 A.3d 465 (May 9, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Retraction of probation, to be consistent with the objectives of its statutory justification, should be reserved for behavior that breaches its conditions after the probationary agreement is entered into, and to arbitrarily withdraw probation without any violative act on the person's part is to reduce the state's performance to something close to capricious, and a departure from the statutory objectives. State v. Hale, 137 Vt. 162, 400 A.2d 996 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Revocation of probation for an act or failure to act contrary to a condition of probation must be based on an act or failure to act occurring after conditions of probation are agreed to. State v. Hale, 137 Vt. 162, 400 A.2d 996 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant on probation under condition that he not be convicted of another offense was convicted of an offense which occurred prior to his being placed on probation for the first offense, he could not be charged with violating the terms of probation and his probation could not be revoked. State v. Hale, 137 Vt. 162, 400 A.2d 996 (1979).

       <p>
        Probation condition that prohibited defendant from engaging in criminal behavior, which was imposed after a jury convicted him of unlawful trespass, was reasonably necessary to ensure that defendant would live a law-abiding life and was well within the trial court's statutory discretion to impose; furthermore, the condition did not reach lawful behavior and was neither vague nor unclear, and it did not give probation officers untethered discretion in that courts retained the power to revoke probation if the statutory requirements were met. State v. Richards, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (May 28, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Probation condition that defendant avoid pornography was improper when there was no evidence that pornography was related to his offense, his individual history, or his behaviors or that the condition was generally necessary for the rehabilitation of all sex offenders; the fact that the pornography condition was part of the sex-offender treatment program defendant was otherwise required to complete was not sufficient to support the condition. State v. Bouchard, 211 Vt. 454, 228 A.3d 349 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because a probation condition imposed upon defendant, a sex offender, on its face authorized limitless monitoring of his computer and internet use, it was not narrowly tailored to ensure a permissible balance between the government's interests and defendant's privacy rights, and was not reasonably necessary to help defendant lead a law-abiding life. State v. Bouchard, 211 Vt. 454, 228 A.3d 349 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Probation condition regarding pornography, erotica, and sexual establishments was not supported by the evidence. The record did not show that the crime - sexual assault of an adult - was connected to pornography, erotica, adult bookstores, sex shops, topless bars, or other similar establishments, nor did the State present evidence that defendant's individual history or behaviors supported the condition as part of his rehabilitation or for the protection of the public. State v. Lumumba, 207 Vt. 254, 187 A.3d 353 (Apr. 6, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant failed to show why a probation condition completely prohibiting his alcohol possession or use was unreasonable under the circumstances. The trial court was concerned about the nature of the offense, a public brawl where defendant committed an aggravated assault while drunk and armed with a knife, and felt total abstinence from alcohol was warranted to aid in defendant's rehabilitation. State v. Urban, 207 Vt. 13, 184 A.3d 731 (Feb. 23, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because a condition that defendant not buy, have or use any regulated drugs unless prescribed precluded conduct that was criminal, the trial court was not required to find a reasonable relationship between defendant's conviction and the condition. State v. Putnam, 200 Vt. 257, 130 A.3d 836 (Sept. 4, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because defendant's conviction was not related to the use of drugs or alcohol and there was no evidence that he abused drugs or alcohol, a condition allowing defendant's probation officer to require him to submit to random urinalysis testing was invalid. State v. Putnam, 200 Vt. 257, 130 A.3d 836 (Sept. 4, 2015).

       <p>
        Probation condition stating that defendant was not to drink alcoholic beverages to the extent it interfered with his employment or the welfare of himself or his family, and that he had to submit to an alco sensor test if required by his probation officer was not supported by sufficient evidence of a reasonable relationship between defendant, the crime for which he was convicted, and the condition. Drinking alcohol to excess was not criminal, and there was no evidence that defendant's conduct leading to his conviction was related to alcohol use. State v. Putnam, 200 Vt. 257, 130 A.3d 836 (Sept. 4, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Insofar as defendant was convicted of a crime relating to the operation of a motor vehicle, the court could reasonably conclude that a probation condition specifically requiring that defendant not drive without a license was reasonably related to his rehabilitation.

       </p>
       <p>
        Probation condition requiring defendant to repay any unpaid amounts due for any legal services provided at state expense solely applied to a court order arising from defendant's prosecution for the crime for which he was convicted and was therefore sufficiently related to his rehabilitation, in light of the crime of which he was convicted. State v. Putnam, 200 Vt. 257, 130 A.3d 836 (Sept. 4, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Probation condition requiring defendant to attend any counseling or training program designated by his probation officer and to participate to the satisfaction of his probation officer was an unlawful delegation of authority, as the probation condition gave the probation officer complete discretion in deciding whether and which counseling or training program defendant would attend, and was unsupported by particularized findings justifying not only the condition requiring counseling or training, but the broad delegation to the probation officer to determine the type of counseling or training. The error was plain, as the delegation deprived defendant of a substantial right and affected the integrity of the judicial process by giving the probation officer authority reserved to the courts. State v. Putnam, 200 Vt. 257, 130 A.3d 836 (Sept. 4, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Probation conditions relating to the supervision of defendant by his probation officer were reasonably related to aiding defendant in leading a law-abiding life in light of the crime for which he was convicted, and were within the trial court's discretion. State v. Putnam, 200 Vt. 257, 130 A.3d 836 (Sept. 4, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        There were no grounds to impose a probation condition requiring defendant to regularly work at a job, look for work, or get job training if required by his probation officer. Defendant was on disability at the time of the hearing, and there was no suggestion in the record that his criminal conduct was connected to his lack of employment or that getting a job, instead of remaining on disability, would help him become more stable or reduce his risk of reoffending; in fact, there was no evidence that defendant was capable of working. State v. Putnam, 200 Vt. 257, 130 A.3d 836 (Sept. 4, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the trial court neither ordered community service nor imposed restitution, probation conditions connected to community service and restitution imposed no real requirement on defendant and were inapplicable. State v. Putnam, 200 Vt. 257, 130 A.3d 836 (Sept. 4, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because there was no evidence that defendant was subject to any court orders concerning support for his family, that he had failed in any way to meet his legal obligations to any family members, or that the conduct leading to his conviction was part of a broader pattern of neglecting his responsibilities, including familial responsibilities, a condition requiring him to support his dependents and meet his family obligations was not reasonably related to defendant and the crime for which he was convicted such that it was a reasonable component of his rehabilitation. State v. Putnam, 200 Vt. 257, 130 A.3d 836 (Sept. 4, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Condition of defendant's probation that restricted his place of residence was not overbroad or unduly restrictive because it was related to the rehabilitative purpose of keeping defendant near the supervision of his family and his employer. State v. Pettitt, 197 Vt. 403, 104 A.3d 85 (2014).

       <p>
        Where a probation condition proscribed defendant's interaction with all children under the age of sixteen, but made no mention of specific public locations or events where children are often present, by prohibiting defendant from attending a fair, his probation officer converted the probation condition from a contact-based condition to a location-based condition, and in so doing, the officer crossed the line between condition interpretation and modification.

        By providing for mandatory one-year license suspension for DUI with fatality resulting, and vesting commissioner of motor vehicles with exclusive authority to calculate suspensions and revocations, Legislature did not expressly or impliedly preempt trial court's probationary power to limit a defendant's operating privileges for longer periods; had Legislature actually intended to eliminate trial court's discretion to prohibit a defendant from driving as a condition of probation for grave vehicular offenses, it would have plainly said so.

        Where defendant pleaded nolo contendere to simple assault and the information which formed the basis of the charge and the presentence investigation report revealed that the assault was of a sexual nature, probation condition that defendant participate in a sexual offender's counseling group was not an abuse of discretion, since it was reasonably related to the crime and might serve to protect the public against similar misconduct in the future.

        Probation condition requiring defendant to submit to polygraph examinations was related to the offense for which he was convicted, as this type of non-evidentiary use of a polygraph examination would help ensure that he was on track with both his rehabilitation and sex offender therapy, as well as ensure public safety, all of which related to the goals of probation and compliance investigation.

        Trial court did not err in ordering defendant, who was convicted of unlawful trespass after refusing to leave his ex-girlfriend's car, to complete a Domestic Abuse Education Program as a condition of probation even though he was not convicted of a crime of violence. The trial court provided reasonable grounds for its decision in that it found that the crime here had been motivated by power and control issues and that defendant needed to address these issues to prevent similar incidents from recurring. State v. Stokes, 194 Vt. 351, 83 A.3d 567 (2013).

       <p>
        As imposed, a probation condition requiring defendant to seek his probation officer's approval regarding his employment was overbroad and unduly restrictive, as it gave the probation officer the authority to control defendant's place of employment without any guiding standards, subject only to the qualification that approval "shall not be unreasonably withheld," and without any findings of fact explaining why such a broad delegation of authority was necessary. State v. Campbell, 199 Vt. 78, 120 A.3d 1148 (2015).

        Even if the probation order did not satisfy the requirement that a probationer be given a certificate explicitly setting forth the conditions of probation, there was no plain error, as defendant received a probation order listing all of the conditions, defendant was fully aware of the information that was allegedly not provided, and any error did not seriously affect the fairness, integrity, or public reputation of judicial proceedings. State v. Gauthier, 201 Vt. 543, 145 A.3d 833 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute requires only that the probationer receive a probation certificate; nothing in the statute requires a defendant to sign the probation certificate, and to hold that probation does not begin until a defendant signs a probation certificate would give a defendant veto power over when the terms of probation commenced. A signature acknowledging receipt of the probation certificate is one, but not the only, way to establish that a probationer has received the required probation certificate. State v. Anderson, 202 Vt. 1, 146 A.3d 876 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's failure to comply with the provision requiring that a probationer receive a certificate explicitly setting forth the conditions upon which he or she is being released makes the probation condition unenforceable. State v. Hemingway, 196 Vt. 441, 97 A.3d 465 (May 9, 2014).

       <p>
        When defendant did not receive a certificate explicitly setting forth his probation conditions, his violation of probation could not stand without the explicit written notice required by law. State v. Hemingway, 196 Vt. 441, 97 A.3d 465 (May 9, 2014).

       When the court imposes a sentence upon a defendant who has been convicted of an offense enumerated in section 204a of this title that includes a period of incarceration of more than one year to serve to be followed by probation, the court may make the probation contingent on the offender fulfilling specific stated conditions, such as taking part in treatment while incarcerated, and may modify, following a hearing pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the conditions of probation if a violation has occurred.
    The court shall review the probation conditions imposed at the time of sentencing after the incarceration portion of the sentence has been served, and prior to the offender's release to probation. Such review shall include information about the offender developed after the date of sentencing, including information about the offender's incarceration period.

       For an offender whose probation is contingent on fulfilling conditions pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the Department of Corrections shall prepare a prerelease probation report to the court at least 30 days prior to the release based upon information available to the Department.
    The prerelease probation report shall include the offender's degree of participation in treatment while incarcerated, whether conditions imposed under subsection (a) of this section were complied with, and other information relevant to the offender's release to the probationary sentence.
    The Department of Corrections shall provide a copy of the prerelease probation report to the attorney for the offender and the prosecuting attorney at the same time it provides the report to the court.

       If the Commissioner of Corrections believes the offender has violated a condition imposed under subsection (a) of this section, he or she may recommend a change to the original probation order.
    In this case, the court shall schedule a modification hearing prior to the release date.
    The court may modify the conditions or add further requirements as authorized by section 252 of this title.
    The offender shall have a reasonable opportunity to contest the modification prior to its imposition.

        Defendant failed in his argument that the court was without authority to both increase the portion of his sentence to serve and reimpose his probation with added conditions because each of these actions is granted by separate subdivisions of 28 V.S.A.
        §
        304(b). No reason can be found why the powers contained in the subsection must be mutually exclusive, and, in any event, the court's authority to add probation conditions is also granted by subsection (a) of this section, and there is no indication in this section that it cannot be used along with other powers. State v. Woolbert, 181 Vt. 619, 926 A.2d 626 (mem.) (April 2, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant's challenge to a condition of probation came five months after it was imposed, there was no error in the trial court's denial of defendant's pro se motion to modify. State v. Klunder, 179 Vt. 563, 892 A.2d 927 (mem.) (December 13, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Legislature placed the power to impose probation conditions on the court, and not on the corrections department and its employees; similarly, the power to modify probation conditions also rests exclusively with the courts. State v. Rivers, 178 Vt. 180, 878 A.2d 1070 (June 10, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Probation conditions contained in a sentence represent a contract between the probationer and the court; the court may modify those conditions where the modification is sought by the defendant. State v. Whitchurch, 155 Vt. 134, 577 A.2d 690 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since a probation agreement is contractual, changing the terms of probation without either the probationer's consent or a change in circumstances betrays the justifiable expectation that the agreement will be honored. State v. Day, 147 Vt. 93, 511 A.2d 995 (1986).

        Where a probation condition proscribed defendant's interaction with all children under the age of sixteen, but made no mention of specific public locations or events where children are often present, by prohibiting defendant from attending a fair, his probation officer converted the probation condition from a contact-based condition to a location-based condition, and in so doing, the officer crossed the line between condition interpretation and modification.

       <p>
        Under Model Penal Code upon which Vermont statute is based, where sentence is made a condition of probation and the probationer is discharged before the sentence is served, the defendant does not have to serve the sentence because the state could no longer enforce the probation condition. State v. Papazoni, 159 Vt. 578, 622 A.2d 501 (1992).

        Where conviction for driving under the influence, death resulting, resulted in sentence of 3 to 15 years, all suspended except one year of prison which was stayed pending an appeal during which time defendant completed probation and was discharged, argument was rejected that discharge from probation relieved defendant of all further obligations for the crime, including the one-year prison sentence; despite plain meaning, statute providing that upon fulfillment of probationary obligation a defendant shall have satisfied his sentence for the crime and cannot be required to fulfill his prison sentence
    does not apply to split sentences since such construction would be irrational and contrary to legislative intent of model penal provision from which statute derived. State v. Papazoni, 159 Vt. 578, 622 A.2d 501 (1992).

        When a prisoner on probation is convicted of a subsequent offense, criterion imposed by section 7032 of Title 13, governing imposition of consecutive sentences, that a subsequent conviction must occur before the defendant has been discharged from a prior sentence, must be read with reference to section 251 of this title, governing duration of probation, and this section; together, they permit a subsequent court, in its discretion, to impose a sentence consecutive to probation.

        Defendants who fit the statutory criteria of the statute regarding detention of a probationer following a charge of a violation have a statutory right to bail or release, and the conditions of that release should be determined by a consideration of the factors in the pretrial release statute. It remains the case that the court has discretion to release any probationer, but those probationers with a right to bail may not be held without bail. State v. Kane, 203 Vt. 652, 160 A.3d 1020 (mem.) (Nov. 22, 2016).

        Because defendant's underlying crime was a nonviolent felony and her probation violations - failing to meet with her probation officer, failing to keep a curfew, failing to report a change of address, and failing to comply with electronic monitoring - did not amount to new crimes, defendant had a right to conditions of release.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The fact that findings of a court at a probation revocation hearing are oral and transcribed, rather than prepared and typed subsequent to the hearing, does not alter the legal standard of appellate review; in either case, if the findings are deficient, a case may be remanded to the trial court for correction. State v. Allen, 145 Vt. 593, 496 A.2d 168 (1985).

        A probationer's federal due process rights are adequately protected when a court states its essential findings at a probation revocation hearing on the record. State v. Allen, 145 Vt. 593, 496 A.2d 168 (1985).

        After a revocation of probation, defendant's proper avenue for relief is through an appeal or habeas corpus proceeding. State v. Therrien, 140 Vt. 625, 442 A.2d 1299 (1982).

       <p>
        Permitting a motion for reconsideration of sentence under section 7042 of Title 13 after a revocation of probation would unnecessarily burden the revocation proceeding and unjustifiably give the defendant another chance to attack his original sentence.

       <p>
        Hearsay evidence admitted by the trial court in a probation revocation hearing with regard to defendant's discharge from a residential treatment facility did not meet any of the traditional guarantees of trustworthiness. There was no evidence to corroborate the hearsay allegations regarding defendant's misbehavior at the facility; the evidence contained judgments and conclusions, not objective facts; and the hearsay allegations were not factually detailed, but rather stated as general statements and conclusions. State v. Decoteau, 182 Vt. 433, 940 A.2d 661 (Aug. 31, 2007).

        Defendant's delay in completing a domestic violence program and his refusal to admit to the conduct underlying his offense at the intake interview in violation of program requirements were sufficient to support the probation violation found by the trial court and the extension of the probation term by an additional year.

        Probation is intended to allow a defendant opportunity for rehabilitation at the same time it protects society; revocation of probation will result when continuation of probation conditions would be at odds with need to protect public and society's interest in rehabilitation, in other words, when rehabilitative purposes of probation have failed and defendant is a threat to society.

        A court revoking probation need not specifically identify which of the alternatives set forth in subsection (b) of this section it has employed so long as at least one readily supports the court's conclusion. State v. Millard, 149 Vt. 384, 543 A.2d 700 (1988).

       <p>
        Following the establishment of a violation of probation the trial court erred in revoking defendant's probation and modifying his sentence without obtaining defendant's waiver. In re Jankowski, 203 Vt. 418, 157 A.3d 573 (Oct. 14, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        As the trial court was not reviewing a programming decision of the Department of Corrections or its internal consequences, but was deciding whether to revoke defendant's probation, remand was required when the trial court failed to determine whether defendant had violated a rule against physical violence or threats of physical violence, and when it did not exercise its discretion to determine whether the alleged violation was such that revocation should be ordered. State v. Cavett, 199 Vt. 546, 126 A.3d 1287 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was sufficient proof that defendant violated a probation condition that he not have relationships with people with children under 18. Although there was no direct proof that a woman whom defendant had been seeing had children under 18, it could be inferred from defendant's volunteering the information that they lived with their father out of state that they were minors; the trial court's conclusion that defendant had a relationship with the woman was also supported by evidence that he had exchanged phone numbers with her, borrowed her car, and bought roses for her. State v. Amidon, 188 Vt. 617, 8 A.3d 1050 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in revoking defendant's probation when it found that he had violated four conditions of probation, including one that he not have friendships or relationships with people who had children under the age of 18. There was sufficient evidence from the context of a remark by defendant that the children of an acquaintance were under age 18; defendant was procedurally barred from challenging the findings of violation, as his argument was not raised during the sentencing phase or during the evidentiary hearing; defendant's challenge to one of the four violations found did not implicate the validity of the entire proceeding; and defendant had waived his right to collaterally attack the condition in question by failing to challenge that condition after conviction. State v. Amidon, 188 Vt. 617, 8 A.3d 1050 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant, whose probation required him not to initiate or maintain contact with children under 18, was not found to have violated the condition based merely on incidental proximity contact in a public place. The evidence demonstrated that on a number of occasions defendant visited his son's residence, where he knew young grandchildren would be, and visited in the yard in the midst of the children; that some of these visits lasted hours; and that defendant freely mingled with the children. State v. Bailey, 187 Vt. 624, 992 A.2d 320 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Term "mingle" means more than proximity contact; rather, as defined in a dictionary, it means, "to associate or unite, as . . . persons by ties of relationship; to join in company." Therefore, defendant's conduct of freely mingling with children at his son's residence exceeded "mere proximity" to the prohibited class and violated a probation condition that required defendant not to initiate or maintain contact with children under 18. State v. Bailey, 187 Vt. 624, 992 A.2d 320 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        By visiting his family at their home and staying for periods of up to two hours, during which time he mingled with underage family members, defendant plainly initiated and maintained contact with members of the prohibited class in violation of a probation condition that he not initiate or maintain contact with children under 18. State v. Bailey, 187 Vt. 624, 992 A.2d 320 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the question of whether verbal threats constituted threatening behavior in the context of probation conditions had not been decided by the court, any error of law the trial court might have made in revoking defendant's probation for verbally threatening his landlord was not obvious. Thus, there was no plain error, and the court did not have to reach defendant's claim that his curfew violations alone, which he did not contest, did not support revocation. State v. Gilbert, 185 Vt. 602, 969 A.2d 125 (mem.) (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mildly retarded adult defendant's alleged inability to comply with conditions of probation at time of violation did not bar revocation of his probation, where evidence did not support defendant's argument that performance of probation warrant was impossible, and court took defendant's mental capacity into consideration at revocation hearing. State v. Lockwood, 160 Vt. 547, 632 A.2d 655 (1993).

        Where defendant was convicted in New York for operating "a motor vehicle while his ability to operate such vehicle [was] impaired by the consumption of alcohol," in violation of New York Vehicle and Traffic Law
        §
        1192(1), trial court did not abuse its discretion in revoking defendant's probation for violation of probationary condition that he not use alcoholic beverages to the extent that they interfered with his employment or the welfare of his family, himself, or any other person, since defendant posed a possible danger to the welfare of both himself and others by his operation of a motor vehicle while his ability to operate that vehicle was impaired by his consumption of alcohol.

        Where defendant was convicted in New York for driving while impaired, in violation of New York Vehicle and Traffic Law
        §
        1192(1), the fact that Vermont had no crime specifically denominated as driving while impaired did not necessitate reversal of trial court's revocation of defendant's probation for violation of probationary condition that he not be convicted of another offense.

        In a probation violation case, an administrative judge properly refused to presume bias of the trial judge based on the trial judge's comments at the original sentencing hearing, where the trial judge had warned defendant that if he did not abide by the probation conditions, he would see to it that he would serve as much of the remaining sentence as possible. While the comments could have been better phrased, they appeared to be a warning to defendant to abide by his probation conditions. State v. Bailey, 187 Vt. 624, 992 A.2d 320 (mem.) (2010).

       <p>
        Defendant failed in his argument that the court was without authority to both increase the portion of his sentence to serve and reimpose his probation with added conditions because each of these actions is granted by separate subdivisions of subsection (b). No reason can be found why the powers contained in the subsection must be mutually exclusive, and, in any event, the court's authority to add probation conditions is also granted by 28 V.S.A.
        §
        253(a), and there is no indication in that section that it cannot be used along with other powers. State v. Woolbert, 181 Vt. 619, 926 A.2d 626 (mem.) (April 2, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's sentencing power, once it has found a violation of probation, is limited to the alternatives explicitly laid out in subsection (a) of this section. State v. Pratt, 173 Vt. 562, 795 A.2d 1148 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        The language of subsection (a) of this section, when read together with 28 V.S.A.
        §
        205(a), did not impliedly give the option to the sentencing court to suspend part of the underlying sentence. State v. Pratt, 173 Vt. 562, 795 A.2d 1148 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Discretionary language in 28 V.S.A.
        §
        304 conflicted with mandatory and more specific language in 13 V.S.A.
        <span class="s1">

        7041, and therefore trial court properly ruled that it was required to impose sentence after finding defendant violated a condition of probation outlined in his deferred-sentence agreement. State v. Rafuse, 168 Vt. 631, 726 A.2d 18 (mem.) (1998).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Absent a showing that the trial court abused or withheld its discretion, the enforcement of the original sentence after a finding of violation of probation is without error. State v. Peck, 149 Vt. 617, 547 A.2d 1329 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a violation of probation is established, the trial court has discretion to revoke probation and require the original sentence to be served, continue probation, or alter the conditions of probation. State v. Therrien, 140 Vt. 625, 442 A.2d 1299 (1982).

         3. Alteration of sentence.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Since all four of defendant's sentences were to be served concurrently, trial court acted improperly in severing defendant's sentence on one charge after he admitted violating conditions of his probation, where effect was to alter defendant's sentence on that charge from concurrent to consecutive, to be served after he was released from incarceration on other three charges. State v. Draper, 167 Vt. 636, 712 A.2d 894 (mem.) (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's delay in completing a domestic violence program and his refusal to admit to the conduct underlying his offense at the intake interview in violation of program requirements were sufficient to support the probation violation found by the trial court and the extension of the probation term by an additional year. State v. Provost, 199 Vt. 568, 133 A.3d 826 (Aug. 1, 2014).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Following the establishment of a violation of probation the trial court erred in revoking defendant's probation and modifying his sentence without obtaining defendant's waiver. In re Jankowski, 203 Vt. 418, 157 A.3d 573 (Oct. 14, 2016).
        <br/>
       </p>
       <p>
        As the trial court was not reviewing a programming decision of the Department of Corrections or its internal consequences, but was deciding whether to revoke defendant's probation, remand was required when the trial court failed to determine whether defendant had violated a rule against physical violence or threats of physical violence, and when it did not exercise its discretion to determine whether the alleged violation was such that revocation should be ordered. State v. Cavett, 199 Vt. 546, 126 A.3d 1287 (2015).

        Under the parole eligibility statute, an inmate with a sentence having no minimum term or a zero minimum term and a maximum of one year shall be eligible for parole within those twelve months; that eligibility could come at any time during the twelve month period. This section does not indicate any legislative intent to prevent inmates convicted of offenses with statutory maximums of one year from being eligible for parole. State v. Kenvin, 191 Vt. 30, 38 A.3d 26 (2011).

       <p>
        Due process requirement that a parolee be afforded the right to confront and cross-examine adverse witnesses at a parole revocation hearing guarantees the parolee an opportunity to test the credibility and veracity of testimony used against him. Baxter v. Vermont Parole Board, 145 Vt. 644, 497 A.2d 362 (1985), overruled on other grounds, Watker v. Vermont Parole Board (1991) 157 Vt. 72, 596 A.2d 1277.

        The mandates of due process and the standard of proof are substantially less rigid at a parole revocation hearing than at a criminal trial. Baxter v. Vermont Parole Board, 145 Vt. 644, 497 A.2d 362 (1985), overruled on other grounds, Watker v. Vermont Parole Board (1991) 157 Vt. 72, 596 A.2d 1277.

         2. Standard of proof.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The substantial evidence standard of 28 V.S.A.
        §
        552(b)(2) requires that there be such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion; under this standard, a parolee may be found in violation of parole conditions even though the State cannot prove the violation by a preponderance of the evidence. Relation v. Vermont Parole Board, 163 Vt. 534, 660 A.2d 318 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The first factor to consider in determining the constitutionality of the standard of proof required to establish a parole violation is the parolee's interest in continued conditional liberty, which is at least as great as the interest of the prisoner in accurate fact-finding in a prison disciplinary proceeding and entails many of the core values of unqualified liberty, including, subject to conditions, the freedom to seek gainful employment and to be with family and friends. Relation v. Vermont Parole Board, 163 Vt. 534, 660 A.2d 318 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Applying any standard that calls for less than a preponderance of the evidence at the fact-finding stage of a parole-revocation proceeding invites error, allowing the Parole Board to revoke parole even where the evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that there has been no violation of conditions. Relation v. Vermont Parole Board, 163 Vt. 534, 660 A.2d 318 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        At the fact-finding stage of a parole revocation proceeding, the government has an undeniably strong interest in being able to return the individual to imprisonment without the burden of a new adversary criminal trial but only if in fact he has failed to abide by the conditions of his parole; the government has no interest in revoking parole where the weight of evidence indicates there has been no parole violation. Relation v. Vermont Parole Board, 163 Vt. 534, 660 A.2d 318 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Imposing a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard to establish a parole revocation will present little if any administrative burden on the government as the parolee is entitled to an opportunity to be heard and to present witnesses, and has the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses, unless good cause is shown to deny confrontation, and it will require little if any change in the current procedure to require that the findings be based on a preponderance of the evidence rather than simply on substantial evidence. Relation v. Vermont Parole Board, 163 Vt. 534, 660 A.2d 318 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Imposing the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard on the State in the fact-finding stage of a parole revocation proceeding will greatly reduce the risk of erroneous parole violations while imposing minimal burden on the government. Relation v. Vermont Parole Board, 163 Vt. 534, 660 A.2d 318 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unlike a criminal prosecution, a parole violation does not need to be established beyond a reasonable doubt. Baxter v. Vermont Parole Board, 145 Vt. 644, 497 A.2d 362 (1985), overruled on other grounds, Watker v. Vermont Parole Board (1991) 157 Vt. 72, 596 A.2d 1277.

        Rule set forth in Baxter v. Vermont Parole Bd., 145 Vt. 644, 497 A.2d 362 (1985), that a parolee's failure to testify in the face of hearsay charges may supply the corroboration or substantial evidence needed to support a parole violation, is overruled; instead, reviewing court is to analyze the quality - the underlying reliability and probative value - of the hearsay, and evaluate the weight each item of hearsay should receive according to the item's truthfulness, reasonableness, and credibility. Watker v. Vermont Parole Board, 157 Vt. 72, 596 A.2d 1277 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Parole Board's decision finding plaintiff in violation of parole conditions was supported by substantial evidence, where State's hearsay evidence concerning plaintiff's alleged beating of cohabitant was credible and reliable, and plaintiff's live testimony was not. Watker v. Vermont Parole Board, 157 Vt. 72, 596 A.2d 1277 (1991).

       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial evidence, required by subdivision (b)(2) of this section to establish a parole violation, is such relevant evidence as a reasonable mind might accept as adequate to support a conclusion. Baxter v. Vermont Parole Board, 145 Vt. 644, 497 A.2d 362 (1985), overruled on other grounds, Watker v. Vermont Parole Board (1991) 157 Vt. 72, 596 A.2d 1277.
       </p>
       <p>
        Because a parole revocation hearing is not the same as a criminal prosecution, the process in a parole hearing is flexible and permits consideration of evidence such as letters, affidavits, and other material that would not be admissible in an adversary criminal trial. Baxter v. Vermont Parole Board, 145 Vt. 644, 497 A.2d 362 (1985), overruled on other grounds, Watker v. Vermont Parole Board (1991) 157 Vt. 72, 596 A.2d 1277.
       </p>
       <p>
        A conviction would be only one way in which the Parole Board could find that a parolee violated a condition of his parole by committing a new crime. Baxter v. Vermont Parole Board, 145 Vt. 644, 497 A.2d 362 (1985), overruled on other grounds, Watker v. Vermont Parole Board (1991) 157 Vt. 72, 596 A.2d 1277.
       </p>
       <p>
        To establish a parole violation, all that is required is that the evidence and facts reasonably demonstrate that the person's conduct has not been as good as required by the terms and conditions of the release. Baxter v. Vermont Parole Board, 145 Vt. 644, 497 A.2d 362 (1985), overruled on other grounds, Watker v. Vermont Parole Board (1991) 157 Vt. 72, 596 A.2d 1277.
       </p>
       <p>
        At parole revocation hearing, a police department incident report and a letter indicating that parolee had violated conditions of his parole, together with parolee's failure to rebut the allegations, constituted relevant evidence which a reasonable mind could accept as adequate to support the conclusion that parolee violated conditions of his parole. Baxter v. Vermont Parole Board, 145 Vt. 644, 497 A.2d 362 (1985), overruled on other grounds, Watker v. Vermont Parole Board (1991) 157 Vt. 72, 596 A.2d 1277.

       </h5>
       <p>
        A parole revocation decision consists of two steps: first, there is a factual determination of whether the parolee has violated the conditions of parole and, if the Parole Board concludes that there has been a violation, the second step is to determine whether a revocation is warranted. Relation v. Vermont Parole Board, 163 Vt. 534, 660 A.2d 318 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the first step in a parole revocation determination requires fact-finding, the second step involves predictive and discretionary decisionmaking. Relation v. Vermont Parole Board, 163 Vt. 534, 660 A.2d 318 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Provided there is substantial evidence to support the Parole Board's finding that a parolee has committed a new crime in violation of his parole agreement, that finding will be upheld even though it is not based on a conviction. Baxter v. Vermont Parole Board, 145 Vt. 644, 497 A.2d 362 (1985), overruled on other grounds, Watker v. Vermont Parole Board (1991) 157 Vt. 72, 596 A.2d 1277.

       <p>
        Transfer pursuant to this section violates no federal constitutional guarantee. Girouard v. Hogan, 135 Vt. 448, 378 A.2d 105 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Transfer pursuant to this section did not constitute exile because the transfer was not for the purpose of depriving prisoner of claimed constitutional right to freely inhabit the State; such freedom was forfeited by sentence of incarceration, wherever served, and would be restored in consequence of release from confinement. Girouard v. Hogan, 135 Vt. 448, 378 A.2d 105 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        The solution of the State's correctional need for providing maximum security for certain of its prisoners upon closing of State's only maximum security prison provided for by this section does not justify a finding that involuntary out-of-state transfer of prisoner is either cruel or unusual punishment prohibited by the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Battick v. Stoneman, 421 F. Supp. 213 (D. Vt. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the classifications created by this section are not patently arbitrary and bear a rational relationship to legitimate government interests of public safety, the welfare of prisoners, and the maintaining of security, safety, and order at correctional facilities, interests which, in the absence of a maximum security facility in the State, can be served by transferring prisoners requiring maximum security detention to federal facilities, this section does not on its face violate the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Rebideau v. Stoneman, 398 F. Supp. 805 (D. Vt. 1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where differences in treatment between federal prisoners and Vermont prisoners were not shown to affect constitutionally protected rights, and the impairment, for prisoners transferred to federal facilities, of visitation of family and friends and the difficulties of access to Vermont counsel were problems not presenting constitutional barriers to the operation of this section's statutory design, it would not be found that this section was in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment due to the differences in treatment. Rebideau v. Stoneman, 398 F. Supp. 805 (D. Vt. 1975).

        The decision to transfer a prisoner from one facility to another, entrusted by this section to the discretion of the Commissioner of Corrections, is administrative, not judicial. Battick v. Stoneman, 421 F. Supp. 213 (D. Vt. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the 1975 amendment of this section was designed to accommodate the closing of the State's only maximum security prison, a contingency that did not confront the Legislature in 1971 when it revised the State's correctional system, the remedial nature of this section entitled it to a liberal construction.

        Since section 703 of this title, governing transfer of a prisoner for psychiatric care, is more specific than this section, section 703 is the controlling authority when the two sections conflict. Goodemote v. Scripture, 140 Vt. 525, 440 A.2d 150 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the purpose of the transfer of a prisoner to a federal prison was to obtain involuntary psychiatric care for the prisoner, the procedural safeguards of section 703 of this title, dealing with transfers of prisoners to mental health care facilities, were triggered and the criteria in that section, rather than this section, governed the transfer.

       <p>
        Commissioner's decision to transfer prisoner with medical problem being treated by Vermont specialist to out-of-state federal correctional facility was not arbitrary nor generated from capricious or impermissible reasons where the record disclosed that the Commissioner took pains to confirm that competent medical treatment would be afforded the prisoner in the federal system, that the hearing officer and finally the Commissioner gave appropriate consideration to retaining the prisoner in Vermont in the available facilities, and where the Commissioner's final decision was based on the lack of correctional facilities and rehabilitative programs for long term offenders, who for reasons of security and the nature of their offenses were required to serve their sentences in close custody.

       <p>
        State prisoner, considered for transfer to out-of-state federal correctional facility following closing of State's only maximum security prison, who appeared in person before Corrections Department classification committee and discussed alternatives, who upon notice of committee's recommendation of transfer appeared in person and with trained lay counsel of his own choosing before hearing officer of Department's transfer committee, who had full opportunity to present evidence and called witnesses who testified in his behalf, and who conceded that the hearing officer was fair, was afforded procedural safeguards to which he was entitled.

      The Department shall establish an offender reintegration process that requires offenders to be held accountable to their victims and the community. This process shall provide opportunities for victims of crime and other members of the community to participate in reentry programs under section 2a of this title and to allow for victims and members of the communities to provide input to the Department as provided for in subsection 104(a) of this title. Such input shall include the nature of the planned supervision, the offender's work and education needs, the potential impact to the victim(s) of the offender's presence in the community, and the opportunities to make use of the offender's abilities within the community. An offender who participates in the reintegration process provided for in this subchapter may be placed in the community under the Department's supervision for the remainder of the sentence if the Department is satisfied that the offender is demonstrating progress in his or her reentry programs and that the offender does not present an unreasonable risk to his or her victims or to the community at large.

The rules shall establish the compensation, medical and vocational benefits to which an injured offender may be entitled as well as procedures for resolving disputes.

        Plain language of the statute regarding telephone calls by inmates conclusively indicates that it gives inmates access to debit calling cards: the language "when an inmate requests and receives a list of parties approved to receive telephone calls, the inmate shall be provided the option of using a debit or collect call system to place such calls" makes clear that the inmate is provided the choice and that the choice is between "a debit or collect call system." Any inmate who falls within the scope of the statute must therefore be given the choice of using a debit calling card or calling collect. Nichols v. Hofmann, 188 Vt. 1, 998 A.2d 1040 (2010).

        Inmate's claim for mandamus relief was sufficiently stated, as he established the elements to show that he had a clear legal right to the relief sought of having the Department of Corrections seek a competitive contract for telephone services to inmates.

        Inmate's allegation that Vermont law required the Department of Corrections (DOC) to use competitive bidding to contract for telephone services and that DOC violated this requirement by using a sole-source contract provided DOC with sufficient notice of the basis of his claim for purposes of surviving a dismissal motion.

The Commissioner shall develop a policy regarding the application for, standards for eligibility of, and supervision of persons on medical furlough. The offender may be released to a hospital, hospice, other licensed inpatient facility, or other housing accommodation deemed suitable by the Commissioner.

        Subdivision (a) of this section provided ample authority for Department of Corrections to place offenders on furlough and to attach binding conditions on that furlough; it did not require department to adopt rules and regulations to implement statutory purposes.

        Statutes setting forth purposes of Department of Corrections and responsibilities of Commissioner did not compel conclusion that Vermont furlough statute required individual furlough assessments for each inmate prior to inmate's minimum release date.

       <p>
        If in fact the 2001 amendment to the furlough statute created a sufficient risk of eliminating an inmate's eligibility for parole, then the inmate's claim of an Ex Post Facto Clause violation might prevail. Whether the amendment here produced a significant risk of increasing the inmate's sentence could not be determined without the factual development precluded by trial court's granting of a motion to dismiss. Girouard v. Hofmann, 186 Vt. 153, 981 A.2d 419 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Assuming that plaintiff's extended furlough was a constitutionally protected right, the federal appellate court held that plaintiff received all the process that was due under the Fourteenth Amendment when prison officials revoked plaintiff's extended furlough even where prison officials failed to follow Vermont Department of Corrections' procedures. Holcomb v. Lykens, 337 F.3d 217 (2d Cir. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        United States Constitution would not recognize a liberty interest in furlough status under existing Vermont law as a state-created liberty interest. Conway v. Cumming, 161 Vt. 113, 636 A.2d 735 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        No liberty in furlough status may be asserted directly under United States Constitution. Conway v. Cumming, 161 Vt. 113, 636 A.2d 735 (1993).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Change in Department of Corrections policy, which would make prisoners convicted of violent felonies ineligible for furlough until expiration of their minimum sentences, did not violate Vermont's furlough statute since, by delaying individual furlough assessments for such prisoners until they had completed their minimum sentences, Commissioner was not exercising his discretion in a manner inconsistent with furlough statute or criteria contained therein.

        Even though the term "order" was not technically used to describe the document governing defendant's furlough, it was executed in accordance with this section by the commissioner's authority; thus, there was sufficient evidence proving that the conditional reentry form and weekly schedules were an order for purposes of the escape statute.

       An offender may be sentenced to serve a term of imprisonment, but placed by a court on treatment furlough to participate in such programs administered by the Department in the community that reduce the offender's risk to reoffend or that provide reparation to the community in the form of supervised work activities.

       Provided the approval of the sentencing judge, if available, otherwise a Superior Court judge, is first obtained, the Department may place on treatment furlough an offender who has not yet served the minimum term of the sentence, who, in the Department's determination, needs residential treatment services not available in a correctional facility. The services may include treatment for substance abuse or personal violence or any other condition that the Department has determined should be addressed in order to reduce the offender's risk to reoffend or cause harm to himself or herself or to others in the facility. The offender shall be released only to a hospital or residential treatment facility that provides services to the general population. The State's share of the cost of placement in such a facility, net of any private or federal participation, shall be paid pursuant to memoranda of agreement between and within State agencies reflective of their shared responsibilities to maximize the efficient and effective use of State resources. In the event that a memorandum of agreement cannot be reached, the Secretary of Administration shall make a final determination as to the manner in which costs will be allocated.

        A conditionally pardoned convict is looked upon as being constantly in the custody of the Governor, who is regarded as his jailer. In re De Palo, 101 Vt. 510, 144 A. 678 (1929).

       </h5>
       <p>
        A pardon could be made subject to any conditions, provided they were not unlawful, unreasonable, immoral, or impossible of performance; and when accepted by prisoner, especially when agreed to in writing, conditions became binding upon him. In re Charizio, 120 Vt. 208, 138 A.2d 430, cert. denied, 356 U.S. 962, 78 S. Ct. 1001, 2 L. Ed. 2d 1069 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        A conditional pardon is a grant, which becomes valid only on acceptance of it by the convict, who can reject it, but who on accepting it takes it subject to all the conditions in the grant. In re Lorette, 126 Vt. 286, 228 A.2d 790 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prisoner, accepting conditional pardon, voluntarily submits himself to conditions stated therein and is bound by them. In re Saucier, 122 Vt. 208, 167 A.2d 368 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a conditional pardon, accepted by a convict, contains a provision that upon noncompliance with the conditions the convict may be apprehended and remitted to his former custody upon the Governor's warrant, issued for that purpose, such provision is binding, and the Governor may proceed in accordance therewith. In re Saucier, 122 Vt. 208, 167 A.2d 368 (1961).

        Under this section, the investigation, inquiry, and consideration as to the breach of condition of a pardon is the sole prerogative of the Governor. In re Saucier, 122 Vt. 208, 167 A.2d 368 (1961); In re St. Amour, 127 Vt. 576, 255 A.2d 667 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although under this section the Governor is the sole and exclusive judge as to whether the conditions of a pardon have been violated, he may not, in the absence of statutory authority, designate something as a breach of condition where no such condition is expressed in the pardon or recommit the pardoned convict where it concededly appears that the conditions have been complied with. In re Paquette, 112 Vt. 441, 27 A.2d 129 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        Provision of this section placing the Governor in the position of a surety on recognizance was intended to be exercised only in connection with power to order arrest and remand to custody, when, in judgment of the Governor, a condition of the pardon has been violated.

        Prisoner who accepted conditional pardon voluntarily submitted to conditions stated in it, and prisoner's recommitment to prison without hearing for breach of conditions of his conditional pardon was not a violation of his constitutional rights. In re Lorette, 126 Vt. 286, 228 A.2d 790 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        A conditional pardon is an act of grace or favor upon the part of the State by its Governor, and may be revoked without notice to the convict and without giving him an opportunity to be heard. In re Saucier, 122 Vt. 208, 167 A.2d 368 (1961); In re St. Amour, 127 Vt. 576, 255 A.2d 667 (1969).

        After release under a conditional pardon, neither the Commissioner of Public Welfare nor the superintendent of the house of correction could recommit prisoner to prison or jail, in the absence of a warrant issued by the Governor for breach of conditions of the pardon.

       <p>
        Time spent by prisoner in custody of Governor under conditional pardon was not time during which prisoner was serving his sentence, and upon prisoner's commitment to prison for violation of terms of conditional pardon he was liable to confinement for whatever part of original sentence remained unserved.

        Defendant failed in his argument that his sentence was illegal because reducing the maximum sentence through good-time credits under this section made the effective maximum and minimum sentences the same, in violation of 13 V.S.A.
        §

      It is the intent of the General Assembly that the creation of one or more new work camps in fiscal year 2006 and after will help alleviate overcrowded conditions in the State's correctional facilities and permit Vermonters housed in out-of-state facilities to be brought home to Vermont. The General Assembly specifically does not intend the creation of new work camps to result in an increase in the total number of Vermont offenders sentenced to incarceration. Therefore, specific plans and programs developed by the Department of Corrections shall restrict placement in new work camps to those offenders who have been convicted of a nonviolent offense and who have served a portion of their current sentence within a correctional facility. No court shall impose a sentence of imprisonment to be served initially or solely within the new facility.

         1. Factors constituting punishment.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Prevention aims to remove the means to do something, while deterrence, by contrast, aims to convince a person not to do something that they retain the ability to do. Borden v. Hofmann, 185 Vt. 486, 974 A.2d 1249 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plain and ordinary meaning of "punishment" is more than broad enough to encompass the Department of Corrections' use of a Nutraloaf-and-water diet for deterrence. For instance, while a dictionary defines "deterrent punishment" as that which is intended to deter the offender and others from malfeasance, it also notes that "preventative punishment" is intended to prevent a repetition of wrongdoing by disabling the offender. Borden v. Hofmann, 185 Vt. 486, 974 A.2d 1249 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Nutraloaf-and-water regime constitutes "punishment" within the meaning of the statute pertaining to discipline and control of inmates. Before they may be placed on the diet, inmates are entitled to process in accordance with the subchapter. Borden v. Hofmann, 185 Vt. 486, 974 A.2d 1249 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        In considering what constitutes punishment of an inmate, three factors are particularly relevant: (1) whether the intent of the government officials is to punish; (2) whether the purpose of the restriction in question is for some legitimate governmental purpose; and whether the restriction is excessive in relation to its purpose. Conway v. Cumming, 161 Vt. 113, 636 A.2d 735 (1993).

         2. Termination of furlough.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Termination of inmate's furlough status and participation in sex-offender programs was not punishment. Conway v. Cumming, 161 Vt. 113, 636 A.2d 735 (1993).
       </p>

         3. Diet.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Stated goal of the program to reduce or limit offending behavior, together with the trial court's finding that Nutraloaf was designed to be unappetizing, compelled the conclusion that deterrence was central to the program, under which inmates were served a Nutraloaf-and-water diet in response to their abuse of food, utensils, or bodily waste. The principal aim of the Nutraloaf program was to deter. Borden v. Hofmann, 185 Vt. 486, 974 A.2d 1249 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Retribution and deterrence are traditional aims of punishment. A regime under which inmates were served a Nutraloaf-and-water diet in response to their abuse of food, utensils, or bodily waste was classic punitive deterrence. Borden v. Hofmann, 185 Vt. 486, 974 A.2d 1249 (2009).

        Due process requires that prisoners accused of disciplinary infractions not be punished for such actions unless their guilt can be shown by a preponderance of the evidence, and trial court correctly found that governing rule denied prisoners due process where it allowed hearing officers to impose discipline as long as there was "some evidence" of violation.

    Once effective, the compact shall continue in force and remain binding upon each and every compacting state, provided that a compacting state may withdraw from the compact (withdrawing state) by enacting a statute specifically repealing the statute which enacted the compact into law. The effective date of withdrawal shall be the effective date of such repeal. A withdrawing state shall immediately notify the chair of the Interstate Commission in writing upon the introduction of legislation repealing this compact in the withdrawing state. The Interstate Commission shall notify the other compacting states of the withdrawing state's intent to withdraw within 60 days of its receipt thereof. A withdrawing state shall be responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of withdrawal, including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of withdrawal.

    If the Interstate Commission determines that any compacting state has at any time defaulted (defaulting state) in the performance of any of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, the bylaws, or any duly promulgated rules, the Interstate Commission may impose any or all of the following penalties:
       <ol>

       Judicial enforcement.
    
    The Interstate Commission may, by majority vote of the members, initiate legal action in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia or, at the discretion of the Interstate Commission, in the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its offices to enforce compliance with the provisions of the compact, its duly promulgated rules, and bylaws, against any compacting state in default. In the event judicial enforcement is necessary, the prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney's fees.
      </li>
      <li id="t28c22s1362ol1d">
       Dissolution of the compact.
    
    The compact shall dissolve effective upon the date of the withdrawal or default of the compacting state which reduces membership in the compact to one compacting state. Upon the dissolution of this compact, the compact shall become null and void and shall be of no further force or effect, and the business and affairs of the Interstate Commission shall be terminated and any surplus funds shall be distributed in accordance with the bylaws of the Interstate Commission.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      Suspension shall be imposed only after all other reasonable means of securing compliance under the bylaws and rules have been exhausted. Immediate notice of suspension shall be given by the Interstate Commission to the governor, the chief justice or chief judicial officer of the state, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and the state council. The grounds for default shall include failure of a compacting state to perform such obligations or responsibilities imposed upon it by this compact, Interstate Commission bylaws, or duly promulgated rules. The Interstate Commission shall immediately notify the defaulting state in writing of the penalty imposed by the Interstate Commission on the defaulting state pending a cure of the default. The Interstate Commission shall stipulate the conditions and the time period within which the defaulting state must cure its default. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default within the time period specified by the Interstate Commission, in addition to any other penalties imposed herein, the defaulting state may be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the compacting states, and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of suspension. Within 60 days of the effective date of termination of a defaulting state, the Interstate Commission shall notify the governor, the chief justice or chief judicial officer and the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and the state council of such termination. The defaulting state shall be responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of termination, including any obligations, the performance of which extends beyond the effective date of termination. The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to the defaulting state unless otherwise mutually agreed upon between the Interstate Commission and the defaulting state. Reinstatement following termination of any compacting state shall require both a reenactment of the compact by the defaulting state and the approval of the Interstate Commission pursuant to the rules of the Interstate Commission.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The party states find that charges outstanding against a prisoner, detainers based on untried indictments, informations, or complaints, and difficulties in securing speedy trial of persons already incarcerated in other jurisdictions, produce uncertainties which obstruct programs of prisoner treatment and rehabilitation.
    Accordingly, it is the policy of the party states and the purpose of this agreement to encourage the expeditious and orderly disposition of such charges and determination of the proper status of any and all detainers based on untried indictments, informations, or complaints.
    The party states also find that proceedings with reference to such charges and detainers, when emanating from another jurisdiction, cannot properly be had in the absence of cooperative procedures.
    It is the further purpose of this agreement to provide such cooperative procedures.

       Whenever a person has entered upon a term of imprisonment in a penal or correctional institution of a party state, and whenever during the continuance of the term of imprisonment there is pending in any other party state any untried indictment, information, or complaint on the basis of which a detainer has been lodged against the prisoner, he or she shall be brought to trial within 180 days after he or she shall have caused to be delivered to the prosecuting officer and the appropriate court of the prosecuting officer's jurisdiction written notice of the place of his or her imprisonment and his or her request for a final disposition to be made of the indictment, information, or complaint: provided that for good cause shown in open court, the prisoner or his or her counsel being present, the court having jurisdiction of the matter may grant any necessary or reasonable continuance.
    The request of the prisoner shall be accompanied by a certificate of the appropriate official having custody of the prisoner, stating the term of commitment under which the prisoner is being held, the time already served, the time remaining to be served on the sentence, the amount of good time earned, the time of parole eligibility of the prisoner, and any decisions of the state parole agency relating to the prisoner.
      </li>

       The written notice and request for final disposition referred to in paragraph (a) hereof shall be given or sent by the prisoner to the warden, Commissioner of Corrections, or other official having custody of him or her, who shall promptly forward it together with the certificate to the appropriate prosecuting official and court by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested.
      </li>
      <li id="t28c25sub01s1503ol1c">
       The warden, Commissioner of Corrections, or other official having custody of the prisoner shall promptly inform him or her of the source and contents of any detainer lodged against him or her and shall also inform him or her of his or her right to make a request for final disposition of the indictment, information, or complaint on which the detainer is based.
      </li>
      <li id="t28c25sub01s1503ol1d">
       Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) hereof shall operate as a request for final disposition of all untried indictments, informations, or complaints on the basis of which detainers have been lodged against the prisoner from the state to whose prosecuting official the request for final disposition is specifically directed.
    The warden, Commissioner of Corrections, or other official having custody of the prisoner shall forthwith notify all appropriate prosecuting officers and courts in the several jurisdictions within the state to which the prisoner's request for final disposition is being sent of the proceeding being initiated by the prisoner.
    Any notification sent pursuant to this paragraph shall be accompanied by copies of the prisoner's written notice, request, and the certificate.
    If trial is not had on any indictment, information, or complaint contemplated hereby prior to the return of the prisoner to the original place of imprisonment, such indictment, information, or complaint shall not be of any further force or effect, and the court shall enter an order dismissing the same with prejudice.

       Any request for final disposition made by a prisoner pursuant to paragraph (a) hereof shall also be deemed to be a waiver of extradition with respect to any charge or proceeding contemplated thereby or included therein by reason of paragraph (d) hereof, and waiver of extradition to the receiving state to serve any sentence there imposed upon him or her, after completion of his or her term of imprisonment in the sending state.
    The request for final disposition shall also constitute a consent by the prisoner to the production of his or her body in any court where his or her presence may be required in order to effectuate the purposes of this agreement and a further consent voluntarily to be returned to the original place of imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of this agreement.
    Nothing in this paragraph shall prevent the imposition of a concurrent sentence if otherwise permitted by law.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Interstate Corrections Compact by its terms does not apply to contracts with privately operated prisons; the Compact governs contracts between states for the confinement of inmates on behalf of a sending state in institutions situated within receiving states. Therefore, claims raised by inmates transferred pursuant to the state's contract with a private company fell outside the scope of the Compact. Nichols v. Hofmann, 188 Vt. 1, 998 A.2d 1040 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme Court of Vermont has held that the Interstate Corrections Compact does not require that the policies of the sending state, with respect to issues like visitation, be applied in the receiving state. That holding is exclusively a construction of the Compact and does not suggest that Compact provisions shall be enforced even when the Compact is not applicable. Nichols v. Hofmann, 188 Vt. 1, 998 A.2d 1040 (2010).

        Contract with another state for the transfer of Vermont inmates did not violate the Interstate Corrections Compact on the basis that it delegated to the other state the right to designate the prison assignment of transferred inmates because, under the Compact, when prison officials of a party state determine that transfer of an inmate to another party state is necessary or desirable, "said officials may direct that the confinement be within an institution within the territory of said other party state, the receiving state to act in that regard solely as agent for the sending state."
