     <p>
      Lakes and ponds that are public waters of Vermont and the lands lying thereunder are a public trust, and it is the policy of the State that these waters and lands shall be managed to serve the public good, as defined by section 405 of this title, to the extent authorized by statute. For the purposes of this chapter, the exercise of this management shall be limited to encroachments subject to section 403 of this title. The management of these waters and lands shall be exercised by the Department of Environmental Conservation in accordance with this chapter and the rules of the Department. For the purposes of this chapter, jurisdiction of the Department shall be construed as extending to all lakes and ponds that are public waters and the lands lying thereunder, which lie beyond the shoreline or shorelines delineated by the mean water level of any lake or pond that is a public water of the State, as such mean water level is determined by the Department. For the purposes of this chapter, jurisdiction shall include encroachments of docks and piers on the boatable tributaries of Lake Champlain and Lake Memphremagog upstream to the first barrier to navigation, and encroachments of docks and piers on the Connecticut River impoundments and boatable tributaries of such impounds upstream to the first barrier to navigation. No provision of this chapter shall be construed to permit trespass on private lands without the permission of the owner.

     "(2) Vermont citizens are aware that laws and regulations designed to safeguard basic tenets of ethical business practice are disregarded in many workplaces, commonly referred to as "sweatshops."
    </p>
    <p>
     "(3) State government purchase of goods made under abusive conditions on behalf of the state's citizens offends Vermont citizens' sense of justice and decency.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(4) When the state of Vermont contracts with vendors whose suppliers profit by providing substandard wages and working conditions, Vermont's businesses are put at a competitive disadvantage.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(5) The state of Vermont believes in doing business with vendors who make a good-faith effort to ensure that their suppliers and those at the point of assembly adhere to the principles set forth in this act.

    <p>
     "(b) By this act, the general assembly intends that:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(1) In its role as a market participant that procures apparel, footwear, and textiles, the state of Vermont seeks to protect the interests of Vermont citizens and businesses by exercising its state sovereignty to spend Vermont citizens' tax dollars in a manner consistent with their express wishes that the state deal with responsible bidders who seek contracts to supply goods to the state of Vermont, and protect legally compliant Vermont businesses and workers from unfair competition created by downward pressure on prices and conditions attributable to businesses that violate applicable workplace laws.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) Seeking to protect these local interests through the least discriminatory means available, the state of Vermont requires that all bidders seeking contracts to supply the state of Vermont with apparel, footwear, and textiles provide certification that their suppliers at the point of assembly comply with workplace laws of the vendor's or supplier's site of assembly and with treaty obligations that are shared by the United States and the country in which the goods are assembled."

Subject to the provisions of subsections (b) and (c) of this section, the Commissioner of Buildings and General Services may reject any or all bids or quotations and with the approval of the Secretary of Administration, procure items in such manner as may be in the best interests of the State.

The Commissioner, in the Commissioner's discretion, may spend up to 10 percent more for comparable products that are made of recycled materials. If products made of recycled materials are to cost more than 10 percent more than comparable products, the Commissioner shall receive consent of State entities that are to use the product, before completing the order for the materials in question.

Proceeds from the sale of waste materials collected by the Department of Buildings and General Services shall be credited to a special fund and shall be available to the Department to offset the cost of recycling efforts. The goal for the purchase of recycled materials shall be at least 40 percent by the end of 2008. For purposes of this section, "recycled materials" include recycled paper products, retreaded automobile tires, re-refined lubricating oil, used automotive parts, reclaimed solvents, recycled asphalt, recycled concrete, and compost materials.

       </p>
       <p>
        The 1982 amendment to this section, allowing suits against the State to the extent the State purchased liability insurance, did not apply retroactively. Curran v. Marcille, 152 Vt. 247, 565 A.2d 1362 (1989).

       <p>
        Immunity waiver elucidated in this section makes no mention of the governmental unit vicariously enjoying an employee's immunity, and the Supreme Court would not strip this section of its plain meaning nor ignore the obvious intention of the Legislature. My Sister's Place v. City of Burlington, 139 Vt. 602, 433 A.2d 275 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        In this section governmental immunity is legislatively recognized and its waiver provided for only by, and to the extent of, insurance coverage in that area. Town of South Burlington v. American Fidelity Co., 125 Vt. 348, 215 A.2d 508 (1965).

       <p>
        Waiver of a municipality's sovereign immunity only occurred when a municipal corporation itself purchased liability insurance, and since town obtained its liability coverage through membership in an intermunicipal insurance fund, it did not waive its immunity from plaintiffs' wrongful death suit. McMurphy v. State, 171 Vt. 9, 757 A.2d 1043 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although section 1092 of Title 24 does not impose an absolute duty on a city to carry liability insurance on its motor vehicles and drivers, if there is insurance coverage, the defense of governmental immunity is not available to the municipality since it is waived by provisions of this section.

        This section does not constitute a waiver of the state's immunity to suit in federal courts under the Eleventh Amendment of the United States Constitution. Miller v. Vermont, 201 F. Supp. 930 (D. Vt. 1962); Lewis v. Vermont, 289 F. Supp. 246 (D. Vt. 1968).

        Transportation of an institutional inmate to and from an outside job is State business and the use of a State vehicle would constitute official use; therefore, to the extent of coverage, the State would be liable for an accident caused by an inmate while he was driving. 1970-72 Op.
