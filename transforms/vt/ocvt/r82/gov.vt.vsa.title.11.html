       <p>
        This section does not take property without due process of law since the law provides fees and mileage for witnesses, and any loss from inadequate fees is incident to the legitimate exercise of the powers of the government for the public good. In re Consolidated Rendering Co., 80 Vt. 55, 66 A. 790 (1907), aff'd, 207 U.S. 541, 28 S. Ct. 178, 52 L. Ed. 327 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not violate the fourteenth amendment of the federal constitution by discriminating between corporations and natural persons, and denying to the former equal protection of the laws; it merely eliminates the pre-existing discrimination by requiring of a corporation what could formerly be demanded of a natural person by subpoena duces tecum. In re Consolidated Rendering Co., 80 Vt. 55, 66 A. 790 (1907), aff'd, 207 U.S. 541, 28 S. Ct. 178, 52 L. Ed. 327 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        The provision of this section, authorizing a fine for contempt in case of refusal to produce documentary evidence when ordered, does not violate the fourteenth amendment of the federal constitution by depriving corporation of property without due process of law, since the proceedings for punishing the contempt are in accordance with the ordinary mode prescribed by law in such cases and adapted to the end to be attained. In re Consolidated Rendering Co., 80 Vt. 55, 66 A. 790 (1907), aff'd, 207 U.S. 541, 28 S. Ct. 178, 52 L. Ed. 327 (1908).

        Section is not in violation of the eleventh article of the constitution of Vermont, relating to the search or seizure of property and the certainty of description in warrants therefor, since it restricts the order to such books and papers as contain information concerning the subject of inquiry, and leaves it for the tribunal to determine only what books and papers are needed and to describe them in the order as far as practicable. In re Consolidated Rendering Co., 80 Vt. 55, 66 A. 790 (1907), aff'd, 207 U.S. 541, 28 S. Ct. 178, 52 L. Ed. 327 (1908).

        An order issued under this section, directing a corporation to produce certain documentary evidence before a grand jury, and contempt proceedings for a violation thereof, was not an infringement of the eleventh article of the constitution of Vermont relating to the search and seizure of property. In re Consolidated Rendering Co., 80 Vt. 55, 66 A. 790 (1907), aff'd, 207 U.S. 541, 28 S. Ct. 178, 52 L. Ed. 327 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        An order issued under this section, directing a corporation to produce before a grand jury certain books and papers, and sufficiently describing them, has the force of a subpoena duces tecum, and where it requires no search by the corporation to find the books and papers demanded and entails no hardship to produce them, the order does not constitute an unreasonable search and seizure in violation of the eleventh article of the constitution of Vermont. In re Consolidated Rendering Co., 80 Vt. 55, 66 A. 790 (1907), aff'd, 207 U.S. 541, 28 S. Ct. 178, 52 L. Ed. 327 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order issued against a corporation under this section, directing it to produce certain documentary evidence before a grand jury, and contempt proceedings for a violation thereof, were not contrary to the tenth article of the constitution of Vermont, which provides that no one can be compelled to give incriminating evidence against himself, since the corporation was not a party nor charged with any crime, but simply summoned to appear before the grand jury with the documentary evidence, where the privilege against self-incrimination could have been claimed if desired. In re Consolidated Rendering Co., 80 Vt. 55, 66 A. 790 (1907), aff'd, 207 U.S. 541, 28 S. Ct. 178, 52 L. Ed. 327 (1908).

       <p>
        If a foreign corporation doing business in this State, in anticipation of being called to produce its books and papers in a criminal proceeding, removes such books and papers from this to another state, it cannot be permitted to plead that act as an excuse for not obeying a subpoena to produce them. In re Consolidated Rendering Co., 80 Vt. 55, 66 A. 790 (1907), aff'd, 207 U.S. 541, 28 S. Ct. 178, 52 L. Ed. 327 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        Books and papers of a foreign corporation doing business in this State which are required as evidence in legal proceedings here, though they have been removed to another state by the corporation, are still within the jurisdiction of Vermont's courts, since the corporation is within that jurisdiction and the books and papers are within the control of the corporation.

      Such notice to produce shall issue from the court, magistrate, tribunal, or commission before which the production is required.

      The articles of association may provide for the purchase or redemption of the shares of any shareholder upon the death or disqualification of such shareholder, or the same may be provided in the bylaws or by private agreement.
    In the absence of a provision for the same in the articles of association or the bylaws or by private agreement, the professional corporation shall purchase the shares of a deceased shareholder or a shareholder no longer qualified to own shares in such corporation within 90 days after the death or disqualification of the shareholder, as the case may be. The price for such shares shall be the book value as of the end of the month immediately preceding the death or disqualification of the shareholder.
    Book value shall be determined from the books and records of the professional corporation in accordance with the regular method of accounting used by such corporation.
    If the corporation shall fail to purchase such shares by the end of said 90 days, then the executor or administrator or other person representative of a deceased shareholder or a disqualified shareholder may bring an action in the Superior Court for the county in which the principal office of the professional corporation is located for the enforcement of this provision. If the plaintiff obtains judgment in such action he shall be entitled to recover the book value of the shares involved and his costs.
    The professional corporation shall repurchase such shares without regard to restrictions upon the repurchase of shares provided by the general corporation law.

      Portions of bank deposits assigned to the scrip corporation shall be transferred on the books of the bank or trust company to such corporation and each portion so transferred shall be divided into two parts: a one-third part and a two-thirds part.
    The one-third part, hereinafter called the trust redemption part, both principal and interest, shall be the absolute property of such scrip corporation.
    The principal, but not the interest, of the two-thirds part, hereinafter called the security part, shall be deemed to be pledged to such scrip corporation to be used proportionately with all other bank or trust company deposits so pledged to it, to make up any deficiency in the trust fund needed to redeem all outstanding scrip.
    From time to time, the Commissioner may issue such regulations and orders as he or she may deem necessary for the protection of the holders of such scrip, requiring such percentage of such security fund, theretofore or thereafter accruing, to be paid into the redemption trust fund of such scrip corporation, or releasing from the lien aforesaid all or any part of the security fund accordingly as he may deem that all or any part of such security fund is no longer needed. Any part of the security fund released from the lien aforesaid shall be the absolute property of the assignor.

     <p>
      An association shall not issue stock to a member until it has been fully paid for.
    The promissory notes of the members may be accepted by the association as full or partial payment. The association shall hold the stock as security for the payment of the note, but such retention as security shall not affect the member's right to vote.
    Until such notes are paid in full, the corresponding stock, to the extent of unpaid balances, shall be carried on the books of the association and upon all financial statements made by the association as "capital stock issued for notes," and the notes shall be carried on such books and statements as "notes given for capital stock."

     <p>
      An association and its members may make and execute marketing contracts, requiring the members to sell, for any period of time, all or any specified part of their agricultural products or specified commodities exclusively to or through the association or any facilities to be created by the association.
    If they contract a sale to the association, it shall be conclusively held that title to the products passes to the association upon delivery except for legally recorded chattel mortgages given for value and prior to July 1 in any year on such products or commodities whether such mortgages are given before or after the making of such contract of sale.
    The contract may provide, among other things, that the association may sell or resell the products delivered by its members, with or without taking title thereto, and pay over to its members the resale price, after deducting all necessary selling, overhead and other costs and expenses, including interest or dividends on stock, not exceeding eight percent per annum, and reserves for retiring the stock, if any, and other proper reserves, and for any other reductions.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Two or more cooperative associations organized under, or which have adopted the provisions of subchapter 1 of this chapter, or similar laws of other states, whether having or not having capital stock, may merge or consolidate into one cooperative association which may be a new cooperative association or one of the constituent cooperatives by complying with the following requirements:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t11c07sub03s1061ol11">
       Notice of the proposed merger or consolidation, to which shall be attached a copy of the articles therefor in the form prescribed in subdivision (3) of this section, shall be mailed by each consolidating cooperative to its members, its stockholders of every class, the holders of its certificates of beneficial interest, and its former members to whom an allocated reserve is credited on its books, and published in a newspaper of general circulation in the area served by such consolidating cooperative not less than 30 days before the date of the meeting at which the consolidating cooperative acts upon such proposal.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c07sub03s1061ol12">
       Any present or past member of any consolidating cooperative having a property interest therein evidenced by its stock or its certificates of beneficial interest, or by an allocated reserve, may, not later than 10 days before the holding of such meeting, make a demand in writing upon the consolidating cooperative for payment of such property interest.
    If, upon the expiration of 60 days from the time the merger or consolidation is completed, the consolidating cooperative and all demandants have not agreed upon the value of the demandants' interest, such consolidating cooperative shall, within 60 days thereafter, apply by petition to the Superior Court in the county where such consolidating cooperative is domiciled for the determination of the value in appropriate securities or cash, as the board of directors of the newly formed cooperative shall determine, of the interest of each demandant who has made a demand in writing for payment of his property interest, as hereinbefore set forth, and who has not agreed thereto.
    Such petition shall state the names and addresses of each and every person who has made demand within the time specified and in the manner above provided. The consolidating cooperative shall notify each such demandant by mailing a copy of the petition and citation by registered mail, return receipt requested, to each demandant at his address as the same appears upon the books of the consolidating cooperative or to such other address as the court shall direct.
    Such notice shall be in lieu of any other notice, statutory or otherwise, and shall be sufficient to bring all parties so notified and the subject matter of the petition within the jurisdiction of the court.
    However, within 30 days from the mailing of such copy of the petition above referred to, the demandant, at his or her option, instead of proceeding as above set forth, may have such value ascertained by three disinterested persons, one of whom shall be named by the demandant, another by the consolidating cooperative, and the third by the two so named.
    The findings of these appraisers shall be final, and if their award is not paid by the consolidating cooperative within 30 days after it is made and notice given to the consolidating cooperative, the award may be recovered by the demandant of the consolidating cooperative in a civil action on this statute. The suit shall be stayed pending the action of the appraisers and shall be terminated by the presiding judge as to the demandant upon the filing of the findings of the appraisers with the consolidating cooperative.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c07sub03s1061ol13">
       If the articles of merger or consolidation are adopted by the affirmative vote of not less than two-thirds of the members attending and voting of each consolidating cooperative voting thereon at the meeting called to consider the same, or by not less than by a two-thirds vote of its delegates if qualified as provided in subdivision (4) of this section, articles of merger or consolidation in the form adopted shall be executed under its seal and acknowledged on behalf of each consolidating cooperative by its president or vice-president. Such articles of merger or consolidation shall recite that they are executed pursuant to this subchapter and shall state:
       <ol type="A">
        <li id="t11c07sub03s1061ol13A">
         the name of each consolidating cooperative and the address of its principal office;
        </li>
        <li id="t11c07sub03s1061ol13B">
         the name of the new cooperative and the address of its principal office;
        </li>
        <li id="t11c07sub03s1061ol13C">
         a statement that each consolidating cooperative agrees to the merger or consolidation;
        </li>
        <li id="t11c07sub03s1061ol13D">
         the names and addresses of the directors of the new cooperative; and
        </li>
        <li id="t11c07sub03s1061ol13E">
         the terms and conditions of the merger or consolidation and the mode of carrying the same into effect, including the manner in which the members of the consolidating cooperative may or shall become members of the new cooperative; and may contain provisions, not inconsistent with law or this subchapter, which are deemed necessary or advisable for the conduct of the business of the new cooperative.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t11c07sub03s1061ol14">
       In the case of any consolidating cooperative having a district election of delegates and a delegate system of voting as permitted by subdivision 995(10) of this title, in which, under its articles of association or bylaws, such delegates have complete voting power on behalf of the membership for every purpose, except that of their own election and the election of district directors, the vote adopting the merger or consolidation required by subdivision (3) of this section shall be that of not less than two-thirds of the delegates attending and voting at such meeting.
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      The president or vice president and the clerk or secretary of each consolidating cooperative executing such articles of merger or consolidation shall make and annex thereto an affidavit stating that the provisions of this section in respect to such articles were duly complied with by such cooperative.

        In a contract action for the balance due for advertising services, the record provided ample support of a finding of partnership where advertising for the real estate agencies of both defendants was placed with the plaintiff; both defendants used the same telephone number and address; both defendants placed advertising for the same properties; both defendants made payments on account as well as having made payment from corporations in which both had an interest; when one of the defendants had his real estate license revoked he operated under the other defendant's license; and where there was testimony, although conflicting, that one of the defendants received profits from the real estate office operation.

        As against third persons, a finding that a partnership was created by tacit agreement is determinative regardless of the parties' knowledge that their association created a partnership; where the issue hinges on the rights of the parties inter se only, there must be a manifestation of an intent to be so bound.

        Where evidence in action for treble damages under 13 V.S.A.
        §
        3606 established that defendant participated in logging operation, though he did not actually cut trees on plaintiffs' land, and received one-half of the net proceeds from sale of the logs, such evidence was sufficient to establish that defendant was engaged in a joint logging operation with the operator who actually cut the trees on plaintiffs' land. Lavalette v. Noyes, 124 Vt. 353, 205 A.2d 413 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        An agreement to share the profits and losses of an adventure is an essential element of a partnership and, ordinarily, is sufficient to constitute the parties to such agreement partners, and such joint interest may result even though one party furnishes the capital or stock and the other contributes his labor and skill. Raymond S. Roberts, Inc. v. White, 117 Vt. 573, 97 A.2d 245 (1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        Tenancy by the entirety and the sharing of gross returns do not of themselves establish a partnership, but a receipt by a person of a share of the profits of a business is prima facie evidence that he is a partner in the business. Raymond S. Roberts, Inc. v. White, 117 Vt. 573, 97 A.2d 245 (1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        Agreement to share in profits and losses of an adventure is essential element of partnership, and ordinarily is sufficient to constitute parties to such agreement partners, but such agreement is not always decisive of existence of partnership as between parties. Farmers' Exchange v. Brown, 106 Vt. 65, 169 A. 906 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        Agreement whereby parties have specific interest in profits as profits constitutes partnership, but agreement which gives person sought to be charged as partner a stipulated proportion of proceeds as compensation for his labor and services does not. Farmers' Exchange v. Brown, 106 Vt. 65, 169 A. 906 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        To constitute partnership, it is not necessary that each party furnish share of capital or property which is to become stock or subject matter of business, or be joint owner of it, since capital of association may vest and remain in one of members, but indispensable constituent is that parties shall be jointly interested in profits and affected by losses of venture. Farmers' Exchange v. Brown, 106 Vt. 65, 169 A. 906 (1934).

        .
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where the rights of the parties between themselves are concerned, and no question as to third parties is involved, the criterion to determine whether or not the contract is one of partnership must be what did the parties intend; this intention may be shown by their express agreement or inferred from their conduct and dealings with one another. Raymond S. Roberts, Inc. v. White, 117 Vt. 573, 97 A.2d 245 (1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not of the essence of a partnership that the parties to it should have known that their contract in law created a partnership. Raymond S. Roberts, Inc. v. White, 117 Vt. 573, 97 A.2d 245 (1953).

       </h5>
       <p>
        An individual debtor may not claim a homestead exemption in real property occupied by the debtor but owned by a limited partnership in which the debtor has an interest as a limited partner, since a partnership owns real property as a distinct legal entity separate and apart from the individual partners.

        Where husband and wife sold their partnership in 1967, and husband orally promised buyer, without wife's acknowledgment, that he would have it free and clear of the ten yearly payments should sellers die prior to full payment, and where wife, then husband, died in 1969, the husband's promise was not enforceable because wife had not also made it, or ratified it, and because of the statute of frauds provision requiring agreements which are not performed within one year to be in writing.

        Under this section, partners are both jointly and severally liable for torts and breaches of trust, but they are only jointly liable for contract liability. Concra Corp. v. Andrus, 141 Vt. 169, 446 A.2d 363 (1982).

        In a contract action for the balance due for advertising services, the trial court erred in holding the defendants jointly and severally liable under this section for the debt on the basis of section 1205 of this title, governing liability when a tort is committed by a partner; the defendants were only jointly liable and not both jointly and severally liable.

        Where one of two partners fraudulently endorsed check made out to another in the name of the payee, added his own endorsement and asked the other partner to deposit the check in the bank in the partnership account, and the proceeds were subsequently withdrawn and paid to the fraudulent endorser for his own use, the partnership was the customer which deposited the check and was credited with the amount of it; thus, the partnership became liable under this section on its warranty that it had good title, and the partner who had not taken part in the fraudulent endorsement, being liable for the partnership debts, was liable to the bank, which had been found liable to the drawer.

        Partner who, in negotiating sale of business, changed contract for sale to provide for a more favorable employment agreement for himself with the purchaser of the business without apprising his copartner, breached his fiduciary duty by excluding his copartner from the opportunity to seek a more favorable employment agreement with the purchaser than had been negotiated in his behalf, and copartner was entitled to an accounting.

     <p>
      A cooperative housing corporation may organize as a limited equity cooperative in order to fulfill the public purpose of providing and preserving housing for persons and households of low and moderate income at the time that they purchase their memberships.

     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t11c14s1598ol11">
       The articles of association shall require that cooperative interests be sold at no more than a transfer value determined by a limited equity formula contained in the articles.

      </li>
      <li id="t11c14s1598ol12">
       A limited equity formula, once established by a cooperative housing corporation in its articles of association, may be amended only if that amendment does not make the cooperative membership unaffordable for the class of low or moderate income households for which the cooperative housing corporation was originally incorporated, as determined and certified by the Commissioner of Housing and Community Affairs.
    A cooperative housing corporation once organized under this section may not reorganize as other than a limited equity cooperative without first dissolving.
      </li>
      <li id="t11c14s1598ol13">

        Although it did not appear from the certified copy of the registration that the defendant signed the statement of his partnership with his son, his signature was not necessary to accomplish a valid certificate of registration, for this section requires only the statement of one of the partners.

        Provision, requiring the return of a person doing business under a name other than his own to be filed in the office of the town clerk within ten days after the commencement of business, is merely directory; section 1626 of this title declares that any person conducting business contrary to the act may, upon complaint of the commissioner of taxes, be enjoined, and section 1634 of this title prohibits the institution of proceedings for the enforcement of any right or obligation unless the return has been filed and the registration fee paid prior to the issuance of the original writ, and so clearly recognizes the validity of claims accruing to one doing business in disregard of the ten-day requirement.

        Where spiritual leader and officer of religious association had only isolated contacts with the state involving matters unrelated to claim in suit, they were not "doing business" for purposes of this section, and motion to dismiss complaint would be granted for insufficiency of service of process and for lack of in personam jurisdiction.

        The term "business" in this section implies an employment or occupation that is continuing, and a single or isolated act of advertising under a name other than that of the plaintiff is not "doing business" under the name thus used. Johnson v. Cass & Emerson, 91 Vt. 103, 99 A. 633 (1917).

        When a person named John A. Smith does business under the name "John A. Smith, Carpenter and Builder," thus setting forth his name in full and simply adding thereto his trade or profession, nobody is misled, and such person need not be registered under this chapter. 1960-62 Op. Atty. Gen. 96.
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether certain transactions by a corporation in the name of an individual, such as advertising, carrying a small checking account in his name, and receiving cars from an automobile manufacturer under a previous contract entered into by the manufacturer with such individual, constituted doing business under an assumed name was a question of fact for the trial court. Corner Garage, Inc. v. Pullen, 96 Vt. 458, 120 A. 863 (1923).
       </p>
       <p>
        Chapter applied to a real estate agency consisting of the plaintiff and two other members doing business under the name of Lowell Real Estate Agency. Lowell v. Wood, 96 Vt. 218, 118 A. 887 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff used upon his stationery the words, "Johnson's Employment Office, W. L. Johnson, Prop'r" and "Johnson's Employment Agency, W. L. Johnson, Prop'r" and advertised his business under the name of "W. L. Johnson, Proprietor," except in three issues of a newspaper, when the advertisements read "Johnson's Employment Agency," there was no tendency to show that plaintiff was doing business under a name other than his own. Johnson v. Cass & Emerson, 91 Vt. 103, 99 A. 633 (1917).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiffs, A. H. Wilson and C. J. Wilson, were doing business under the firm name of "Wilson Brothers Garage," they were required to file the prescribed return and to pay the required registration fee. Wilson Brothers Garage v. Tudor, 89 Vt. 522, 95 A. 794 (1915).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the name of the business conducted by plaintiff was the Vermont Produce Company, a return giving the name as the Vermont Products Company was sufficient, for such a slight error was not likely to mislead. Nemie v. Todd, 89 Vt. 502, 96 A. 14 (1915).

       <p>
        A failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter prior to the issuance of process in which such an entity required to register is plaintiff makes the process void and deprives the court of jurisdiction. Wilson Bros. Garage v. Tudor, 89 Vt. 522, 95 A. 794 (1915); Amey v. Vermont Products Co., 107 Vt. 178, 177 A. 197 (1935); Enosburg Grain Co. v. Wilder, 112 Vt. 11, 20 A.2d 473 (1941).

        Although a corporation, which had done business in its own name, subsequently did business under an assumed name, failure to conform with this chapter did not preclude a recovery on rights or obligations that arose while the corporation was doing business in its own name.

       <p>
        The filing by defendants of a partnership certificate required by section 1621 of this title, after a contract upon which they were sued was made but before suit was brought against one of them, was not notice, actual or constructive, to the other parties to the contract of the existence of the partnership.

       <p>
        The direction of this section that a partnership required to register should not, upon failure to register, institute any proceedings, makes any process issued in violation thereof defective and not curable by waiver, consent or agreement.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        A motion to dismiss on the ground that the plaintiff had not registered as a partner as required by this chapter relates only to what appears of record, and where the record contains nothing the court must ascertain which party has the burden of proof. Enosburg Grain Co. v. Wilder, 112 Vt. 11, 20 A.2d 473 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        The presumption of jurisdiction of a court of general jurisdiction places upon the defendants the burden of producing evidence to show that the plaintiff cannot institute suit because it was not registered as a partnership as required by this chapter.

       <p>
        The trial court erred under prior Vermont law [11 V.S.A.
        §
        1416] in concluding that limited partners were agents of the landlord not subject to suit because there was evidence that the limited partners, along with the general partner, had contact with state water authorities supporting the inference that the limited partners participated in decisions, made on behalf of the partnership, to withhold information about the water from the tenants while not supplying an alternative source of safe water, thereby contributing to the ongoing breach of the partnership's habitability obligation. Willard v. Parsons Hill Partnership, 178 Vt. 300, 882 A.2d 1213 (August 5, 2005). (Decided under prior law.)

        §
        1397] in concluding that limited partners were agents of the landlord not subject to suit because there was evidence that the limited partners, along with the general partner, had contact with state water authorities supporting the inference that the limited partners participated in decisions, made on behalf of the partnership, to withhold information about the water from the tenants while not supplying an alternative source of safe water, thereby contributing to the ongoing breach of the partnership's habitability obligation.

     <p>
      Except as provided in the partnership agreement, a partnership interest is assignable in whole or in part. An assignment of a partnership interest does not dissolve a limited partnership or entitle the assignee to become or to exercise any rights of a partner. An assignment entitles the assignee to receive, to the extent assigned, only the distribution to which the assignor would be entitled. Except as provided in the partnership agreement, a partner ceases to be a partner upon assignment of all his or her partnership interest.

      On application to a court of competent jurisdiction by any judgment creditor of a partner, the court may charge the partnership interest of the partner with payment of the unsatisfied amount of the judgment with interest. To the extent so charged, the judgment creditor has only the rights of an assignee of the partnership interest. This chapter does not deprive any partner of the benefit of any exemption laws applicable to his or her partnership interest.
