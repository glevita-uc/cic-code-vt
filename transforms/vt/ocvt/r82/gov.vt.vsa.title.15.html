      1. Constitutionality.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     Stated governmental purposes underlying Vermont marriage statutes - furthering the link between procreation and child rearing, and promoting commitment between married couples to promote security of their children and community as a whole - provided no reasonable basis for denying legal benefits and protections of marriage to same-sex couples. Baker v. State, 170 Vt. 194, 744 A.2d 864 (1999).
    </p>
    <p>
     Same-sex couples were entitled, under common benefits clause of Vermont Constitution, to obtain same benefits and protections afforded by Vermont law to married opposite-sex couples; court's judgment was suspended, however, and current statutory scheme governing marriages was to remain in effect for a reasonable period of time, to enable legislature to consider and enact implementing legislation consistent with court's constitutional mandate. Baker v. State, 170 Vt. 194, 744 A.2d 864 (1999).

    <h5 id="t15c01-annotations-2">
     <b>
      2. Construction.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     Same-sex couples were not entitled to a marriage license under statutory scheme governing marriages in Vermont, since it was not clear that limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples violated legislature's "intent and spirit"; rather, evidence demonstrated a clear legislative assumption that marriage under statutory scheme consisted of a union between a man and a woman. Baker v. State, 170 Vt. 194, 744 A.2d 864 (1999).

        At common law, a married woman, having no separate estate nor property of any kind, could not bind herself, either at law or in equity, for the support of her infant child, although she had been abandoned by her husband and left to maintain herself and her child.

        This section has so enlarged the capacity of a married woman to contract that she may now make contracts generally, except with her husband, and except such as relate to her property not held to her sole and separate use, and her responsibility on her contracts affecting such property remains as at common law, unaffected by this section. French v. Slack, 89 Vt. 514, 96 A. 6 (1915).
       </p>
       <p>
        Capacity of married woman to make a contract did not depend on her holding property to her sole and separate use, so that after her death contract obligations were proved and allowed against her estate in the same manner as if she were unmarried at the time of contracting the liability, without any showing that she had separate property and that the avails of the contracts went to the benefit of such property, or to her benefit on the credit of such property.

        Statutory disability of contract between husband and wife presented no impediment to action by trustee on separation agreement of husband and wife with him, since undertakings of husband and wife were not between themselves, but severally with trustee, and he could enforce contract at law for benefit of spouse whom he represented.

        Although contract between married woman and her husband is void and unenforceable at law, it is, if fair and just, valid and enforceable in equity. Travelers Insurance Co. v. Gebo, 106 Vt. 155, 170 A. 917 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        Married woman is nonetheless sui juris to the extent of her enlarged powers under the statute when contracting with persons other than her husband, though her husband, or her husband and other persons, be joint, or joint and several, contractors with her.

       <p>
        Where a husband and wife sold and conveyed her farm that was not her separate estate, her responsibility for false representations made to induce the purchase must be measured by the common law, and not by this section, giving married women power to bind themselves and their separate property as if they were unmarried.

        Husband does not have freehold interest in real estate of his wife not held by her to her sole and separate use, overruling City of Barre v.

        If married woman purchases real estate which is conveyed to her without words of exclusion as to her husband and gives as security for part of purchase price mortgage of the same in which husband does not join, entire transaction cannot be treated as creating valid equitable mortgage. Proulx v. Parrow, 115 Vt. 232, 56 A.2d 623 (1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        If married woman's sole mortgage of real estate is taken as security for part of the purchase price of such real estate conveyed to her without words of exclusion as to husband, neither she nor her grantee with notice can be considered as trustee of grantor in respect to such property.

        Real estate conveyed to a wife by deed is not her separate property unless the deed contains explicit words excluding the husband from marital rights in such estate. Dietrich v. Hutchinson, 73 Vt. 134, 50 A. 810 (1901). But see Proulx v. Parrow, 115 Vt. 232, 56 A.2d 623 (1948).

        Where mutual deeds are necessary to the carrying out of contract and deed of one party is defectively executed, equity will not permit that party to claim under deed of the other if he refuses to remedy defect in his own deed upon demand. Proulx v. Parrow, 115 Vt. 232, 56 A.2d 623 (1948).
       </p>
       <p>
        When husband by virtue of marital relation has freehold interest in his wife's real estate, in order to make her conveyance thereof good he must be joined with her as grantor in body of deed; it is not enough that he merely join in execution of her deed. Dietrich v. Hutchinson, 73 Vt. 134, 50 A. 810 (1901). But see Proulx v. Parrow, 115 Vt. 232, 56 A.2d 623 (1948).

       <p>
        If deed of married woman has been defectively executed in that her husband did not join, equity will not decree execution of new conveyance to perfect title, nor if deed by a mortgage, treat it as valid and decree foreclosure. Chapman v. Long, 66 Vt. 656, 30 A. 3 (1894). But see Proulx v. Parrow, 115 Vt. 232, 56 A.2d 623 (1948).

        Where debtor conveyed his real estate to husband and wife upon condition that they pay his debts, and husband executed his promissory note to creditor for amount of debt and secured it by mortgage on portion of premises conveyed, wife not signing the mortgage, court of equity would not declare a lien on mortgaged premises as against wife.

       <p>
        The common-law necessaries doctrine, which holds that husbands are liable for necessaries such as food, clothing, shelter, and medical care that are provided to their wives, offends the principle of equal protection under the law. The proper remedy for such a violation is not to extend the doctrine to both wives and husbands, but is to abolish the doctrine altogether. Medical Center Hospital of Vermont v. Lorraine, 165 Vt. 12, 675 A.2d 1326 (1996).

       <p>
        How far wife's property, or its income, shall be subject to payment of husband's debts, is matter of legislative control as a part of marriage relation. Niles v. Hall, 64 Vt. 453, 25 A. 479 (1892).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that income of wife's real estate is, at particular period, liable for certain debts of husband in virtue of legislative enactment, does not give creditor, whose debt accrued during that period, any prospective interest in future income of such sale. Niles v. Hall, 64 Vt. 453, 25 A. 479 (1892).

       <p>
        Only those debts incurred by a husband in the "necessary upkeep" of property he held by the entirety with his wife, or debts incurred for the benefit of his wife's property, could be charged against the wife's estate for debts incurred by the husband. In re Estate of Elliott, 149 Vt. 248, 542 A.2d 282 (1988).

       <p>
        Wife's estate could not be held liable under this section for claim of hay furnished to her husband where evidence did not establish that the hay was used to feed cattle held by husband and wife as tenants by the entirety or that the haying served to benefit real estate held jointly by husband and wife. In re Estate of Elliott, 149 Vt. 248, 542 A.2d 282 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        It has long been established that the husband's interest in an estate by the entireties is not one which can be subjected to claims for his sole debts and hence tax liens asserted by the government arising out of husband's partnership business were void.

      When a married man is incapacitated for supporting his family, or deserts, neglects, or abandons his wife, or by ill-usage or criminal conduct gives her cause to live apart from him, or is committed to the Commissioner of Corrections, if the wife is of age, a presiding judge of the Superior Court, upon her complaint for that purpose, may authorize such wife to sell and convey her real estate, or personal property that came to the husband by reason of the civil marriage and that remains in the State undisposed of by him.
    Such judge may authorize a person holding money or other personal estate, to which the husband is entitled in her right, to pay or deliver the same to the wife.
    A married woman who is of age and lives apart from her husband and has lived apart from her husband more than one year from any cause other than her adultery, and who has real estate in her own right, may petition a presiding judge of the Superior Court for leave to sell and convey such real estate.

        This is a criminal statute, and while a parent who willfully neglects to provide for the support of his stepchild under sixteen years of age may be liable to prosecution, this section does not, in either express terms or by necessary implication, affect his civil liability for support of a stepchild, and the Vermont common-law rule is that he is not civilly liable for such support; however, a stepfather can create a parental relationship with a stepchild such that he would be responsible civilly for its care as if the child were his own issue or a child he had legally adopted.

      Before the trial, with the consent of the respondent, or at the trial on entry of a plea of guilty, or after conviction, instead of imposing the penalty provided in section 202 of this title, or in addition thereto, the court, in its discretion, having regard to the circumstances and to the financial ability or earning capacity of the respondent, may make an order that shall be subject to change by the court from time to time, as circumstances may require, directing the respondent to pay a certain sum periodically to the spouse or to the guardian or custodian of the child or to an organization or individual approved by the court as trustee or to a parent or his or her guardian.
    Such court may order the respondent released from custody and placed on probation, upon his or her entering into a recognizance, with or without surety, in such sum as the court, or a judge thereof in vacation, may order and approve.
    The condition of the recognizance shall be such that if the respondent shall make his or her personal appearance in court whenever ordered so to do and shall further comply with the terms of such order of support, or of any subsequent modification thereof, such recognizance shall be void, otherwise in full force and effect.

        Desertion and nonsupport statutes concern disposition, care and maintenance of children by the state child welfare agency "or to some person or suitable institution, as shall be equitable" where a parent is guilty of nonsupport or desertion; it is not at all plain that the statutes convey standing to any person to assert a custody claim, as opposed to authorizing the court to consider placement with a nonparent in dire circumstances. Even assuming, without deciding, that a mother's ex-partner, a nonparent, could seek custody of the mother's children as such a person, the predicates of parental desertion or nonsupport were not presented here.

       <p>
        The fact that a divorce complaint may be pending, or brought at a subsequent time, does not deprive the court of jurisdiction under this section. Paquette v. Paquette, 146 Vt. 83, 499 A.2d 23 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jurisdiction to award support to wife under this section applies only when relationship of husband and wife exists. Loeb v. Loeb, 118 Vt. 472, 114 A.2d 518 (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, on petition brought by resident wife against her nonresident husband for separate maintenance of herself and minor children, court has power to make order affecting petitionee's property within state without acquiring jurisdiction of his person. Wilder v. Wilder, 93 Vt. 105, 106 A. 562 (1919).
       </p>
       <p>
        County court in county where parties lived together before they separated, and where husband has lived since separation, has jurisdiction of such petition, though wife and child are living in another state. Stockwell v. Stockwell, 87 Vt. 424, 89 A. 478 (1914).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute prescribing residence necessary to give jurisdiction in divorce proceedings does not apply to petition under this section, by wife against her husband for contribution for care and support of their minor child. Stockwell v. Stockwell, 87 Vt. 424, 89 A. 478 (1914).

        To warrant court in making order as to the support of the wife upon the ground that wife is living apart from husband who refuses to maintain her, it must appear that she is so separated from her husband through some matrimonial fault of his. Morse. v. Morse, 65 Vt. 112, 26 A. 528 (1893).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where husband has always suitably supported his wife, is willing to continue to do so and requests her to remain, it is not justifiable cause for leaving him that her physical condition renders it more agreeable and convenient for her to live apart from him, and he is not in fault for refusing to support her after her departure.

       <p>
        This section 293 of this title, authorizing the superior court to make orders concerning children whose parents are living apart, clearly empower the court to award custody of a minor child to a stepparent while the parties are still married and when circumstances warrant.

         2. Construction with other laws.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        As integral parts of the statutory scheme, this section and section 291 of this title, authorizing the superior court to make orders concerning children in cases of desertion and nonsupport, must be construed in pari materia with other sections of the domestic relations law. Paquette v. Paquette, 146 Vt. 83, 499 A.2d 23 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was inappropriate to use a temporary order under section 672 of this title in divorce proceeding to function as an order under this section with respect to support and maintenance of minor children whose parents were living apart. LaVoice v. LaVoice, 125 Vt. 236, 214 A.2d 53 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        Remedy of this section is same as in actions for divorce, and same rule of construction applies. Loeb v. Loeb, 120 Vt. 489, 144 A.2d 825 (1958).

         3. Jurisdiction.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        This section did not apply in action commenced by the Vermont Office of Child Support (OCS) seeking a judgment in favor of the State of Iowa for past support Iowa provided to mother and the children; although father and mother lived separately as the statute contemplates, neither OCS nor Vermont's Department of Prevention, Assistance, Transition, and Health Access was a party in interest in the case because neither agency held an assignment of support rights from mother. Office of Child Support ex rel. Melissa Lewis v. Lewis, 178 Vt. 204, 882 A.2d 1128 (December 23, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the parties were never married, trial court had no jurisdiction under this section to order visitation privileges to plaintiff who claimed to be the father of defendant's child. Lawrence v. Limoge, 149 Vt. 569, 546 A.2d 802 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that a divorce complaint may be pending, or brought at a subsequent time, does not deprive the court of jurisdiction under this section. Paquette v. Paquette, 146 Vt. 83, 499 A.2d 23 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Effect of this section is that county court retains jurisdiction of that subject matter which it acquired in a former divorce proceeding, and proceeding under this section will be treated as further proceeding in original case, which should be brought forward on docket. Whittier v. McFarland, 79 Vt. 365, 65 A. 81 (1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where father and mother of minor child were divorced by county court and in habeas corpus proceeding, subsequently brought before judge of supreme court, custody of child was given to father and it was ordered that "these proceedings shall stand open for such further action as may hereafter be adjudged by this court to be right and proper in relation to the custody of said minor," said county court had jurisdiction of petition thereafter brought, under this section, by mother against father to obtain custody of child. Whittier v. McFarland, 79 Vt. 365, 65 A. 81 (1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme court is tribunal of law to regulate and control parents who have been divorced in respect to support and education of their minor children, and to determine how much each shall pay therefor and who shall have their care and custody. Buckminster v. Buckminster, 38 Vt. 248 (1865).

       <p>
        This section and section 291 of this title, authorizing the superior court to make orders concerning children in cases of desertion or nonsupport, clearly empower the court to award custody of a minor child to a stepparent while the parties are still married and when circumstances warrant.

      A stepparent has a duty to support a stepchild if they reside in the same household and if the financial resources of the natural or adoptive parents are insufficient to provide the child with a reasonable subsistence consistent with decency and health.

       <p>
        Requirement that a nonmarital child who seeks to inherit from a putative father must establish paternity through a timely parentage action and motion for genetic testing before the child reaches the age of 21 does not violate the federal constitution or the common benefits clause of the Vermont constitution. In re Estate of Murcury, 177 Vt. 606, 868 A.2d 680 (mem.) (December 13, 2004).

         2. Construction.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        It is logical to conclude that under the statute governing standing in parentage proceedings, a determination of parentage pursuant to "an action under this subchapter" includes the parentage presumption arising from a Voluntary Acknowledgment of Paternity. McGee v. Gonyo, 201 Vt. 216, 140 A.3d 162 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont's parentage statute does not authorize a court to allow a second parentage action involving a particular child brought by or against a different putative parent unless constitutional considerations require the court to entertain the second parentage case. Columbia v. Lawton, 193 Vt. 165, 71 A.3d 1218 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Language of the parentage statute is not ambiguous, and expressly limits the court's authority to establish parentage pursuant to subchapter 3A of chapter 5 of Title 15 to cases "where parentage has not been previously determined" in one of the listed ways. Columbia v. Lawton, 193 Vt. 165, 71 A.3d 1218 (2013).

         3. Particular cases.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Because the presumptive legal determination of parentage created by a Voluntary Acknowledgement of Paternity executed by defendant and the mother remained in effect at the time defendant filed his action to establish parentage, defendant lacked standing to bring that action. McGee v. Gonyo, 201 Vt. 216, 140 A.3d 162 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if plaintiff, who sought to establish paternity after the mother and her partner had already been determined to be the child's legal parents, were found by genetic testing to be the child's biological father, he would not have a constitutionally protected parental interest that trumped the parentage statute's bar against subsequent parentage cases. Plaintiff did not seek to establish a legal tie to the minor child until more than two years after the child's birth; he never had any significant custodial, personal, or financial relationship with the minor child; and he had ample opportunity to formally declare and pursue his assertion of parentage through a voluntary acknowledgment of parentage or a parentage action in court. Columbia v. Lawton, 193 Vt. 165, 71 A.3d 1218 (2013).

       <p>
        When the mother and defendant acknowledged that they filed a Voluntary Acknowledgment of Paternity form with the knowledge that defendant was not the child's biological father, and the mother conceded that until recently the actual biological father did not even know the child existed, this was a fraud on the court, depriving the interested parties, including the child, the biological father, and the State as parens patriae of their day in court.

        Chronic and incurable syphilis, which renders the wife incapable of bearing healthy children and which makes it impossible for the husband to have sexual intercourse with her without great danger of infection, is such physical incapacity as will afford a ground for annulling the marriage.

     <p>
      A civil marriage may be annulled during the lifetime of the parties, or one of them, on the ground that the consent of one of the parties was obtained by force or fraud, or the threat of force, or other forms of coercion or deception on the complaint of the party whose consent was so obtained or of the parent or guardian of such party or of some relative interested to contest the validity of the marriage. When such proceedings have been commenced and the party whose consent was so obtained dies before final decree, a parent or relative interested to contest the validity of the civil marriage may enter and prosecute such complaint.

        If the wife, at the time of contracting the marriage relation, conceals from her husband the fact that she has chronic and incurable syphilis, it will amount to a fraud for which the marriage may be annulled. Ryder v. Ryder, 66 Vt. 158, 28 A. 1029 (1894).
       </p>
       <p>
        Marriage was annulled on the ground of fraud, where it appeared that the marriage brought about by the authorities of the town to which she was chargeable as a pauper, by their hiring the petitionee, whose settlement was in a different town, to consent to the form of a marriage without afterwards fulfilling or intending to fulfill its obligations, and with no other object except to impose upon the town of his settlement the expense of the petitioner's maintenance.

       <p>
        "Voluntary" as used in this section is not restricted to its ordinary meaning of "willingly" and "without compulsion," but in addition embraces the element of knowledge of essential facts, hence, in an action to annul a marriage for fraud where it appeared that the petitioner after marriage had lived and cohabited with his wife for about five months, without knowledge of the fact that she was pregnant as a result of relations with another man prior to the marriage, and ceased to live and cohabit with her as soon as he learned the fact, petitioner's cohabitation was not "voluntary" in a legal sense. Sweeney v. Sweeney, 96 Vt. 196, 118 A. 882 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the trial court, after finding that the parties had "voluntarily cohabited and lived together as husband and wife for a period of about five months," made a decree annulling the marriage for fraud, under the provisions of this section, the word "voluntarily" was manifestly used in the finding in its ordinary, and not in its statutory, sense.

         The libelant having married the libelee after he had been convicted of murder in the second degree, but while his case was pending in the supreme court on exceptions, a divorce will not be given upon the ground of his subsequent sentence to the state prison for life.

          3. Intolerable severity.
         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         Intolerable severity may be established by proof of any line of misconduct persisted in by the offending spouse to such an extent as to cause or threaten injury to the life, limb or health of the other, and it is not necessary that such injury, actual or threatened, should be the direct result of such misconduct; it is sufficient if it is produced by grief, worry or mental distress occasioned by the misconduct. Davis v. Davis, 128 Vt. 495, 266 A.2d 466 (1970).
        </p>
        <p>
         The well-established rule in this jurisdiction is that to constitute intolerable severity the acts and conduct of the offending spouse must be of such aggravated nature that the health of the innocent spouse is threatened to the point of present and imminent danger. Winslow v. Winslow, 127 Vt. 428, 251 A.2d 419 (1969).
        </p>
        <p>
         The critical question in determining whether libelant is entitled to divorce on the grounds of intolerable severity is whether there was any misconduct on the part of the libelee and, if so, did it cause or threaten injury to the life, limb, or health of the libelant, either as a direct result of such misconduct, or produced by grief, worry, or mental distress occasioned thereby. Winslow v. Winslow, 127 Vt. 428, 251 A.2d 419 (1969).
        </p>
        <p>
         A finding that libelant became tense, upset, nervous, had stomach pains and jumpy, fell short of showing that libelant's health was threatened to the point of present or imminent danger, and libelant was not entitled to divorce on ground of intolerable severity. Winslow v. Winslow, 127 Vt. 428, 251 A.2d 419 (1969).
        </p>
        <p>
         To overcome the failure of the trial court to make a determination of an actual or threatened impairment of health favorable to the libelant, the facts and circumstances must be so decisive of such danger to libelant's health that there can be no difference of opinion that such result will ensue. Winslow v. Winslow, 127 Vt. 428, 251 A.2d 419 (1969).
        </p>
        <p>
         Continuing misconduct of husband producing physical harm, grief and anguish to the point of wife's physical and mental health, consisting of husband's indiscretions with other women and severely striking wife twice during arguments over husband's attention to other women, constituted adequate cause for granting wife a divorce on the ground of intolerable severity. Lafko v. Lafko, 127 Vt. 609, 256 A.2d 166 (1969).
        </p>
        <p>
         In divorce case, the weight and sufficiency of evidence is for trial court, on issues of both intolerable severity and recrimination. Tucker v. Tucker, 127 Vt. 252, 246 A.2d 707 (1968).
        </p>
        <p>
         Finding of wife's impairment of health when husband took his departure from the home with statement that he wished to live with another woman had support in evidence adduced in wife's divorce case. Tucker v. Tucker, 127 Vt. 252, 246 A.2d 707 (1968).
        </p>
        <p>
         In presence of conflicting evidence, supreme court could neither dispute trial court's finding of intolerable severity nor presume to supply a finding of recrimination. Tucker v. Tucker, 127 Vt. 252, 246 A.2d 707 (1968).
        </p>
        <p>
         Intolerable severity may be established by proof of misconduct, even if directed toward others, persisted in over the objections of libelant, which misconduct produces grief, worry or mental distress in the libelant or otherwise causes injury to the libelant's health. Pacquin v. Pacquin, 125 Vt. 243, 214 A.2d 90 (1965).
        </p>
        <p>
         Inclusion in findings that general conduct of husband and display of uncontrollable temper toward wife caused her fear of bodily harm and general impairment of health, although unsupported was not harmful error in that it was only one of several determinations which would constitute intolerable severity. Pacquin v. Pacquin, 125 Vt. 243, 214 A.2d 90 (1965).
        </p>
        <p>
         To warrant the granting of a decree of divorce on the ground of intolerable severity, it is necessary that the court make an affirmative finding that the misconduct of the libelee was such as to impair either the physical or mental health of the libelant and only when the facts and circumstances shown by the record are so decisive of actual or threatened danger to the libelant's health and that there can be no difference of opinion that such result will ensue can the appellate court overcome this failure of the issue favorable to the libelant. Crossman v. Crossman, 124 Vt. 127, 197 A.2d 818 (1963).
        </p>
        <p>
         In absence of showing that defendant was physically able to support plaintiff, his failure or neglect to do so would not constitute intolerable severity, regardless of effect it may have had on her. Beamish v. Beamish, 107 Vt. 263, 178 A. 745 (1935).
        </p>
        <p>
         When facts and circumstances are so decisive of actual or apprehended bodily harm resulting from mental suffering that there can be no difference of opinion about it, court may take judicial notice thereof; otherwise, such essential fact must be found in order to warrant decree of divorce. Souther v. Souther, 103 Vt. 48, 151 A. 504 (1930).
        </p>
        <p>
         "Intolerable severity" may be established by any line of misconduct persisted in by the offending party to such an extent as to cause injury to the life, limb, or health of the other, or to threaten, or to create a danger of, such injury; and it is not necessary that such injury, present or threatened, should be the direct result of such misconduct, but it is sufficient if it is produced by grief, worry, or mental anguish caused by such misconduct. Mathewson v. Mathewson, 81 Vt. 173, 69 A. 646 (1908); Whitehead v. Whitehead, 84 Vt. 321, 79 A. 516 (1911); Carr v. Carr, 100 Vt. 65, 135 A. 5 (1926); Crossman v.

        </h5>
        <p>
         Where the desertion had its inception while the parties resided in another state and the three consecutive years ended when the libelant was a bona fide resident of Vermont, the cause of divorce accrued when the libelant was a resident of this state. Newlin v. Newlin, 94 Vt. 26, 108 A. 516 (1920).
        </p>
        <p>
         That a wife, without physical excuse and for three consecutive years, refuses to have sexual intercourse with the husband does not entitle him to a divorce for desertion. Pratt v. Pratt, 75 Vt. 432, 56 A. 86 (1903).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where the county court found the petitionee guilty of adultery and it appeared that as the parties were leaving the place where the marriage ceremony was performed the petitioner had said to the petitionee, "You go your way and I will go mine," and had nothing to do with her afterwards, it was presumed on review that the court found the petitioner guilty of wilful desertion for three years, the contrary not appearing. Pierce v. Pierce, 70 Vt. 270, 40 A. 728 (1897).

         A divorce for wilful desertion may be granted upon a petition brought before the expiration of the three years, provided that period has fully run before the trial. Hemenway v. Hemenway, 65 Vt. 623, 27 A. 609 (1893).

         Where wife merely refused to live with her husband in a particular locality "near his relations," which he persisted in doing, her action, in the absence of proof that this was a mere simulated excuse, would be regarded as made in good faith; and if her refusal to live with him in that locality was because she believed she could not live happily there, it should not be regarded as willful. Powell v. Powell, 29 Vt. 148 (1856).

         A willful desertion must be a desertion without any good reason, or without such a reason as the party upon probable proof believes to be sufficient. Powell v. Powell, 29 Vt. 148 (1856).

         To entitle wife to divorce for nonsupport, pecuniary or physical ability of husband to support her must affirmatively appear. Beamish v. Beamish, 107 Vt. 263, 178 A. 745 (1935).

         Where husband, at time of leaving wife, leased his farm to his son-in-law upon consideration that lessee would provide lessor's wife with suitable support so far as food, heat, light, and shelter were concerned, but made no provision for her clothing or medical attention, such facts did not show that husband "grossly or wantonly and cruelly" refused or neglected to provide suitable maintenance for his wife, so as to constitute cause for divorce. Carr v. Carr, 100 Vt. 65, 135 A. 5 (1926).
        </p>
        <p>
         In order to entitle a wife to a divorce for gross or wanton and cruel failure to support, something more is required than mere desertion, though wilful, or simple neglect or refusal to support; a wife who bases her application upon this ground must establish some circumstance of indignity or aggravation characterizing the husband's conduct to bring her case with the terms of this section.

        <p>
         To warrant the granting of a divorce on the ground of living apart for more than three years, each of three essential facts must be affirmatively proved: (1) that the parties have lived apart for more than three years, (2) that the living apart was without fault on the part of the libelant, and (3) that the resumption of marital relations is not reasonably probable; it is the better practice that the trial court make direct findings on each of those points and not leave any of them to inference.

         Condonation must be voluntary to be a defense in a divorce suit, and is not effectual where induced by fraud, force or fear. Gallant v. Gallant, 129 Vt. 16, 270 A.2d 593 (1970).
        </p>
        <p>
         Intolerable severity is condoned by voluntary marital cohabitation. Gallant v. Gallant, 129 Vt. 16, 270 A.2d 593 (1970).
        </p>
        <p>
         Husband could not prevail on claim of condonation as defense to wife's suit for divorce on grounds of intolerable severity where the continuing sexual relations asserted as the basis for condonation were involuntary on wife's part and submitted to out of fear of physical reprisal. Gallant v. Gallant, 129 Vt. 16, 270 A.2d 593 (1970).
        </p>
        <p>
         Condonation is a doctrine of conditional forgiveness; it is the obligation of the offending partner to refrain from further misconduct, and the innocent partner's continuing forbearance in the hope of saving the marriage should not work a forfeiture of relief if violations of the marriage covenant persist. Lafko v. Lafko, 127 Vt. 609, 256 A.2d 166 (1969); Gallant v. Gallant, 129 Vt. 16, 270 A.2d 593 (1970).
        </p>
        <p>
         Husband, having the burden of proof on his defense of condonation in wife's cross-libel, could not claim fault in lower court's finding of no condonation where husband produced no evidence of forgiveness by his wife, either actual or by implication.

        </p>
        <p>
         Where acts constituting grounds for divorce have been condoned, but such acts have been continued after the condonation, all such prior misconduct is thereby made available as ground for divorce. Sage v. Sage, 115 Vt. 364, 61 A.2d 557 (1948).
        </p>
        <p>
         A husband's mistreatment of his wife on the last occasion of their cohabitation amounting to intolerable severity nullifies her condonation of his prior misconduct directed against her. Crossman v. Crossman, 115 Vt. 219, 55 A.2d 330 (1947).
        </p>
        <p>
         Breaches of the marriage covenant which have been condoned, with no later infraction of the implied condition thereof, are not grounds for divorce. Guibord v. Guibord, 114 Vt. 278, 44 A.2d 158 (1945).
        </p>
        <p>
         Sexual intercourse voluntarily engaged in after the libelant has warned the libelee that conditions must be changed and after a series of acts of intolerable severity constitutes condonation. Davidson v. Davidson, 111 Vt. 68, 10 A.2d 197 (1940).
        </p>
        <p>
         Intolerable severity is condoned by and the necessary promise of kindly treatment is inferred, from subsequent voluntary marital cohabitation. Davidson v. Davidson, 111 Vt. 68, 10 A.2d 197 (1940).
        </p>
        <p>
         A series of acts of intolerable severity, even though occurring at frequent intervals, cannot be said to be continuous in the sense in which infection with disease is continuous and may therefore be condoned. Davidson v. Davidson, 111 Vt. 68, 10 A.2d 197 (1940).

         Trial court's finding that separation of husband and wife exceeded six months and that the resumption of marital relations was not reasonably probable was fully supported by the evidence that the parties had lived apart for over fifteen years, both had long-term relationships with others and husband made it abundantly clear the marriage was over for him; therefore judgment granting divorce would be upheld. Zweig v. Zweig, 154 Vt. 468, 580 A.2d 939, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 942, 111 S. Ct. 350, 112 L. Ed. 2d 314 (1990).
        </p>
        <p>
         At divorce proceeding, the evidence did not support the trial court's finding that the parties had lived separate and apart, albeit under the same roof, for the requisite six-month period within the meaning of relevant statute; although the record supported a finding that they had not engaged in sexual relations in fifteen years and quality of their relationship was poor, the parties continued to sleep in the same bed, held themselves out to others as husband and wife, and engaged in activities together; therefore, remand was required for determination of whether nonsexual elements of the marriage had been abandoned. Scott v. Scott, 155 Vt. 465, 586 A.2d 1140 (1990).
        </p>
        <p>
         For purposes of six-month living apart period as grounds for divorce, parties may be deemed to be living apart if evidence establishes they live separate lives albeit under the same roof; continued residence in the same dwelling is but one factor to be considered with others in determining the nature of the relationship between the parties.

         Upon trial of a libel for divorce on the ground of adultery, letters written by the alleged particeps criminis but not known to nor received by the libelee are not admissible in evidence, although they contain a confession of guilt on his part.

         Libelee's notice of appeal from divorce decree brought the whole case, including all questions litigated in lower court and affecting the final judgment, if briefed, to supreme court for review. Mandigo v. Mandigo, 128 Vt. 446, 266 A.2d 434 (1970).

        <p>
         Determination that "none of the alleged statutory grounds for divorce were proved by credible evidence" was for trial court and could not be revised on review. Davis v. Davis, 128 Vt. 495, 266 A.2d 466 (1970).
        </p>
        <p>
         In support of a decree it will be presumed on appeal, the contrary not appearing, that all the evidence bearing upon the issues was considered by the trial court with impartial patience and adequate reflection.

        </h5>
        <p>
         Where findings of fact were waived, the court was not bound to reduce its findings to writing and place them on file, or to set forth in its order dismissing libel for divorce the material fact which was the basis for its action. Davis v. Davis, 128 Vt. 495, 266 A.2d 466 (1970).
        </p>
        <p>
         In order to support findings as to fault in divorce cases, there must be substantial and credible evidence fairly and reasonably tending to support them. Mandigo v. Mandigo, 128 Vt. 446, 266 A.2d 434 (1970).
        </p>
        <p>
         On appeal, interference with findings is justified only when contrary proof so predominates the controversy that the record establishes no reasonable basis upon which the findings can stand, and although supreme court can set the findings aside, it will not do so where the evidence conflicts merely because the evidence preponderates against them. Mandigo v. Mandigo, 128 Vt. 446, 266 A.2d 434 (1970).
        </p>
        <p>
         Though the supreme court will presume in favor of lower court's decree, it cannot supply an omitted essential fact not fairly or reasonably inferable from the facts found. Mandigo v. Mandigo, 128 Vt. 446, 266 A.2d 434 (1970).
        </p>
        <p>
         Libelant's brief pointing directly to error in findings that separation of libelant and his wife was fault of libelant sufficiently presented that question for review, contrary to contention of libelee that libelant's brief did not specifically put in issue any findings below. Krupp v. Krupp, 126 Vt. 511, 236 A.2d 653 (1967).
        </p>
        <p>
         Paragraph of finding summarizing testimony of husband and wife in divorce proceeding as to whether resumption of marital relationship was reasonably probable was not a finding and could not stand. Krupp v. Krupp, 126 Vt. 511, 236 A.2d 653 (1967).
        </p>
        <p>
         Statement in finding that court was unable to find upon any credible evidence that separation of husband and wife was fault of libelee wife was a statement that, in trier's judgment, credible evidence did not produce preponderance of evidence upon the subject for finding to be made to that effect; it did not infer that there was no evidence as wife being at fault for the separation, but did mean that there was not preponderance of evidence upon the subject sufficient for finding to be made to that effect. Krupp v. Krupp, 126 Vt. 511, 236 A.2d 653 (1967).
        </p>
        <p>
         Finding to effect that court was unable to find a preponderance of evidence that libelee wife was at fault with respect to husband and wife living apart did not serve to support judgment dismissing husband's action for divorce on ground that he had lived apart from wife for more than three consecutive years without fault on his part and that resumption of marital relations was not reasonably probable. Krupp v. Krupp, 126 Vt. 511, 236 A.2d 653 (1967).
        </p>
        <p>
         Numerous findings reciting substance of certain testimony given by one party or other were immaterial and not for consideration and were insufficient to support judgment dismissing action for divorce. Krupp v. Krupp, 126 Vt. 511, 236 A.2d 653 (1967).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where subordinate facts and legitimate findings did not support court's conclusion that separation of husband and wife was fault of husband who sought divorce on ground that he had lived apart from wife for more than three consecutive years without fault on his part and resumption of marital relations was not reasonably probable, conclusion could not stand. Krupp v. Krupp, 126 Vt. 511, 236 A.2d 653 (1967).
        </p>
        <p>
         Inclusion in the record of findings by the court without evidence to support them constitutes prejudicial error. Siebert v. Siebert, 124 Vt. 187, 200 A.2d 258 (1964).

        </h5>
        <p>
         Notwithstanding the doctrine of res judicata, an action for divorce may be brought on grounds present in the years following a prior, unsuccessful suit; where a particular ground for divorce, such as no-fault provision, requires continuous separation for a specified period of time, the court need only find that the separation has lasted for the requisite period on the date the case comes to trial. Zweig v. Zweig, 154 Vt. 468, 580 A.2d 939, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 942, 111 S. Ct. 350, 112 L. Ed. 2d 314 (1990).
        </p>
        <p>
         Vermont no-fault divorce action initiated subsequent to dismissal of divorce action brought in New York on grounds of cruelty and constructive abandonment was not barred by the doctrine of res judicata; the grounds were not identical even though New York decision mentioned "dead marriage" doctrine which could be construed as another name for no-fault irreconcilability, because under New York law the dead marriage doctrine makes up part of the grounds for cruelty and cannot stand alone as a distinct no-fault basis for dissolution of a marriage. Zweig v. Zweig, 154 Vt. 468, 580 A.2d 939, cert. denied, 498 U.S. 942, 111 S. Ct. 350, 112 L. Ed. 2d 314 (1990).
        </p>
        <p>
         Libelee, who had previously petitioned for divorce on grounds of intolerable severity and refusal to support which, after a trial on the merits, had been dismissed, could not give in evidence, or rely upon as a defense, any matter which was or might have been used in the former suit.

         There was no plain error in finding that the six-month-separation requirement had been satisfied, as the limited circumstances for finding plain error in civil cases were not present; furthermore, the mother, who was the one claiming plain error, had herself alleged that the parties were living separate and apart, and the evidence supported the trial court's finding.

        <p>
         Parties to a divorce action are permitted to negotiate for themselves the terms of their marriage dissolution. Morissette v. Morissette, 143 Vt. 52, 463 A.2d 1384 (1983).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where parties to divorce action filed a written stipulation distributing certain property and the complaint for divorce listed the same marital property as that enumerated in the stipulation, it was not error for the trial court to accept the stipulation as providing for a fair and equitable distribution of the property. Morissette v. Morissette, 143 Vt. 52, 463 A.2d 1384 (1983).
        </p>
        <p>
         In determining fair market value of wife's ownership equity in a corporation held by parties to a divorce, trial court did not err in deducting hypothetical closing costs where the parties' written stipulation filed by the parties provided for sale of the wife's shares. Morissette v. Morissette, 143 Vt. 52, 463 A.2d 1384 (1983).
        </p>
        <p>
         Vermont law permits parties to a divorce action to negotiate for themselves the terms of their marriage dissolution: thus, the supreme court recognizes the underlying right of the parties to a divorce action to contract, subject to judicial approval, and to have their agreement honored under the ordinary rules of contract.

        <p>
         In order to justify granting of petition by divorced husband for reduction of support payment ordered by divorce decree in accordance with stipulation of husband and wife permitted under this section, determination that there had been a change in circumstances in relation to parties since issuance of original divorce decree was a prerequisite. Braine v. Braine, 127 Vt. 211, 243 A.2d 797 (1968).
        </p>
        <p>
         In order to justify granting of petition by divorced husband for reduction of support payments ordered by divorce decree in accordance with stipulation of husband and wife, findings were required to show that change in circumstances in relation to parties since issuance of original divorce decree was of sufficient material substance to support amendment of decree to allow reduction. Braine v. Braine, 127 Vt. 211, 243 A.2d 797 (1968).
        </p>
        <p>
         Conclusions reached by trial court on petition to modify divorce decree to reduce support payments ordered by divorce decree in accordance with stipulation of parties, on ground of change in circumstances of parties, are not to be lightly set aside by reviewing tribunals not exposed to testimony, arguments, and explanations presented to trial court. Braine v. Braine, 127 Vt. 211, 243 A.2d 797 (1968).
        </p>
        <p>
         Courts asked to modify divorce decree to reduce support payments ordered by divorce decree in accordance with stipulation of parties should approach matter carefully, requiring a full exposition of facts and a demonstration that, because of change in circumstances of parties, original order has become unfair, unwise, or in some other way inappropriate. Braine v. Braine, 127 Vt. 211, 243 A.2d 797 (1968).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where parties enter into stipulation as to amount of allowance for support, and stipulation is incorporated in divorce decree, need for later alteration because of change in circumstances of parties should have especially explicit exposition. Braine v. Braine, 127 Vt. 211, 243 A.2d 797 (1968).
        </p>
        <p>
         In order to justify granting of petition by divorced husband for reduction of support payments ordered by divorce decree in accordance with stipulation of husband and wife, burden was on divorced husband to establish change of circumstances. Braine v. Braine, 127 Vt. 211, 243 A.2d 797 (1968).
        </p>
        <p>
         In order to justify granting of petition by divorced husband for reduction of support payments ordered by divorce decree in accordance with stipulation of husband and wife, fraud, unconscionable advantage, impossibility of performance, or hampering circumstances intervening beyond the expectation of parties may legitimately appeal to discretion of court in amending decree. Braine v. Braine, 127 Vt. 211, 243 A.2d 797 (1968).
        </p>
        <p>
         Fact that divorced wife inherited $10,000 after divorce decree which incorporated stipulation of parties concerning allowance to divorced wife for support did not entitle divorced husband to modification of provisions of divorce decree relating to allowance for support on ground of change of circumstances. Braine v. Braine, 127 Vt. 211, 243 A.2d 797 (1968).

         To the extent that the family court modified parental rights and responsibilities through a 1999 agreement of the parties, it was a valid exercise of the family court's jurisdiction; however, as an attempt to alter the parentage determination in the original divorce decree, the order was null and void because the family court lost jurisdiction to amend such determinations once the nisi period had run, absent a motion to amend the judgment. Therefore, there was no merit to a father's argument that the 1999 agreement removed the necessary predicate (parentage) upon which to base an award of college expenses. O'connell-Starkey v. Starkey, 183 Vt. 10, 944 A.2d 897 (Nov. 30, 2007).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where neither party to a divorce sought to amend the original judgment order under either V.R.C.P 60(b) or 59(e), and the judgment was not amended to reflect a stipulated agreement on parentage until more than ninety days after the original order, the amended order was a nullity. Jones v. Murphy, 172 Vt. 86, 772 A.2d 502 (2000).
        </p>
        <p>
         Provision of V.R.A.P. 4 that a timely motion to amend a judgment pursuant to V.R.C.P. 59 tolls the period for filing a notice of appeal until the motion to amend is decided could not apply to a motion to amend a divorce decree filed during the nisi period but decided by the superior court after the nisi period expired, because the court was without jurisdiction to rule on the motion after the decree became absolute. Labelle v. Labelle, 149 Vt. 660, 551 A.2d 1195 (mem.) (1988).
        </p>
        <p>
         Superior court had no jurisdiction to grant defendant's motion to reopen the record to introduce new evidence and issue an amended order after the parties' divorce decree had become absolute. Downs v. Downs, 150 Vt. 647, 549 A.2d 1382 (mem.) (1988).
        </p>
        <p>
         After the nisi period expires, a trial court's order may be changed pursuant to a V.R.C.P. 60(b) motion. Cameron v. Cameron, 150 Vt. 647, 549 A.2d 1043 (mem.) (1988).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not abuse or withhold its discretion by amending judgment and order after the nisi period had expired to correct a mistake with regard to valuation and award of certain stock. Cameron v. Cameron, 150 Vt. 647, 549 A.2d 1043 (mem.) (1988).

         Where this section required court, in granting divorce, to favorably consider woman's request that she be allowed to resume her former name unless good cause be shown to the contrary, judgment order granting divorce but making no reference to the request was insufficient.

          1. Jurisdiction.
         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         Each state, by virtue of its command over its domiciliaries and its large interest in the institution of marriage, can alter within its own borders the marriage status of the spouse domiciled there, even though the other spouse is absent. Because the court upheld the trial court's finding that the wife was domiciled in Vermont, the trial court had personal jurisdiction to grant the divorce. Conley v. Crisafulli, 188 Vt. 11, 999 A.2d 677 (2010).
        </p>
        <p>
         A finding that divorce proceedings were ex parte overcomes the presumption that the court had full jurisdiction of the parties. Walker v. Walker, 124 Vt. 172, 200 A.2d 267 (1964).
        </p>
        <p>
         This section indicates that the jurisdictional limitations of the supreme court are not altered in divorce cases. Davidson v. Davidson, 111 Vt. 24, 9 A.2d 114 (1939).
        </p>
        <p>
         Nos. 27 and 28 of the acts of the legislature for 1870 conferred jurisdiction only on the county court in cases thereinafter instituted by libel for divorce or for the annulling of marriages, and to that extent, and not beyond, the jurisdiction is taken from the supreme court.

     Legislative intent.
    </b>
    <cite class="vt-code">2011, No. 92</cite> (Adj. Sess.),
    
     §
    
    1 provides: "(a) On July 1, 2000, Vermont became the first state to provide same-sex couples the opportunity to obtain the same benefits and protections afforded by state law to married opposite-sex couples by enacting civil unions. In 2009, Vermont extended the right to establish a civil marriage to same-sex couples.
       </p>
       <p>
        "(b) Today, the United States is a patchwork of laws regarding the recognition of legally joined same-sex couples. While several states now recognize civil unions and same-sex marriage, most do not.
       </p>
       <p>
        "(c) Vermont law requires a person to have resided in Vermont for at least six months prior to filing a complaint for an annulment, divorce, or dissolution of a civil union. This long-standing rule is commonplace among the states and prevents parties from choosing a jurisdiction most likely to provide a favorable judgment. However, while an opposite-sex out-of-state couple who marries in Vermont can get divorced in the state of residence of either party, most same-sex out-of-state couples joined in a Vermont civil union or marriage do not have this option. Thus, there are many same-sex couples who established a civil union or married in Vermont who are no longer together, yet they continue to be legally bound with no recourse other than moving to Vermont and becoming residents.
       </p>
       <p>
        "(d) It is the intent of the general assembly in this act to provide access to a civil union dissolution or a divorce to nonresident couples joined in a Vermont civil union or Vermont marriage who are legally barred from dissolving the union in their state of residence, provided that the parties file a stipulation outlining an agreement executed by both parties that sets out the terms and conditions of resolution for all issues in the dissolution or divorce action. The provisions of this act pertaining to a divorce for nonresident couples shall apply to both same-sex and opposite-sex couples."

        </p>
        <p>
         The concept of residency in a divorce proceeding is encompassed within the legal definition of domicile: an abode animo manendi, a place where a person lives or has his home, to which, when absent, he intends to return and from which he has no present purpose to depart. Duval v. Duval, 149 Vt. 506, 546 A.2d 1357 (1988), overruled on other grounds, Shute v. Shute (1992) 158 Vt. 242, 607 A.2d 890.
        </p>
        <p>
         Availability of statutory remedy of divorce is closely conditioned upon meeting procedural requirements outlined in this chapter. Gerdel v. Gerdel, 132 Vt. 58, 313 A.2d 8 (1973).
        </p>
        <p>
         The two elements of domicile are residence and intention, and to make a change in domicile effective there must be a move to the new residence and dwelling there, coupled with an intention of remaining there indefinitely and neither residence alone, nor intention, without more, is enough. Walker v. Walker, 124 Vt. 172, 200 A.2d 267 (1964).
        </p>
        <p>
         Domicile, in divorce matters, is the place where a person lives or has his home, to which, when absent, he intends to return, and from which he has no present purpose to depart. Walker v. Walker, 124 Vt. 172, 200 A.2d 267 (1964).
        </p>
        <p>
         While the reason for a change in domicile will have no bearing if there is a valid intention to establish a new domicile, such purpose may well bear on the question of the validity of the intention to unconditionally assume the new domicile. Walker v. Walker, 124 Vt. 172, 200 A.2d 267 (1964).
        </p>
        <p>
         A bona fide residence under statutes in order to confer jurisdiction in divorce proceedings is within the legal meaning of domicile, that is, an abode animo manendi, a place where a person lives or has his home, to which, when absent, he intends to return and from which he has no present purpose to depart. Tower v. Tower, 120 Vt. 213, 138 A.2d 602 (1958).
        </p>
        <p>
         To constitute domicile essential to give jurisdiction of a libel for divorce, not only residence by the libelant in the county was necessary, but also an intention to remain therein. Taylor v. Taylor, 95 Vt. 94, 112 A. 355 (1921).

         It is sufficient if the libelant has her domicile in this state for the prescribed period, though she is actually living without this state. Miller v. Miller, 88 Vt. 134, 92 A. 9 (1914).

          4. Findings.
         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         Although the trial court found that a wife openly acknowledged that her sole reason for coming to Vermont was to take advantage of Vermont's no-fault divorce law, that she had family and a job in New York, and that she spent two nights per week at her mother's home in Albany after teaching exercise classes, the trial court properly held that she gave up her New York domicile and intended to remain in Vermont indefinitely. In reaching this conclusion, it relied on its findings that the wife had lived in Vermont since June 2008, had a Vermont operator's license, voted in Vermont in 2008 and 2009, paid Vermont taxes, and currently leased a residence in Vermont which she intended to renew; additionally, the wife stated that she had no current plans to move out of Vermont and had no plans to move following the divorce. Conley v. Crisafulli, 188 Vt. 11, 999 A.2d 677 (2010).
        </p>
        <p>
         Finding that both parties had lived on farm in county where suit was brought for many years prior to the bringing of the suit was sufficient to establish residence. Pacquin v. Pacquin, 125 Vt. 243, 214 A.2d 90 (1965).
        </p>
        <p>
         On the trial of a libel for divorce, the court's failure to find that the libelant had the residence within the county essential to jurisdiction of the case, was error only if the evidence was such as to entitle the libelant to such a finding as matter of law, the question being one of fact. Taylor v. Taylor, 95 Vt. 94, 112 A. 355 (1921).

         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         The identity of the wife's domicile and that of her husband, arising out of the common-law rule as to the unity of the spouses, is subject to an exception where the unit is no longer a fact because of separate residences of the spouses under hostile circumstances and there is no fault on the part of the wife.

        <p>
         Whether libelee who had left Vermont after establishing residence intended to return was not of controlling significance with respect to her right to have her cross-libel heard and determined, because when she was called upon to answer the complaint of the resident libelant, she acquired standing to maintain the cross-libel.

         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         Husband who filed a divorce complaint failed to satisfy the residency requirement. The fact that the husband, while living in Germany, surrendered his Vermont driver's license and obtained a Georgia license supported the trial court's finding that although the parties intended to return to the United States at some point, they did not intend to return specifically to Vermont; furthermore, although the husband offered evidence that the parties' relocation to Germany was not permanent, he offered no evidence that the family moved for a definite period, limited either in duration or by the occurrence of specific events.

         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         In a divorce case, the husband, a native of India, had shown domicile in Vermont when he had resided in Vermont since 2011, paid state and federal taxes, maintained continuous employment in Vermont, had a Vermont driver's license with a vehicle registered in Vermont, used a local bank account and United States-issued credit card, and made only three brief trips to India. His status as a nonimmigrant alien did not undermine this conclusion in that while in Vermont on a temporary H-1B visa, he took substantial steps toward obtaining a permanent resident visa by applying for, and receiving, his I-140 status.

         There is nothing to indicate that the Legislature intended a broader definition of "minor" in 15 V.S.A.
         §
         594(b) (testimony of child) than in
         <span class="s1">
          §
         </span>
         594(a) (representation of child), which plainly refers only to minors who are the subject of a support and custody proceeding.
    The purpose of the provision is to protect children faced with the dilemma of testifying simultaneously for one parent and against the other.
    Thus, the statute does not apply broadly to any child witness, but only to those minors who are the subject of the custody dispute. Davis v. Hunt, 167 Vt. 263, 704 A.2d 1166 (1997).

         Where court allowed attorney appointed to represent children in divorce action to make written and oral recommendation to the court as to the disposition of the child custody issue, based on attorney's independent investigation, and court adopted the recommendation verbatim in its order, acceptance of the recommendation was reversible error.

         In a divorce action, husband did not demonstrate that the court abused its discretion in declining to appoint counsel for the parties' child. Without determining whether the court was correct in finding collusion, the assumption that neither parent was thinking of the best interests of their son did not necessarily follow from such a finding. Furthermore, regardless of whether the child was foremost in the parties' thoughts, the court appointed a guardian ad litem (GAL) to protect the child's best interests, and husband did not show that the GAL failed to protect those interests. Putnam v. Putnam, 166 Vt. 108, 689 A.2d 446 (1996).

      </h3>
      <p>
       Either party or both parties to a civil marriage may apply for temporary relief at any time following the separation of the parties to the marriage coincidental with, or subsequent to the filing of complaint for absolute divorce or legal separation. The court to which the cause is returnable, or a Superior judge, on such notice to the adverse party as the court or judge directs, may make such orders pending final hearing and further order of the court as the court would be authorized to make upon final hearing. A prompt hearing will be held, and the evidence shall be recorded by a court reporter. The court or judge shall issue an order within 14 days from the date of the hearing. Failure of the court or judge to issue an order within 14 days shall not affect the validity of any order issued after the 14-day period.

         There is no necessary relationship between the abuse prevention provisions of chapter 21 of this title and the statutes and rules governing divorce proceedings. Buxton v. Buxton, 148 Vt. 22, 527 A.2d 660 (1987).
        </p>
        <p>
         Nothing in the language of the statute regarding magistrates' findings and of the statute regarding temporary relief in divorce proceedings suggests that findings or conclusions of a magistrate in a temporary order are binding upon the family court when it makes a final determination. Thus, there was no merit to a mother's argument that the trial court was bound by the findings of a temporary order. Frazer v. Olson, 200 Vt. 13, 127 A.3d 86 (2015).

          2. Separation.
         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         For purposes of temporary orders in matrimonial matters, "separation of the parties" does not mean that one of the parties must have vacated the home premises; the essential thing is not separate roofs, but separate lives. Buxton v. Buxton, 148 Vt. 22, 527 A.2d 660 (1987).
        </p>
        <p>
         Parties were separated within the meaning of this section and court had jurisdiction to issue order awarding temporary possession of the marital home to plaintiff wife where although the parties lived under the same roof, they were not living as husband and wife, divorce proceedings had commenced and the evidence indicated the existence of the kind and degree of interpersonal tension and friction necessary to justify the issuance of temporary relief. Buxton v. Buxton, 148 Vt. 22, 527 A.2d 660 (1987).

          3. Possession of marital home.
         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         Factors relevant to a court's determination of temporary possession of the marital home during divorce proceedings might include the determination as to who is to have custody of the children and what will be in their best interests as to place of residence, the emotional consequences to the parties and/or the children of continuing to share the same residence, the economic status of each party, and the cost and availability of alternative housing to each party. Buxton v. Buxton, 148 Vt. 22, 527 A.2d 660 (1987).
        </p>
        <p>
         Factors other than physical harm, fear of imminent serious physical harm and abuse to children are relevant considerations to a court's determination of temporary possession of the marital home during divorce proceedings. Buxton v. Buxton, 148 Vt. 22, 527 A.2d 660 (1987).
        </p>
        <p>
         The best interests of the children is a valid factor to consider in a final divorce order concerning award of the family home, and the same factor may be considered in rendering a temporary order. Buxton v. Buxton, 148 Vt. 22, 527 A.2d 660 (1987).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court had authority in divorce action to issue an order awarding temporary possession of the marital home to plaintiff wife in the absence of a finding either of spouse abuse under chapter 21 of this title or intolerable severity. Buxton v. Buxton, 148 Vt. 22, 527 A.2d 660 (1987).
        </p>
        <p>
         Findings in divorce action that the continued residence of both parties under the same roof was causing "considerable tension and emotional distress" which was not in the best interests of the children were sufficient to support court's order awarding temporary possession of the marital home to plaintiff wife. Buxton v. Buxton, 148 Vt. 22, 527 A.2d 660 (1987).

         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         Trial court erred in continuing the husband's temporary maintenance obligation while an appeal was pending. That obligation terminated with the entry of the final divorce order. Camara v. Camara, 188 Vt. 566, 998 A.2d 1058 (mem.) (2010).
        </p>
        <p>
         Maintenance order which calculated arrearage due from date of temporary order when final order that superseded it was held to be of no effect, but which lacked evidence that trial court knowingly exercised its discretion in establishing the effective date of the permanent award, was remanded, and since the court had offset arrearages against equity in marital home, affected property award was also remanded. Chaker v. Chaker, 155 Vt. 20, 581 A.2d 737 (1990).

         Family Court properly held the mother in contempt when instead of doing anything to ensure that the child lived with the father, the mother attempted to get the parties' older sons to intervene in the dispute, signed school forms for the child that she had no right to sign, threatened to ruin the reputations of the father and his wife in the community, told the father to "enjoy your piece of paper" when the order giving him physical custody was issued, and said that he would never come between her and her sons.

         In the adjudication of contempt, the court has the duty to exercise discretion in making a ruling. Randall v. Randall, 129 Vt. 432, 282 A.2d 794 (1971).

         The power of contempt is, in the main, discretionary, and when the court is called upon to exercise its discretion in the matter, the moving party is entitled to have the issue settled. Orr v. Orr, 122 Vt. 470, 177 A.2d 233 (1962).

         Where county court, upon finding prisoner in contempt of court for failure to make support payments provided for in divorce decree, made new order of payment for support including payments on amounts in arrears and provided that upon affidavit of noncompliance with terms of new order mittimus should issue to imprison defendant for term of not less than one year nor more than two years, and mittimus which issued granted no opportunity to prisoner to purge himself of contempt and no opportunity was given prisoner to be present with counsel to be heard on matter of noncompliance with new order, prisoner was entitled to be discharged on writ of habeas corpus.

         Where libellee reduced support payments without obtaining modification of support order, libellant could either reduce amount overdue to judgment or bring a petition for contempt. Randall v. Randall, 129 Vt. 432, 282 A.2d 794 (1971).
        </p>
        <p>
         If, in a contempt proceeding brought for failure to comply with child support order, circumstances justify penalty of imprisonment, the findings should so show, but such punishment is to be for contemptuous conduct, not merely a debt-collecting device. Randall v. Randall, 129 Vt. 432, 282 A.2d 794 (1971).
        </p>
        <p>
         Libellant should not have been found in contempt and placed under penalty of confinement unless he should pay forthwith the sum by which he had reduced child support payments without obtaining a modification of support order where findings supported his claim that he had reduced payments by one fifth because one of the five children had become self-supporting.

         The family court did not abuse its discretion in finding mother in contempt of a parent-child contact order where it found that she failed to engage in required mediation before moving out of the state, and where the court was unpersuaded by her claim that she was completely unable to comply with the order due to her financial circumstances.

         In a child support case, it was an error to order a husband's incarceration for failure to pay the purge amount. Because the family court failed to give the husband a hearing, there was no basis upon which it could find that he had the present ability to pay the purge amount, as it was required to do before he could be held in civil contempt.

         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         When a party seeks to enforce a previously rendered court order for payment of child support, the applicable provision is 15 V.S.A.
         §
         606(a), under which actions to enforce judgments by the court may be brought "at any time," as opposed to subsections (b) and (c), which establish a time limit for bringing actions on unpaid balances under the terms of divorce or separation agreements.
    "Judgments" arising under
         <span class="s1">
          §
         </span>
         606(b) are amounts owed between the parties that have not been adjudged by a court and arise automatically by law. Hixson v. Plump, 167 Vt. 202, 704 A.2d 1159 (1997).

         Since this section does not require service of the original order, nonservice does not excuse a person from liability for the payment of arrears under a child support order. Lyon v. Lyon, 143 Vt. 458, 466 A.2d 1186 (1983).

         Laches and the doctrine of equitable estoppel are not available affirmative defenses in an action brought pursuant to this section to secure enforcement of a child support order. Lyon v. Lyon, 143 Vt. 458, 466 A.2d 1186 (1983).
        </p>
        <p>
         On appeal of an order which assessed a money judgment against former husband for arrearages owed for child support payments under a divorce order where the former husband argued that the former wife was barred from recovering arrearages by her laches and/or the doctrine of equitable estoppel, since the child was not guilty of laches or acquiescence and the supreme court would not attribute any such guilt on the part of the mother to the child for whose benefit the original support award was made, the judgment would be affirmed.

         Court does not have discretion over the repayment of arrearages under a support order. Callaert v. Callaert, 156 Vt. 265, 591 A.2d 99 (1991).
        </p>

         Trial court's order relieving defendant of duty of paying accumulated support arrearages was reversed and remanded because trial court was required to render judgment for the amount due. Callaert v. Callaert, 156 Vt. 265, 591 A.2d 99 (1991).
        </p>
        <p>
         Order of the superior court on former wife's motion to enforce an order for child support contained in the parties' divorce decree which ordered the former husband to pay an amount of arrearages that was less than was due under the decree was not supported in law or fact and could not stand since this section did not grant the court such discretion.

        <p>
         Following its grant of the father's motion to modify parental rights and responsibilities and parent-child contact, the trial court did not err in denying the mother's request for attorney's fees when it found that the father could not pay the mother's attorney without liquidating his assets, that the mother might be able to pay her attorney due to her business interest, the value of which was unknown, and that the concerns which led the father to seek modification were justified and stemmed from the mother's behavior. Randall v. Hooper, - Vt.
    - , 234 A.3d 971 (Apr. 10, 2020).
        </p>
        <p>
         Following its grant of the father's motion to modify parental rights and responsibilities and parent-child contact, the trial court did not err in denying the mother's request for attorney's fees. Its factual findings were supported by the record; the mother had not challenged below the specific expenses she now stated were exaggerated; the trial court had not punished the mother for her mental health issues, but recognized that her parenting behavior was relevant to the father's actions in the proceeding; and while the trial court would have been within its discretion in awarding some suit money to the mother, it was not required to do so. Randall v. Hooper, - Vt.
    - , 234 A.3d 971 (Apr. 10, 2020).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court erred in concluding that there was no general right to attorney's fees in a divorce action and in declining to evaluate the parties' financial needs and ability to pay because, while the court has discretion in awarding attorney's fees, its misapprehension of the proper standard for evaluating such a request requires that its partial award of attorney's fees be reversed and remanded for reconsideration. Turner v. Turner, 176 Vt. 588, 844 A.2d 764 (2004).
        </p>
        <p>
         It would be abuse of discretion for trial court to award attorney's fees without knowing financial obligations and resources of parties, after finalization of property settlement and support and maintenance awards. Cleverly v. Cleverly, 151 Vt. 351, 561 A.2d 99 (1989).
        </p>

         No separate hearing need be held in cases involving child support in order to award attorney's fees pursuant to this section. Bissonette v. Gambrel, 152 Vt. 67, 564 A.2d 600 (1989).
        </p>
        <p>
         Award of attorney's fees in action under section 301 et seq. of this title was not error even though case was allegedly accepted on pro bono basis and no separate hearing was held on financial circumstances of parties, where attorneys moved for attorney's fees and court took into account evidence on financial circumstances introduced at hearing on merits.

        </h5>
        <p>
         When the family court entered judgment regarding father's arrears, including the portion to be paid to the mother and its priority to amounts owed the Office of Child Support because of previous benefits paid to her, and it was not appealed, it became a final judgment on the merits. The mother's mere act of reapplying for benefits did not undo the effect of the court's judgment, nor her rights under the judgment. Desrochers v. Desrochers, 173 Vt. 312, 795 A.2d 1171 (2001).
        </p>
        <p>
         Family court has no authority to relieve obligor spouse of duty to pay any accumulated child support arrearages. St. Hilaire v. DeBlois, 168 Vt. 445, 721 A.2d 133 (1998).
        </p>
        <p>
         A monthly child support payments order was not invalid even though the court did not enter judgment on the total amount due, as the court based its order on a prior underlying court order which had entered judgment against defendant in favor of plaintiff for a specific amount.
    Defendant's stipulation to the prior judgment, and the court's entry of that judgment, gave him clear notice of the amount he owed plaintiff, and he suffered no prejudice as a result of the payments order. Hixson v. Plump, 167 Vt. 202, 704 A.2d 1159 (1997).

         In awarding attorney's fees in divorce proceedings, consideration should be given to the parties' ability to pay. However, the family court is not required to conduct a separate hearing and take additional evidence about the relative financial positions of the parties because those positions have typically been subject to extensive judicial scrutiny during the hearing on the merits.

      The legislature finds and declares as public policy that after parents have separated or dissolved their civil marriage, it is in the best interests of their minor child to have the opportunity for maximum continuing physical and emotional contact with both parents, unless direct physical harm or significant emotional harm to the child or a parent is likely to result from such contact. The legislature further finds and declares as public policy that parents have the responsibility to provide child support, and that child support orders should reflect the true costs of raising children and approximate insofar as possible the standard of living the child would have enjoyed had the family remained intact.

       <p>
        Policy on parent-child contact does not supersede custodial parent's reasonable decision to relocate to another state. Lane v. Schenck, 158 Vt. 489, 614 A.2d 786 (1992).

         2. Visitation.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In awarding visitation, the trial court did not violate the Legislature's directive that children should have the opportunity for maximum continuing physical and emotional contact with both parents. While the mother, who was awarded three days of visitation per week, might not have as much time with the children as the father did, she had been granted ample contact, consistent with what the trial court found appropriate under all of the circumstances. LeBlanc v. LeBlanc, 197 Vt. 17, 100 A.3d 345 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly refused to order a father to take the parties' child to a gymnastics class during his visitation period; doing so did not violate the mother's right to choose the child's activities. To allow a custodial parent to schedule the child for time that was supposed to be spent with the noncustodial parent would make the contact with the noncustodial parent little more than a baby-sitting function and ignore the statutory mandate that children should continue to have the opportunity for maximum continuing physical and emotional contact with both parents; it would also bring the parties back before the trial court with an endless string of disputes over the reasonableness and value of activities. Miller v. Smith, 187 Vt. 574, 989 A.2d 537 (mem.) (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court abused its discretion by conditioning father's visitation with his children upon his payment of half of mother's attorney's fees and court costs; although order was an effective method of ensuring that father would pay mother's bills and was also a punishment for father's contempt of court's earlier order, the order was unreasonable and had no rational relationship to best interests of children. Gates v. Gates, 168 Vt. 64, 716 A.2d 794 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Visitation should function to foster beneficial relations between children and noncustodial parent, but visitation does not warrant nullification of custodial parent's reasonable decisions. Lane v. Schenck, 158 Vt. 489, 614 A.2d 786 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        While policy promoting visitation must be considered when deciding motion for modification of custody, concerns relating to it must not overshadow proper role of custodial parent. Lane v. Schenck, 158 Vt. 489, 614 A.2d 786 (1992).

         3. Purpose.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Vermont child support guidelines were adopted to ensure adequate child support orders, eliminate discrepancies in awards between children in similar circumstances and increase the efficiency of child support adjudication. Grimes v. Grimes, 159 Vt. 399, 621 A.2d 211 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        The three main purposes of Vermont child support guidelines are to (1) ensure that support orders provide the child or children of divorce the same approximate standard of living enjoyed prior to the divorce, (2) to standardize awards of similarly situated parties, and (3) to encourage parties to settle cases because of the predictability of awards. Ainsworth v. Ainsworth, 154 Vt. 103, 574 A.2d 772 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        In divorce proceeding in which mother was granted sole legal custody of children, visitation schedule which granted to father fifty percent of the children's time on weekends and vacations and approximately twenty-five percent of time overall was within policy favoring maximum continuing physical and emotional contact with both parents. Bancroft v. Bancroft, 154 Vt. 442, 578 A.2d 114 (1990).

         4. Judicial discretion.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Granting, modifying, or denying noncustodial parent's visitation is within discretion of trial court, and will not be reversed unless discretion was exercised upon unfounded considerations or to an extent clearly unreasonable upon the facts presented. Gates v. Gates, 168 Vt. 64, 716 A.2d 794 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although trial court has discretion to modify a child support obligation when the income of the parties is so great that child support guidelines do not apply, the amount of support should be based on the policy of meeting the needs of the children and having them share in family income. C.D. v. N.M., 160 Vt. 495, 631 A.2d 848 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under provision of child support guidelines that permits trial court to fashion a just support order where support order based on the guidelines would be inequitable, the legislature intended that judicial discretion be narrowly exercised so as not to undermine the goal of standardization and predictability evidence in the statutory scheme as a whole. Ainsworth v. Ainsworth, 154 Vt. 103, 574 A.2d 772 (1990).

         5. Life insurance.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The family court's order directing husband to maintain an existing life insurance policy to secure continued child support in the event of his death was proper. There is no express or implied statutory inhibition against a divorce judgment requiring a parent to maintain life insurance to secure child support. The fundamental goal of the child support statute, to protect and support the children of divorced parents to the same extent as the children of intact marriages, applies with no less force where the divorced parent dies before the children attain their majority, and the children in such a case should be afforded no less financial security. Knowles v. Thompson, 166 Vt. 414, 697 A.2d 335 (1997).

         6. Particular cases.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In its parental rights and responsibilities order, the family court clearly acted within its discretion in relying on the factors of the ability and disposition of each parent to foster a positive relationship and frequent and continuing contact with the other parent, the ability and disposition of the parents to communicate, cooperate with each other and make joint decisions concerning the children where parental rights and responsibilities were to be shared or divided, and the legislative policy that it was in the best interests of the parents' minor children to have the opportunity for maximum continuing physical and emotional contact with both parents. DeLeonardis v. Page, 188 Vt. 94, 998 A.2d 1072 (2010).

         1. Discretion of court.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The family court reviewing a child-support determination correctly decided not to require the imputation of income to stay-at-home mother for work that could be performed consistent with caring for the children; the court acted within its discretion to require consideration of actual availability of employment and the expenses involved in producing income. Tetreault v. Coon, 167 Vt. 396, 708 A.2d 571 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court does not have the discretion not to order any support obligation if the parent has gross income as defined in 15 V.S.A.
        §
        653. Hunt v. Hunt, 162 Vt. 423, 648 A.2d 843 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under child support guidelines, the trial court may find that calculating a support order based on the guidelines would be inequitable because of a parent's expenses in supporting other dependents; although the language specifically excludes from gross income other support obligations pursuant to a court order only, it would be unfair to exclude consideration of support obligations not under court order and therefore the legislature must have intended that the trial court's discretion extend to consideration of such obligations. Ainsworth v. Ainsworth, 154 Vt. 103, 574 A.2d 772 (1990).

         2. Income.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Magistrate properly declined to perform the alternate calculation advocated by a father in his request for child-support modification, based on the clear and unambiguous statutory terms regarding the calculation of available income by use of state and federal income taxes using the standard deduction, single filing status, and one exemption. Merchant v. Merchant, 199 Vt. 406, 124 A.3d 443 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate's findings regarding the calculation of a father's income in his child-support modification proceeding were supported by the evidence regarding the father's businesses, his seasonal work based on pay stubs, and the tax return from the father's new business. Merchant v. Merchant, 199 Vt. 406, 124 A.3d 443 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Income is meant to reflect each parent's actual capacity to pay child support. Both the terms "available" and "actual" indicate that the Legislature intended for the child-support calculation to be based on income that is actually being received by the parent at that point in time; to use income remote in time would not promote the legislative policy of approximating the standard of living that would have been experienced by the family if intact and would not be "actual" or "available" income. Patnode v. Urette, 199 Vt. 306, 124 A.3d 430 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        To the extent proceeds from a 2008 sale of real property were reinvested in the father's company and converted to assets, there was no basis under the child support statute to impute prospective income from the proceeds because they were invested in income-producing assets, the income from which was already part of the father's gross income. Patnode v. Urette, 199 Vt. 306, 124 A.3d 430 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        When defendant in a child support case worked as a paraprofessional and custodian at the children's private school in order to obtain a tuition benefit, it was error to include the benefit in her gross income. The benefit was not gross income because it did not reduce defendant's personal living expenses. Kelly-Whitney v. Kelly-Whitney, 189 Vt. 572, 15 A.3d 138 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that tuition is an expense item for those families who voluntarily choose to pay private school tuition does not convert an employer's tuition credit into an item that reduces necessary personal living expenses. To construe an employer's tuition benefit that has no impact on gross income and may be used or not, at the employee's election, as a personal living expense is inconsistent with fairly allocating the children's actual living expenses between the parents. Kelly-Whitney v. Kelly-Whitney, 189 Vt. 572, 15 A.3d 138 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        The amount of any social security disability payments received directly by the children must first be added to father's income, and then be treated as child support payments to the children, creating a credit against father's child support obligation. Cantin v. Young, 171 Vt. 659, 770 A.2d 449 (mem.) (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a divorce action, the court was required to include, as part of husband's gross income in determining his child support obligation, the "mortgage" payments that husband was required to pay wife, which represented one-half of the net value of the parties' commercial real estate. Under the child support statute, "gross income" includes the gross receipts of a closely held business operation, minus ordinary and necessary business expenses, and although wife held a mortgage on the real estate, the mortgage payments were part of the property settlement and could not be considered business expenses. The child support statute requires that all of the parents' income be accounted for first in calculating support under the guidelines before any deviation from the guidelines is permitted. Tracey v. Gaboriault, 166 Vt. 269, 691 A.2d 1056 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although defendant contended that the court erred in failing to consider the fair rental value of subject property, in which plaintiff and son resided, when calculating plaintiff's gross income, the record of the proceedings before the magistrate did not support the argument because the magistrate found that equitable title to the property was disputed and that plaintiff purchased the property originally, and deeded her interest to defendant in order to qualify for federal housing benefits; and, despite findings indicating that defendant's claim to equitable ownership was uncertain, the court in effect credited defendant with a $300-per-month share of the fair rental value of the property, computing the maintenance supplement at $250 if plaintiff remained in the house and $550 if she did not. Fiske v. Boudreau, 164 Vt. 263, 668 A.2d 1285 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining child support, income generally would not include proceeds from sale of an asset. McCormick v. McCormick, 159 Vt. 472, 621 A.2d 238 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        While capital gains are considered income for purposes of determining child support, amounts received in exchange for an asset are not. McCormick v. McCormick, 159 Vt. 472, 621 A.2d 238 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        For purposes of child support, capital gains does not include all capital gains realized for federal income tax purposes, but only those actually realized following the property division. Mabee v. Mabee, 159 Vt. 282, 617 A.2d 162 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred when it modified man's child support obligation based on an increase in his income due to capital gains realized in sale of property he received pursuant to a divorce decree, where property was awarded based on its then-present value, meaning that any capital gain resulting from pre-property-division value appreciation was an asset, not income. Mabee v. Mabee, 159 Vt. 282, 617 A.2d 162 (1992).

        Evidence sufficiently substantiated the actual cost of child care, as reported by a mother and accepted by the magistrate in a father's child-support modification proceeding, despite that the mother did not provide receipts substantiating her testimony that she paid the child-care costs identified in her testimony.

       </p>
       <p>
        "Extraordinary expenses" are included within statutory definition of "basic support obligation," but only extraordinary education expenses are included, and private school tuition does not typically fall within this definition. McCormick v. McCormick, 159 Vt. 472, 621 A.2d 238 (1992).

       § 654. Support guideline.
       <br/>
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Secretary of Human Services shall prescribe by rule a guideline for child support that reflects the percent of combined available income that parents living in the same household in Vermont ordinarily spend on their children.
    The rule shall be based on the concept that children should receive the same proportion of parental income after separation or divorce of their parents as they would receive if their parents were living together in one household.
    The rule shall be based on the financial needs of Vermont children, established by such reliable data as most accurately reflect their needs.
    The amounts of child support determined under the guideline shall be expressed in dollars and shall be presumed to be the total support obligation of parents.
    The Secretary may amend the guideline from time to time as may be necessary, but not less than once every four years.
    The Secretary shall also prepare and make available forms suitable for calculating amounts payable under this section.

        Child support guidelines are the appropriate tools for calculating child support obligations when modifying a divorce stipulation or final order. Adamson v. Dodge, 174 Vt. 311, 816 A.2d 455 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        The guidelines were designed to ensure that children receive the same proportion of parental income after separation/divorce as they would have received if parents had remained together, to eliminate discrepancies in awards between children in similar circumstances, and to improve efficiency of child support adjudication. Adamson v. Dodge, 174 Vt. 311, 816 A.2d 455 (2002).

        Vermont child support guidelines are embodied in tables, promulgated by the secretary of human services, reflecting the percentage of the combined parental income that should be spent on the children and an allocation between the parents for the payment of that amount.

       </h5>
       <p>
        In a divorce action, the court was required to include, as part of husband's gross income in determining his child support obligation, the "mortgage" payments that husband was required to pay wife, which represented one-half of the net value of the parties' commercial real estate. Under the child support statute, 15 V.S.A.
        §
        653(5)(D), "gross income" includes the gross receipts of a closely held business operation, minus ordinary and necessary business expenses, and although wife held a mortgage on the real estate, the mortgage payments were part of the property settlement and could not be considered business expenses. The child support statute requires that all of the parents' income be accounted for first in calculating support under the guidelines before any deviation from the guidelines is permitted. Tracey v. Gaboriault, 166 Vt. 269, 691 A.2d 1056 (1997).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The family court's order directing husband to maintain an existing life insurance policy to secure continued child support in the event of his death was proper. There is no express or implied statutory inhibition against a divorce judgment requiring a parent to maintain life insurance to secure child support. The fundamental goal of the child support statute, to protect and support the children of divorced parents to the same extent as the children of intact marriages, applies with no less force where the divorced parent dies before the children attain their majority, and the children in such a case should be afforded no less financial security. Knowles v. Thompson, 166 Vt. 414, 697 A.2d 335 (1997).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Consistent with the purposes of the Vermont child support guidelines, the legislature has required the court to review any parental agreement on child support for adequacy in relation to the guidelines. Grimes v. Grimes, 159 Vt. 399, 621 A.2d 211 (1992).

         2. Guidelines.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Guidelines calculation is presumed to reflect the amount of child support needed, and is unquestionably an important factor in the overall child support order even in the case of an order deviating from the guidelines. It is not a bursting bubble that ceases to have significance once a court deviates. LaMothe v. LeBlanc, 193 Vt. 399, 70 A.3d 977 (2013).

       Except in situations where there is shared or split physical custody, the total child support obligation shall be divided between the parents in proportion to their respective available incomes and the noncustodial parent shall be ordered to pay, in money, his or her share of the total support obligation to the custodial parent.

If the noncustodial parent owes arrears to the custodial parent, the court shall not order the payment of arrears in an amount that, by itself or in combination with the noncustodial parent's share of the total support obligation, would reduce the noncustodial parent's income below the self-support reserve, unless the custodial parent can show good cause why the payment of arrears should be ordered despite the fact that such an order would drop the noncustodial parent's income below the self-support reserve. Such arrears shall remain the responsibility of the noncustodial parent and be subject to repayment at a time when the noncustodial parent's income is above the self-support reserve.

        Magistrate did not abuse her discretion in modifying noncustodial father's child support obligation without extrapolating from child support guidelines, after concluding that parties' available income exceeded highest income in the guidelines; statute does not require a particular methodology, and where mother was unable to support children at same standard of living they would have enjoyed had family remained intact and, even after paying maintenance and child support, father lived on more than twice as much as mother, there was no error in ordering child support that exceeded an extrapolation from the guidelines.

       </p>
       <p>
        In a divorce action, the relatively small temporary deviation from the child support guidelines fell within the court's discretion, where, during the parties' extended period of separation, defendant had no access to his interest in the marital property and did not receive the tax benefits of his ownership of the property or his support of the children, and where the parties had stipulated to the temporary payment level.

        If the available income of custodial and noncustodial parents "exceeds the uppermost levels of the support guideline," pursuant to subsection (d) of this section, trial courts have discretion to establish child support obligations, but this discretion is not boundless; courts are required to justify and explain their child support orders according to factors laid out in 15 V.S.A.
        §
        659(a), and when a court decides to deviate from the guidelines, its findings and conclusions must show it considered the specified factors as well as other relevant factors. Adamson v. Dodge, 174 Vt. 311, 816 A.2d 455 (2002).

       </p>
       <p>
        The need of the child is not the sole criterion for determining the child support obligation for an above-guideline-income case; moreover, the term "need" must be used broadly to reflect the general standard of living of the family, and the children are entitled to share in family income if it grows after the parents separate, since the children are not expected to live at a minimal level of comfort while one or more parents enjoy a luxury lifestyle.

       </h5>
       <p>
        In finding that the father had the ability to pay $50 per month toward child support arrearages, the trial court erred. The father's monthly income was $201 less than the statutory self-support reserve; furthermore, the fact that the father was making regular payments was not evidence of ability to pay, as the payments were automatically withdrawn from his Social Security disability benefits and he testified to difficulty paying for his other expenses and his reliance on a local food pantry.

       <p>
        Remand was required for the magistrate to evaluate a father's motion to modify a child support order that related solely to outstanding arrearages owed for surcharges. The magistrate made no findings that the mother had shown good cause why the payment of arrears should be ordered notwithstanding that the father's monthly income fell below the self-support reserve, nor were there findings from which one might infer good cause.

       As used in this section, "additional dependents" means any natural and adopted children and stepchildren for whom the parent has a duty of support.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c11sub3As656aol1b">
       In any proceeding to establish or modify child support, the total child support obligation for the children who are the subject of the support order shall be adjusted if a parent is also responsible for the support of additional dependents who are not the subject of the support order.
    The adjustments shall be made by calculating an amount under the guidelines to represent the support obligation for additional dependents based only upon the responsible parent's available income, without any other adjustments.
    This amount shall be subtracted from that parent's available income prior to calculating the total child support obligation based on both parents' available income as provided in section 655 of this title.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c11sub3As656aol1c">
       The adjustment for additional dependents shall not be made to the extent that it contributes to the calculation of a support order lower than a previously existing support order for the children who are the subject of the modification hearing at which the adjustment is sought.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c11sub3As656aol1d">
       A motion for modification may not be dismissed or denied solely because the adjustment for additional dependents results in an increase of child support of ten percent or less if the increase without the adjustment is greater than ten percent.

        Court had power to increase amount of child support, even though stipulation incorporated in divorce judgment provided that support at agreed amount would extend beyond majority, where there was no indication in the stipulation that the parties intended the post-majority support to be a quid pro quo for reduced amounts of support.

        Because subsection (c) refers exclusively to "the child" and requires an individual award for each child, the trial court lacked statutory authority to order father to make payments for his older daughter beyond the termination of her secondary education. Morancy v. Morancy, 173 Vt. 609, 800 A.2d 435 (mem.) (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        The noncustodial parent is not free to unilaterally terminate an unallocated child support obligation on a pro rata basis as each child turns eighteen or graduates from secondary school; the parent's proper remedy is to seek a modification of the judgment in the trial court. Morancy v. Morancy, 173 Vt. 609, 800 A.2d 435 (mem.) (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Support may be allowed to continue past the eighteenth birthday when the child is either still in school or has ceased schooling for a temporary period but intends to continue. Morancy v. Morancy, 173 Vt. 609, 800 A.2d 435 (mem.) (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where parties to New York custody decree moved to Vermont, Vermont's lower age of majority was a change of circumstances sufficient to justify modification of father's child support obligation; indeed, under Vermont law, family court had no jurisdiction to enforce child support order beyond eighteenth birthday of child or child's graduation from secondary school. Cavallari v. Martin, 169 Vt. 210, 732 A.2d 739 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Absent an agreement to the contrary, the court does not have authority to enter a support order effective beyond the later of a child's majority or termination of secondary education. Knowles v. Thompson, 166 Vt. 414, 697 A.2d 335 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court correctly concluded that it lacked authority to enter a support order effective beyond the later of a child's majority or termination of secondary education. McCormick v. McCormick, 159 Vt. 472, 621 A.2d 238 (1992).

        Proviso in subdivision (b) of this section allowing Office of Child Support to make a request for support "if a party in interest" is limited to cases in which it holds an assignment of support rights from support obligee. Cantin v. Young, 170 Vt. 563, 742 A.2d 1246 (mem.) (1999).

       <p>
        Holding that an order initially establishing child support in a divorce case may be retroactive to the date that the divorce petition is filed merely establishes the outer limit on the discretion of the trial court. The exercise of this discretion must be based on the circumstances of the parties during the period for which retroactivity could be imposed. Bergman v. Marker, 183 Vt. 68, 944 A.2d 265 (Dec. 21, 2007).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Parents do not control the initial child-support order in divorce cases. Under the support statute, a family court is required to include a child-support order as part of the adjudication of a divorce proceeding; this requirement is consistent with the general policy that parents cannot waive child support for their children. Bergman v. Marker, 183 Vt. 68, 944 A.2d 265 (Dec. 21, 2007).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Order initially establishing child support in a divorce case may be retroactive to the date that the divorce petition is filed even if there is a gap between the divorce order and the support order and/or between the divorce petition and any request of a party for a support order. Therefore, a child-support order could be retroactive to the date the divorce petition was filed, and the family court erred in holding that retroactivity could go back only to the date that the father filed his motion to establish child support. Bergman v. Marker, 183 Vt. 68, 944 A.2d 265 (Dec. 21, 2007).

       <p>
        The problem of custody of children and provision for their support involves a decision that must be entrusted to the sound discretion and perceptive sense of justice of the tribunal confronted with these issues, and the final result is not subject to revision by appellate review except where the bounds of judicial discretion have been exceeded.

        If, in a contempt proceeding brought for failure to comply with child support order, circumstances justify penalty of imprisonment, the findings should so show, but such punishment is to be for contemptuous conduct, not merely a debt-collecting device.

        Libellant should not have been found in contempt and placed under penalty of confinement unless he should pay forthwith the sum by which he had reduced child support payments without obtaining a modification of support order where findings supported his claim that he had reduced payments by one fifth because one of the five children had become self-supporting. Randall v. Randall, 129 Vt. 432, 282 A.2d 794 (1971).

       <p>
        That a support order has not been modified does not restrict a court, in which a contempt proceeding based on failure to comply with the order is brought, in its consideration of the circumstances and assessment of the penalty. Randall v. Randall, 129 Vt. 432, 282 A.2d 794 (1971).

       <p>
        In cases where a support obligation is not established from child support guidelines, trial court must consider all relevant factors, including the financial resources of the child and the financial resources of the custodial parent. C.D. v. N.M., 160 Vt. 495, 631 A.2d 848 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        In assessing the financial resources of a noncustodial parent under subdivision (a)(7) of this section, court properly decided to disregard an agreement that would have conveyed marital assets in contemplation of divorce in return for little or no consideration; such an agreement was unenforceable as a fraudulent transfer. Clayton v. Clayton, 153 Vt. 138, 569 A.2d 1077 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any difficulty that plaintiff would encounter in paying child support award because of voluntary reduction of his assets was not a proper defense or excuse for not complying with court's order. Clayton v. Clayton, 153 Vt. 138, 569 A.2d 1077 (1989).

        If the available income of custodial and noncustodial parents "exceeds the uppermost levels of the support guideline," pursuant to 15 V.S.A.
        §
        656(d), trial courts have discretion to establish child support obligations, but this discretion is not boundless; courts are required to justify and explain their child support orders according to factors laid out in subsection (a) of this section, and when a court decides to deviate from the guidelines, its findings and conclusions must show it considered the specified factors as well as other relevant factors. Adamson v. Dodge, 174 Vt. 311, 816 A.2d 455 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's child support calculations reversed and remanded for the court to determine mother and father's available income using 15 V.S.A.
        §
        653, and to make a finding on whether their combined available income falls within the child support guidelines. If their combined income is within the guidelines, the court must determine child support consistent with the guidelines. If their combined income exceeds the levels covered by the guidelines, the court must explain how it considered the factors listed in subsection (a) of this section and the principles behind the guidelines in making its award.

       </p>

         5. Discretion of court.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In a divorce action, the relatively small temporary deviation from the child support guidelines fell within the court's discretion, where, during the parties' extended period of separation, defendant had no access to his interest in the marital property and did not receive the tax benefits of his ownership of the property or his support of the children, and where the parties had stipulated to the temporary payment level. Gazo v. Gazo, 166 Vt. 434, 697 A.2d 342 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a divorce action, the court was required to include, as part of husband's gross income in determining his child support obligation, the "mortgage" payments that husband was required to pay wife, which represented one-half of the net value of the parties' commercial real estate. Under the child support statute, 15 V.S.A.
        §
        653(5)(D), "gross income" includes the gross receipts of a closely held business operation, minus ordinary and necessary business expenses, and although wife held a mortgage on the real estate, the mortgage payments were part of the property settlement and could not be considered business expenses. The child support statute requires that all of the parents' income be accounted for first in calculating support under the guidelines before any deviation from the guidelines is permitted. Tracey v. Gaboriault, 166 Vt. 269, 691 A.2d 1056 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section gives the trial court discretion to set a support level above that provided for at the highest income of the Child Support Guidelines. Smith v. Stewart, 165 Vt. 364, 684 A.2d 265 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        15 V.S.A.
        §
        659 mandates at least a nominal payment, notwithstanding the court's conclusions drawn from evidence regarding the ability to meet a regular support obligation. Hunt v. Hunt, 162 Vt. 423, 648 A.2d 843 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court's award of nominal child support to be paid by father was within its discretion where children's income exceeded their need and was almost as great as their father's income. C.D. v. N.M., 160 Vt. 495, 631 A.2d 848 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under child support guidelines, the trial court may find that calculating a support order based on the guidelines would be inequitable because of a parent's expenses in supporting other dependents; although the statutory language specifically excludes from gross income other support obligations pursuant to a court order only, it would be unfair to exclude consideration of support obligations not under court order and therefore the legislature must have intended that the trial court's discretion extend to consideration of such obligations.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Presence of additional children from a relationship subsequent to the parties' relationship did not authorize the court to deviate from child-support guidelines and reduce the support obligation of noncustodial father. Such a rationale would mean that allowing the custodial parent to stay at home to care for her children would always, under 15 V.S.A.
        §
        659(a), place an "unfair burden" on the obligor parent, thereby eliminating the policy that allows custodial parents to remain at home in certain circumstances. Tetreault v. Coon, 167 Vt. 396, 708 A.2d 571 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a trial court has found it would be inequitable to order an amount of child support based solely on the mathematical formula of child support guidelines, it must consider all relevant factors; the voluntary nature of second-family obligations and consideration of second-family income and resources are relevant factors.

       <p>
        Where father's credit card obligations were discharged when he filed for bankruptcy after the divorce and, because mother's name remained on the account, the credit card company sought repayment from her, the trial court could not reinstate discharged debt by ordering father to pay mother the entire amount in an award separate from its general maintenance and child support order. On remand, however, the court is not precluded from taking the fact that mother must pay off the debt into account in calculating father's modified child support and maintenance obligations. Adamson v. Dodge, 174 Vt. 311, 816 A.2d 455 (2002).

        The plain language of 15 V.S.A.
        §
        659 ensures flexibility in situations in which a parent cannot meet the support amount suggested in the child support guidelines, and the nonexclusive list of relevant factors would not rule out consideration of religious beliefs in fixing the amount.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in reallocating two of four dependency exemptions to mother based on her unexpected return to the workplace because the decision contradicted the court's refusal to set aside the final divorce order, under which father received all four dependency exemptions. Adamson v. Dodge, 174 Vt. 311, 816 A.2d 455 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        A court may, in a divorce action, allocate income tax dependency exemptions despite the Tax Reform Act of 1984, 26 U.S.C.
        §
        152(e)(1), which creates a presumption that the parent with custody of a child is entitled to the exemption for that child. Where the court found that both parties contributed about equally to the support of their children, it properly awarded one dependency exemption to each of the parties. Gazo v. Gazo, 166 Vt. 434, 697 A.2d 342 (1997).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court properly deviated from the guidelines and concluded that neither party should pay child support, as it was proper for the trial court to consider all of the resources available to his father and the higher standard of living at his home, and it addressed the contribution of the mother's boyfriend to her household but nonetheless concluded that she could not afford to pay child support. Lamothe v. Leblanc, 199 Vt. 448, 124 A.3d 817 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Guidelines calculation is presumed to reflect the amount of child support needed, and is unquestionably an important factor in the overall child support order even in the case of an order deviating from the guidelines. It is not a bursting bubble that ceases to have significance once a court deviates. LaMothe v. LeBlanc, 193 Vt. 399, 70 A.3d 977 (2013).

         1. Provision in order for cost of living adjustments.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        An automatic adjustment provision in an order for spousal maintenance or child support, which provides for changes in the cost of living, does not constitute an invalid modification of that order; rather, it is merely a practical means of assuring that the buying power of the original orders continues to be available. Roya v. Roya, 145 Vt. 488, 494 A.2d 132 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        When an order for child support or spousal maintenance contains an automatic adjustment provision providing for changes in the cost of living, failure to set forth a basis for arriving at the change in the cost of living is fatal, because instead of promoting judicial economy by avoiding the necessity of modification proceedings, it may instead require judicial resources to resolve how the change in the cost of living is to be determined. Roya v. Roya, 145 Vt. 488, 494 A.2d 132 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        An adequately clear order for child support or spousal maintenance which includes an automatic adjustment provision providing for changes in the cost of living should set forth a simple and workable formula which can be used each year to determine what the change in the payments will be; the formula must provide for adjustments to be made in a manner which is based on readily obtainable information, and should also provide for situations in which the payor's income does not keep pace with inflationary increases in the cost of living. Roya v. Roya, 145 Vt. 488, 494 A.2d 132 (1985).

         The obligor is presently unable to pay through no fault of his or her own.

      </li>
      <li id="t15c11sub3As660ol1ag">
       Upon motion of an obligee or the Office of Child Support, the court may set aside a judgment that arrears are judicially unenforceable based on newly discovered evidence or a showing of a real, substantial, and unanticipated change in circumstances, provided the court finds any of the following:

         1. Legislative intent.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Legislative policy is to allow modification of child support obligations to standardized norms, whatever may have been the agreement of the parties in the past. C.D. v. N.M., 160 Vt. 495, 631 A.2d 848 (1993).

         2. Application.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Modification of child support must be initiated by a motion from a party; irrespective of the interests of the child, no modification can occur without such a request. This initiation requirement is an exception to the general policy that parents cannot waive child support for their children, and it is consistent with the exception that retroactivity cannot go back before the date of the motion to modify. Bergman v. Marker, 183 Vt. 68, 944 A.2d 265 (Dec. 21, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (b) of this section provides jurisdiction to modify child support whenever an order deviates more than ten percent from the guidelines, regardless of whether the order deviated by more than ten percent at the time it went into effect or whether any actual change in circumstances had since taken place. Coyle v. Coyle, 181 Vt. 583, 925 A.2d 996 (mem.) (March 14, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Office of Child Support did not have power to pursue modification of a support order irrespective of wishes of parents. Cantin v. Young, 170 Vt. 563, 742 A.2d 1246 (mem.) (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Consideration of the interests of the children may require a reduction in a child support obligation in some circumstances. Grimes v. Grimes, 159 Vt. 399, 621 A.2d 211 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislature did not distinguish between downward and upward modifications of child support orders; the policy of uniformity of awards controls in either case. Grimes v. Grimes, 159 Vt. 399, 621 A.2d 211 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        The legislature intended this section to apply even where there had been no previous award of child support. Viskup v. Viskup, 150 Vt. 208, 552 A.2d 400 (1988).

         3. Change of circumstances.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        As a father moved for modification of child-support within three years of the order, the requirement of a real, substantial, and unanticipated change of circumstances was not waived. Merchant v. Merchant, 199 Vt. 406, 124 A.3d 443 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        As a stipulated child-support order filed contemporaneously with the parties' final divorce order included consideration of the parties' respective child-care costs in the guideline calculation, the parties did not clearly seek to stipulate that child-care costs would not be taken into account in the child-support guideline calculation. Merchant v. Merchant, 199 Vt. 406, 124 A.3d 443 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Father, as the party seeking a modification of child-support, had the burden to show a real, substantial and unanticipated change of circumstances, and the magistrate's findings that he failed to do so were not erroneous based on the evidence presented, including calculation of the father's various income sources. Merchant v. Merchant, 199 Vt. 406, 124 A.3d 443 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        The family court may modify a child support or spousal maintenance order only upon a showing of real, substantial, and unanticipated change of circumstances. A change in circumstances is a jurisdictional prerequisite to such modifications, and the burden is on the moving party to establish the requisite change. Golden v. Cooper-Ellis, 181 Vt. 359, 924 A.2d 19 (March 2, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where husband's income history showed great volatility from year to year, but on average husband earned far more than the income figure on which the court set the maintenance and child support awards, the family court acted well within its discretion to rule that husband's proffer of reduced income was more a challenge to the divorce decision than a demonstration of changed circumstances and, as a demonstration of changed circumstances, was inadequate. Golden v. Cooper-Ellis, 181 Vt. 359, 924 A.2d 19 (March 2, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        The family court properly denied husband's motion to modify his child support obligations on the basis that his eldest son made an "unanticipated permanent move to California" greatly increasing his expenses and reducing wife's expenses. The additional expenses for the child were not unanticipated and should have been shown at the divorce hearing. Golden v. Cooper-Ellis, 181 Vt. 359, 924 A.2d 19 (March 2, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under subsection (b) of this section, because the child support order mother sought to modify deviated from the guidelines by more than ten percent, the court had jurisdiction to modify the order. Clark v. Clark, 172 Vt. 351, 779 A.2d 42 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        A change in circumstances is a jurisdictional prerequisite to modification of a child support order. Harris v. Harris, 168 Vt. 13, 714 A.2d 626 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Father's bad faith in failing to use alternative-dispute-resolution procedures mandated in existing child support order constituted a change in circumstances sufficient to confer jurisdiction to modify his child support obligation. Harris v. Harris, 168 Vt. 13, 714 A.2d 626 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        A change of circumstances is a jurisdictional prerequisite to consideration of a motion to modify child support; therefore, where there was no real change in the physical custody situation of children since 1991, when divorce was ordered, the family court acted within its discretion in refusing to grant motion to modify child support filed by defendant-father. Smith v. Stewart, 165 Vt. 364, 684 A.2d 265 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        The legislature has authorized modification of child support orders where there is a "real, substantial and unanticipated change of circumstances," including where the child support amount varies more than 10% from that calculated under the guidelines, and the power to modify an order exists "whether or not the order is based upon a stipulation or agreement"; the statutes do not specify, however, whether a parental waiver of the right to seek modification pursuant to the statutory standards is effective. Grimes v. Grimes, 159 Vt. 399, 621 A.2d 211 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordinarily, in order to reach the merits of a petition to modify a child support obligation, moving party must first prove that there exists a real, substantial and unanticipated change of circumstances. Bucholt v. Bucholt, 152 Vt. 238, 566 A.2d 409 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        A voluntary reduction in income available for child support does not constitute a change in circumstances warranting modification of child support order. Isham v. Isham, 152 Vt. 637, 568 A.2d 421 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly found defendant husband in contempt for failure to pay back child support, and properly denied his motion to "annul" his child support obligations retroactively, based on finding that neither second family expenses nor loss of employment was unanticipated and that the combined income of defendant and his second wife was sufficient to meet their living expenses and allow defendant to discharge his support obligation. Isham v. Isham, 152 Vt. 637, 568 A.2d 421 (1989).

         4. Stipulations.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The fact that an original child support obligation is set by a stipulation does not affect the court's prerogative to modify the child support order. Adamson v. Dodge, 174 Vt. 311, 816 A.2d 455 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Stipulation between parents modifying child support could not conclude interests of the children, nor could it take away the court's continuing jurisdiction over child support; although the agreement represented consideration of the children's interests, recognition of a stipulation that required court to ignore extent of deviation from child support guidelines would undercut statutory policy. Grimes v. Grimes, 159 Vt. 399, 621 A.2d 211 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Stipulation of parents' waiving their right to seek modification of child support pursuant to statutory standards was ineffective, and where prior order modifying child support set the amount of the obligation to more than 10% above the guideline amount, court did not err in modifying that order. Grimes v. Grimes, 159 Vt. 399, 621 A.2d 211 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        On motion for modification, where it appeared that court had confined its inquiries to whether plaintiff had proved a "change in circumstances" pursuant to parties' stipulation incorporated in divorce judgment, and findings did not indicate whether court considered any of the evidence presented in light of factors set out in section 659 of this title, court was directed to hold new hearing. Bucholt v. Bucholt, 152 Vt. 238, 566 A.2d 409 (1989).

         5. Discretion.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Once the evidence supports a finding that statutory child support threshold has been met, trial court has discretion to determine whether it will modify a support order. C.D. v. N.M., 160 Vt. 495, 631 A.2d 848 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although trial court has discretion to modify a child support obligation when the income of the parties is so great that child support guidelines do not apply, the amount of support should be based on the policy of meeting the needs of the children and having them share in family income. C.D. v. N.M., 160 Vt. 495, 631 A.2d 848 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the income of the parties is so great that child support guidelines do not apply, trial court has discretion in determining the proper child support obligation. C.D. v. N.M., 160 Vt. 495, 631 A.2d 848 (1993).

         6. Retroactive modification.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        When the mother received a Social Security disability insurance (SSDI) derivative benefit on behalf of the parties' child through the father's own SSDI benefit and the father concurrently paid the mother child support through wage withholding, the mother had been receiving a double payment. Therefore, the trial court properly ordered her to reimburse the father for the child-support payments he made, and this was not an impermissible retroactive modification under federal or state law; furthermore, there was no merit to the mother's argument that the entirety of the SSDI derivative benefit should be treated as a gratuity. Rathbone v. Corse, 199 Vt. 364, 124 A.3d 476 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was proper to make the revised child support order effective from September 16, 2008, because pursuant to the modification statute the date of notice was the date of filing the motion to modify. Since the father left the children with the mother in 2000, the ruling that he had to pay support commencing in 2008 was neither unfair nor surprising. Pahnke v. Pahnke, 195 Vt. 394, 88 A.3d 432 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Allowing a father to credit a lump-sum Social Security Disability Insurance payment towards his child support arrearages during the time of his disability did not retroactively modify his child support obligation; instead, such a credit resulted merely in a change in the identity of the payor. The benefit that the mother received on behalf of the parties' children was a substitute for the father's income during the time he was disabled and therefore should be credited to satisfy his child support arrearages during that period. Louko v. McDonald, 189 Vt. 426, 22 A.3d 433 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Pursuant to subsection (e) of this section, modification of father's child support obligation was effective only as to his obligations after the date he filed a request for a new child support calculation. Sundstrom v. Sundstrom, 177 Vt. 577, 865 A.2d 358 (mem.) (October 21, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the trial court did not offer any explanation for its choice of the date to which its child support order was made retroactive, remand of case was required for further findings of fact and reconsideration of the date upon which child support would be retroactively modified. Adamson v. Dodge, 174 Vt. 311, 816 A.2d 455 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court has no authority to relieve obligor spouse of duty to pay any accumulated child support arrearages. St. Hilaire v. DeBlois, 168 Vt. 445, 721 A.2d 133 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Husband's fraud action in superior court was an impermissible collateral attack on validity of child support order in parties' divorce judgment, a subject committed to exclusive jurisdiction of family court, and superior court was without jurisdiction to modify or annul husband's previously paid child support installments. St. Hilaire v. DeBlois, 168 Vt. 445, 721 A.2d 133 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Magistrate did not abuse her discretion by making new child support obligation effective from date mother filed her motion to modify, and then awarding over $30,000 in arrearages against father, since modification of a child support order may take effect at any time on or after filing date of motion to modify, at discretion of the trial court. Harris v. Harris, 168 Vt. 13, 714 A.2d 626 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any modification of former husband's child support obligations could not go back earlier than date of husband's petition to "annul" his support obligation. Isham v. Isham, 152 Vt. 637, 568 A.2d 421 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        A modification of a child support obligation may be ordered to take effect retroactively. Towne v. Towne, 150 Vt. 286, 552 A.2d 404 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Retroactive modification of child support payments may be allowed as of any reasonable date on or after the date of filing of a motion to amend the support order, within the sound discretion of the trial court. Towne v. Towne, 150 Vt. 286, 552 A.2d 404 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Modification of child support orders may be made retroactive to the date of filing of the motion seeking modification, at the discretion of the trial court. Viskup v. Viskup, 150 Vt. 208, 552 A.2d 400 (1988).

       <p>
        The welfare of minor children is the first consideration in considering a motion to reduce support payments to such children. Miller v. Miller, 124 Vt. 76, 197 A.2d 488 (1963). (Decided under former

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The presence of a change in circumstances is a jurisdictional prerequisite to consideration of a petition to modify a child support order. McCormick v. McCormick, 150 Vt. 431, 553 A.2d 1098 (1988). (Decided under former
        §
        651.)
       </p>
       <p>
        The loss of an anticipated employment qualifies as an unanticipated change of circumstances. Sylvia v. Sylvia, 146 Vt. 596, 508 A.2d 708 (1986). (Decided under former
        §
        651.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Changes in circumstances of either party, affecting either necessity and amount of support or change in ability to provide it, may properly be brought to attention of court at any time during minority of children by petition to modify. Beaudry v. Beaudry, 132 Vt. 53, 312 A.2d 922 (1973). (Decided under former
        §
        292.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Changes in circumstances of either party to a divorce, affecting either the necessity and amount of support, or the ability to provide it, are properly brought to the court's attention by a petition to modify. Randall v. Randall, 129 Vt. 432, 282 A.2d 794 (1971). (Decided under former
        §
        292.)
       </p>
       <p>
        To justify a modification of an order for child support there must have been a substantial change in the material circumstances since the original order was made. Miller v. Miller, 124 Vt. 76, 197 A.2d 488 (1963). (Decided under former
        §
        292.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff was unemployed at the time of the parties' divorce and trial court ordered defendant to provide rehabilitative maintenance for a two-year period in order to facilitate plaintiff's return to the workforce, plaintiff's full employment did not constitute an unanticipated and substantial change of circumstances, since it was apparent that the court fully expected plaintiff to begin full time employment within two years of the divorce order. Viskup v. Viskup, 149 Vt. 89, 539 A.2d 554 (1987). (Decided under former

         3. Discretion of court.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Once a court finds that changed circumstances are present, it has broad discretion to determine whether it will modify the child support order and the extent of the modification. McCormick v. McCormick, 150 Vt. 431, 553 A.2d 1098 (1988). (Decided under former
        §
        651.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the evidence clearly indicated that the needs of the minor children had increased since the original support order was made, a reduction of such order exceeded the bounds of judicial discretion. Miller v. Miller, 124 Vt. 76, 197 A.2d 488 (1963). (Decided under former

         4. Foreign divorce.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        While in a technical sense one state cannot directly modify a decree of a sister state relating to child support, if there is personal jurisdiction of the parties, the state may enter a new order for such support, which supersedes in that respect, the decree of the foreign state, if a substantial change in circumstances is established. Miller v. Miller, 124 Vt. 76, 197 A.2d 488 (1963). (Decided under former
        §
        557.)
       </p>
       <p>
        When divorce is granted in foreign state, and decree therein makes orders as to custody and support of minor children, such orders will be respected as res judicata in Vermont; if, however, it appears that conditions relating to custody or support have since changed, Vermont courts having jurisdiction may act in these matters in light of changed conditions, notwithstanding foreign decree. Miller v. Miller, 124 Vt. 76, 197 A.2d 488 (1963). (Decided under former

       <p>
        An unmodified support order remains in effect and cannot be modified by the unilateral action of one of the parties to the order. Forte v. Forte, 143 Vt. 518, 468 A.2d 561 (1983). (Decided under former

         6. Provision in order for cost of living adjustments.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        An automatic adjustment provision in an order for spousal maintenance or child support, which provides for changes in the cost of living, does not constitute an invalid modification of that order; rather it is merely a practical means of assuring that the buying power of the original orders continues to be available. Roya v. Roya, 145 Vt. 488, 494 A.2d 132 (1985). (Decided under former
        §
        651.)
       </p>
       <p>
        When an order for child support or spousal maintenance contains an automatic adjustment provision providing for changes in the cost of living, failure to set forth a basis for arriving at the change in the cost of living is fatal, because instead of promoting judicial economy by avoiding the necessity of modification proceedings, it may instead require judicial resources to resolve how the change in the cost of living is to be determined. Roya v. Roya, 145 Vt. 488, 494 A.2d 132 (1985). (Decided under former
        §
        651.)
       </p>
       <p>
        An adequately clear order for child support or spousal maintenance which includes an automatic adjustment provision providing for changes in the cost of living should set forth a simple and workable formula which can be used each year to determine what the change in the payments will be; the formula must provide for adjustments to be made in a manner which is based on readily obtainable information, and should also provide for situations in which the payor's income does not keep pace with inflationary increases in the cost of living. Roya v. Roya, 145 Vt. 488, 494 A.2d 132 (1985). (Decided under former
        §

        Both express terms and legislative history of maintenance supplement statute limited availability of such supplements to the custodial parent, defined as parent having custody "for the greater period of time"; family court therefore erred in awarding maintenance supplement to mother, where decree provided that parents would share custody equally.

       <p>
        Where defendant did not argue that a determination of ownership of subject property was essential to the magistrate's maintenance supplement computation and defendant enjoyed a $300 monthly credit on account of the fair rental value of the property, magistrate's determination was more than generous to defendant, based on the magistrate's findings as to who contributed to the purchase of the house and payment of the mortgage on it. Fiske v. Boudreau, 164 Vt. 263, 668 A.2d 1285 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although defendant contended that the magistrate erred in assessing a maintenance supplement in the absence of any evidence as to the cost of repairs or improvements to property in which plaintiff and son lived and although the poor condition of the house was a salient fact, the magistrate properly determined the amount of maintenance supplement under the support guidelines based on the financial circumstances of the parties as specified by 15 V.S.A.

        Although defendant distinguished the divorce situation, where there is usually a history of the standard of living experienced by the child in the intact family, from the out-of-wedlock situation, where there is no such history and urged the court to set forth a separate calculus in parentage cases, based either on the child's living standard during the parents' active relationship or on the standard experienced by the child when the parentage action is brought, defendant's theory conflicted with 15 V.S.A.
        §
        301, which mandates the same benefits for children regardless of whether the child is born during marriage or out of wedlock and, moreover, 15 V.S.A.

        661(a) directs the court to order payment of a maintenance supplement to the custodial parent to correct any disparity in the financial circumstances of the parties and does not imply a less generous standard of support where the parents' relationship was brief.

         1. Legal responsibility.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Because the family court made no findings to support its restrictions on the right of the mother, the noncustodial parent, to communicate with school and medical personnel, the court could not affirm this portion of the family court's order. Weaver v. Weaver, 207 Vt. 236, 186 A.3d 1119 (Apr. 6, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a divorce action, the family court's division of discrete legal rights and responsibilities between the parties - father having exclusive authority for health care and education, and mother having exclusive authority for, inter alia, religion and travel - satisfied the statutory requirements that "when the parents cannot agree to divide or share parental rights and responsibilities, the court shall award parental rights and responsibilities primarily or solely to one parent," as the order avoided the problems of joint decision-making while satisfying the Legislature's intent that children retain "the opportunity for maximum continuing physical and emotional contact with both parents." Shea v. Metcalf, 167 Vt. 494, 712 A.2d 887 (mem.) (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        The requirement, in a divorce decree, that plaintiff, who was awarded legal rights and responsibilities for the children, confer with defendant before making any "major decisions," was not sufficiently specific, and was broad and vague to the point that it was not enforceable. If the court was to make such an order, it had to specify the decisions involved and craft some ascertainable standard to determine when a decision was so important as to invoke the consultation requirement. Gazo v. Gazo, 166 Vt. 434, 697 A.2d 342 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a divorce action, portions of the order that prohibited plaintiff, the custodial parent, from imposing "any limitations on who the children see or what the children do when they are having parent-child contact with the Defendant" and from "exercising
    any control over the Defendant's parent-child contact," were overly broad to the extent that they interfered with the award of parental rights and responsibilities to plaintiff. Plaintiff was, pursuant to 15 V.S.A.
        §
        664(1)(A), awarded the right to control at least the "education, medical and dental care, religion and travel arrangements" of the children, subject to the order's specific provisions on travel arrangements and plaintiff's obligation to consult with defendant. Although defendant was entrusted the routine daily care and control of the child during visitation, this visitation right could not be used to nullify plaintiff's rights and responsibilities. Gazo v. Gazo, 166 Vt. 434, 697 A.2d 342 (1997).

         2. Physical custody.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Because an award of physical custody to a parent implies that the child will spend at least 50 percent of the time with that parent, the trial court's order awarding the father primary physical rights and responsibilities but the mother nearly two-thirds of the time with the child was internally inconsistent. Barrows v. Easton, 211 Vt. 354, 227 A.3d 1030 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Physical custody is not simply about the time a child spends with a parent; physical responsibility means the rights and responsibilities to provide routine daily care and control of the child subject to the right of the other parent to have contact with the child. Although the father, who had been awarded legal custody, had substantial contact with the boys, the mother, who had been awarded physical custody, was still the custodial parent and retained authority regarding the boys' routine daily care and control, even while they were in the physical company of their father. Chase v. Bowen, 183 Vt. 187, 945 A.2d 901 (Feb. 8, 2008).

         3. Activities during visitation.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court properly refused to order a father to take the parties' child to a gymnastics class during his visitation period; doing so did not violate the mother's right to choose the child's activities. To allow a custodial parent to schedule the child for time that was supposed to be spent with the noncustodial parent would make the contact with the noncustodial parent little more than a baby-sitting function and ignore the statutory mandate that children should continue to have the opportunity for maximum continuing physical and emotional contact with both parents; it would also bring the parties back before the trial court with an endless string of disputes over the reasonableness and value of activities. Miller v. Smith, 187 Vt. 574, 989 A.2d 537 (mem.) (2009).

       The State has a compelling interest in not forcing a victim of sexual assault or sexual exploitation to continue an ongoing relationship with the perpetrator of the abuse. Such continued interaction can have traumatic psychological effects on the victim, making recovery more difficult, and negatively affect the victim's ability to parent and to provide for the best interests of the child. Additionally, the State recognizes that a perpetrator may use the threat of pursuing parental rights and responsibilities to coerce a victim into not reporting or not assisting in the prosecution of the perpetrator for the sexual assault or sexual exploitation, or to harass, intimidate, or manipulate the victim.

       </h5>
       <p>
        In divorce proceeding, trial court's award of sole custody to mother was justified on basis that animosity between parents strongly dictated against joint custody and mother had been the primary nurturing parent; therefore, the court would not address whether irrebuttable statutory presumption against joint custody without agreement of the parties was unconstitutional.

       <p>
        Where parties in a parentage action were unable to agree to share or divide legal rights and responsibilities for their child, under these circumstances, this section, while not requiring an "all or nothing" approach, did not prohibit a court-ordered sharing arrangement; therefore, in light of the conclusion that the statute applies to parentage actions, and in the absence of any argument on appeal that the award of sole legal custody to mother was not in the best interests of the child, the family court's order with respect to assignment of parental rights and responsibilities was affirmed. Heffernan v. Harbeson, 177 Vt. 239, 861 A.2d 1149 (October 1, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the family court finds that there has been a real, substantial and unanticipated change of circumstances, it must consider if a change in parental responsibilities is in the children's best interests; in conducting its analysis, the court must consider the statutory factors set forth in subsection (b) of this section. Sundstrom v. Sundstrom, 177 Vt. 577, 865 A.2d 358 (mem.) (October 21, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where this section became effective after divorce action was filed, but seventeen days before the final hearing, since no pre-existing vested rights were involved and this section worked no fundamental change in the standards under which custody is considered, this section applied to the case. Myott v. Myott, 149 Vt. 573, 547 A.2d 1336 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The child custody standards of this section apply only in divorce or annulment proceedings, and not in a case where a grandparent seeks custody of a child. In re S.B.L., 150 Vt. 294, 553 A.2d 1078 (1988).

        Award of custody must be based on the best interests of the child; in determining the best interests of the child, the court must take into account all relevant evidence, including statutory factors. Cloutier v. Blowers, 172 Vt. 450, 783 A.2d 961 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Nothing in 15 V.S.A.
        §
        664(1)(A) suggests that children may determine their religious upbringing; this is a decision that belongs to the custodial parent, and thus an order allowing children's veto of their religious upbringing was inappropriate and would be stricken. Jakab v. Jakab, 163 Vt. 575, 664 A.2d 261 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is more appropriate to view this section as an amendment of former section 652 of this title, the custody statute which this section replaced, than as a new law. Myott v. Myott, 149 Vt. 573, 547 A.2d 1336 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Error in applying former section 652 of this title, the custody statute which this section replaced, was harmless where the change in the law had no impact on the outcome of the case. Myott v. Myott, 149 Vt. 573, 547 A.2d 1336 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a divorce action involving a child, the trial court must award parental rights and responsibilities to one parent when the parties cannot agree to divide or share these responsibilities or when the court determines that a parental agreement is not in the child's best interests, basing the award on the best interests of the child, considering all relevant evidence, including the enumerated statutory factors; a proper decision requires a complete and balanced analysis, comparing the relevant attributes of each parent as they relate to the best interests of the child. Gilbert v. Gilbert, 163 Vt. 549, 664 A.2d 239 (1995).

       <p>
        Because this section and section 301 of this title governing the division of parental rights and responsibilities in divorce and annulment proceedings and in parentage proceedings involve the same general subject matter where the same policy concerns apply, accordingly, there is no reason why the two statutes should not be read, consistent with rules of construction, in pari materia. Heffernan v. Harbeson, 177 Vt. 239, 861 A.2d 1149 (October 1, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although a finding that a party has been a child's primary care provider is entitled to great weight, there is no rule that the primary custodian is to be awarded custody as long as that person is fit. Payrits v. Payrits, 171 Vt. 50, 757 A.2d 469 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under subdivision (b) of this section, court is required to consider each factor listed when making a determination of parental rights and responsibilities, and subdivision imposes no specific requirement on how this consideration is to be manifested in court's findings and conclusions. Trahnstrom v. Trahnstrom, 171 Vt. 507, 756 A.2d 1242 (mem.) (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislature did not intend for courts to consider children's relationship with daycare providers in awarding custody to one parent or another. Trahnstrom v. Trahnstrom, 171 Vt. 507, 756 A.2d 1242 (mem.) (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court would not interpret custody and custodial interference statutes so as to permit existence of only one lawful custodian at any one time, since such an interpretation was in derogation of State's avowed policy of encouraging joint custody. State v. Wootten, 170 Vt. 485, 756 A.2d 1222, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 934, 121 S. Ct. 320, 148 L. Ed. 2d 257 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        In considering religion and religious practices in child custody cases, the state and federal right to free exercise of religion may be implicated; therefore, in balancing the relevant interests, the supreme court must minimize the degree of interference with religious liberty and use the least restrictive means to accomplish the legitimate objectives that warrant the interference. Varnum v. Varnum, 155 Vt. 376, 586 A.2d 1107 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order for a religious practice to be considered in determining child custody, the practice must have a direct and immediate negative impact on the physical or mental health of the child. Varnum v. Varnum, 155 Vt. 376, 586 A.2d 1107 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Consideration of the factors provided in subsection (b) of this section is not discretionary. Poulin v. Upham, 149 Vt. 24, 538 A.2d 181 (1987).

       </h5>
       <p>
        As with the decision on whether there were changed circumstances, the trial court's best-interest determination lay within its broad discretion. While the mother disagreed with the weight to be assigned to the various factors and the trial court's determination of which favored a particular parent, the appellate court could not conclude that there was an abuse of discretion in awarding legal responsibilities to the father. Wener v. Wener, 203 Vt. 582, 157 A.3d 1108 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court did not abuse its discretion in awarding father primary parental rights and responsibilities based on its findings that, considering all time periods of the marriage, the parties shared primary care of the children, and that, while many of the factors set forth in subsection (b) of this section favored neither party, three of them favored awarding father primary rights and responsibilities. Chick v. Chick, 176 Vt. 580, 844 A.2d 747 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the family court's ruling awarding custody to father reflected its reasoned judgment in light of the record evidence, therefore, its decision could not be disturbed. Porcaro v. Drop, 175 Vt. 13, 816 A.2d 1280 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court has broad discretion in awarding custody of children, and its findings will not be overturned unless clearly erroneous. Payrits v. Payrits, 171 Vt. 50, 757 A.2d 469 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court has broad discretion in a custody matter and the Supreme Court cannot set aside its decision because it would have reached a different conclusion from the facts; the trial court made an extensive review of the custody factors set out in 15 V.S.A.
        §
        665(b) in evaluating the best interests of the children, acknowledging the heavy burden on the noncustodial parent and requiring him to meet it. deBeaumont v. Goodrich, 162 Vt. 91, 644 A.2d 843 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court has broad discretion in custody matters in divorce cases; findings of fact will not be set aside unless clearly erroneous. Nickerson v. Nickerson, 158 Vt. 85, 605 A.2d 1331 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial judge has broad discretion in determining what is in the best interest of children and in many instances will be able to draw upon his own common sense, his experience in life, and the common experience of mankind and be able to reach a reasoned judgment. Bissonette v. Gambrel, 152 Vt. 67, 564 A.2d 600 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court has broad discretion in a custody matter, and supreme court must affirm unless the discretion was erroneously exercised, or exercised upon unfounded considerations or to an extent clearly unreasonable in light of the evidence. Myott v. Myott, 149 Vt. 573, 547 A.2d 1336 (1988).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Any error in a child custody case in allowing the father, a former security guard, to testify as an expert about deficiencies in a Department for Children and Families (DCF) investigation was irrelevant because evidence of DCF's substantiation of sexual abuse allegations against the father could not prove the allegations before the court. The DCF's substantiation, and whatever investigative effort it represented, constituted no actual proof of any issue to be decided by the family court. Chase v. Bowen, 183 Vt. 187, 945 A.2d 901 (Feb. 8, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        That a Department for Children and Families (DCF) investigator believed a stepdaughter who alleged that the father had sexually abused her, and not the father, was ultimately irrelevant in a child custody case since it had no tendency to make more or less probable the existence of any fact consequential to the court's determination of the best interests of the children. Even if the DCF investigator's opinion merited any weight, it remained entirely within the domain of the trial court to give more credit to the father's testimony. Chase v. Bowen, 183 Vt. 187, 945 A.2d 901 (Feb. 8, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the parties may agree to follow the custody recommendation of a jointly selected mental health expert, the court cannot be bound by that agreement or the by expert's recommendation when the evidence demonstrates that the best interests of the child requires a different result. Luce v. Cushing, 177 Vt. 600, 868 A.2d 672 (mem.) (December 2, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court's decision to exclude father's proffered evidence was not a clear and prejudicial abuse of discretion because, while the court may have relied too heavily on the parties' agreement as a basis for exclusion, it was correct in observing that the proffered material added little to an expert's report with which the court was familiar, and even if the materials in question had been admitted, they would not have affected the award of parental rights and responsibilities to mother. Luce v. Cushing, 177 Vt. 600, 868 A.2d 672 (mem.) (December 2, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, in a consolidated parentage and relief-from-abuse proceeding, mother sought to call her 13-year-old daughter as a witness to rebut father's denial that he had abused his son, the witness was competent to testify, the evidence was not cumulative, and there was no other apparent means of eliciting the same evidence, there was no sound basis for its exclusion.
    Evidence of abuse of siblings in child custody and visitation proceedings does not run afoul of V.R.E. 404(b) because the issue is not whether the parent acted in conformity with a particular character trait, but rather whether the child will have proper care and protection. Davis v. Hunt, 167 Vt. 263, 704 A.2d 1166 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a proceeding to determine child custody, the family court should use its authority to order home studies under V.R.F.P. 5, and should control the direction of the testimony in custody matters to obtain the most relevant evidence. Johnson v. Johnson, 163 Vt. 491, 659 A.2d 1149 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the trial court has broad discretion in awarding parental rights and responsibilities, it may not rest its decision entirely on improperly admitted evidence. Gilbert v. Gilbert, 163 Vt. 549, 664 A.2d 239 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a proceeding to determine child custody, parties' evidence and court's findings and conclusions should focus on the general parenting skills of the parties and the likely effect a transfer of custody might have on a child, not on a few negative incidents involving one of the parties. Johnson v. Johnson, 163 Vt. 491, 659 A.2d 1149 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        While ordinarily, given the wide discretion the court has in custody matters to determine the credibility of witnesses and the weight of evidence, the appellate court would affirm the family court's custody decision, the family court's having compared the attributes of each parent in light of the factors enumerated in 15 V.S.A.
        §
        665(b) and not relied solely on a showing that one parent's actual or expected performance was inadequate with respect to one factor, where that procedure was not followed and where there was very little evidence to support the court's findings regarding the father's ability to provide for his daughter's physical and emotional needs, the case would be remanded for a new hearing. Johnson v. Johnson, 163 Vt. 491, 659 A.2d 1149 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Religious practices may be considered in custody and visitation decisions if they have a direct and immediate negative impact on the physical and mental health of the child. Jakab v. Jakab, 163 Vt. 575, 664 A.2d 261 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a proceeding involving custody and visitation decisions, religious practices were an appropriate area for consideration where the evidence, including psychiatric opinion and Social and Rehabilitation Services intervention, supported, and the court found, direct and immediate negative impacts on the physical and mental health of the children as a result of the father's religious faith. Jakab v. Jakab, 163 Vt. 575, 664 A.2d 261 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's consideration of the factors enumerated in subsection (b) of this section requires comparison of the attributes of each parent for the enumerated qualities and cannot be decided solely upon a showing that the other parent's actual or expected performance with respect to that factor is inadequate. Bissonette v. Gambrel, 152 Vt. 67, 564 A.2d 600 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Award of custody premised, in part, on wife's misconduct was abuse of discretion where there was no support for determination that wife's extramarital affair had adverse impact on best interests of children. Hansen v. Hansen, 151 Vt. 506, 562 A.2d 1051 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under V.R.E. 103(a)(1), a party must object to the admission of evidence under subsection (a) of this section in order to raise claim of error on appeal. Harris v. Harris, 149 Vt. 410, 546 A.2d 208 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        A parent cannot claim the benefit of a factor listed in subsection (b) of this section solely by showing that the other parent's actual or expected performance with respect to that factor is inadequate: each parent must show his or her relationship with the child in light of the statutory factors. Harris v. Harris, 149 Vt. 410, 546 A.2d 208 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in awarding custody where evidence presented on each of the factors listed in subsection (b) of this section related to only one of the parents. Harris v. Harris, 149 Vt. 410, 546 A.2d 208 (1988).
       </p>

        Evaluation of the effect that a party's sexual conduct has on the children does not require expert testimony. Harris v. Harris, 149 Vt. 410, 546 A.2d 208 (1988).

       <p>
        Where defendant's lover was present in her home enough so that the court could find him to be a person who could significantly affect the parties' children within the meaning of subdivision (b)(7) of this section, evidence of defendant's relationship with her lover was relevant and admissible under section 667(a) of this title. Harris v. Harris, 149 Vt. 410, 546 A.2d 208 (1988).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In a divorce action, the court exceeded its authority by ordering joint legal parental rights and responsibility absent consent of the parties. By enacting
        §
        666(b)(6) and (7), which requires parents who do agree to share or divide parental rights and responsibilities to nonetheless complete an agreement that addresses procedures for communicating about the child's welfare and for resolving disputes, the Legislature recognized the difficulties inherent in shared-parenting arrangements and, in light of these provisions, it seems unlikely that the Legislature intended to allow courts to force such an arrangement on parents. Cabot v. Cabot, 166 Vt. 485, 697 A.2d 644 (1997).

         8. Relationship of child with parent.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Mother failed in her claim that the trial court's conclusion that she was trying to alienate the children from their father was refuted by the simple fact that the relationship had slowly, but steadily improved because there was ample evidence showing that mother and her family repeatedly acted to prevent the children from forming a positive relationship with father - both at the time of separation and the time of trial. Bell v. Squires, 176 Vt. 557, 845 A.2d 1019 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mother failed in her claim that the trial court erred by not giving sufficient weight to her role as the children's sole caregiver because the court found that although mother and the children had a close bond, the quality of their relationship was negatively affected by mother's quick temper, her habit of negative interactions with others in front of the children, the extreme disproportion between her fears and actual circumstances, her apparent inability to draw appropriate boundaries between herself and her extended family in making decisions about her children, and her failure to focus on the children's needs as opposed to her own or those of her extended family. Bell v. Squires, 176 Vt. 557, 845 A.2d 1019 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where extensive testimony supported family court's finding that although mother was initially the primary parent, father had taken an increasingly substantial role in caring for the minor, there was no basis to disturb the court's finding that the division of responsibilities had evolved over time to become more equal between the parties. Porcaro v. Drop, 175 Vt. 13, 816 A.2d 1280 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        In applying the best-interests test, the court should focus on the best interest of the child, not the best interest of the parent; thus, to the extent that the court considered mother's best interests in making its custody determination, the court was in error. Cloutier v. Blowers, 172 Vt. 450, 783 A.2d 961 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because court's conclusion that statutory factors one, two, four, and six favored awarding custody to father was not supported by the findings, and its failure to conclude that factor nine favored mother was erroneous, award of parental rights and responsibilities required reversal and remand of the case for reconsideration of that issue. Spaulding v. Butler, 172 Vt. 467, 782 A.2d 1167 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Custody award in favor of father was reversed and remanded for reconsideration, where mother had been primary caretaker before parties' separation, father had been principal cause of children's estrangement from mother, and every other consideration rendered mother the more suitable custodian. Begins v. Begins, 168 Vt. 298, 721 A.2d 469 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court did not abuse its discretion in awarding custody of minor child to mother despite express finding that mother had undermined child's relationship with father by filing excessive and baseless abuse allegations, where court found that change of custody would be highly detrimental to child and that mother would be able to foster a healthy father/child relationship within a reasonable period of time, and court also awarded father extremely liberal visitation, resulting in nearly equal sharing of time with child. Renaud v. Renaud, 168 Vt. 306, 721 A.2d 463 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a divorce, the court erred in finding that one advantage of awarding custody to father would be "primary caretaking by a parent of the same sex, with positive gender identification consequences," contrary to 15 V.S.A.
        §
        665(c), necessitating remand to the trial court to reconsider the custody issue without regard to the sex of the child or the parents. Hubbell v. Hubbell, 167 Vt. 153, 702 A.2d 129 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a child custody dispute, the family court improperly awarded custody to the father on the grounds that, given the mother's work schedule, the child would have more total time with a parent and less time in day care if the father were awarded custody, because the court's conclusions, which declared that the mother's role as caregiver is significant and the quality of the child's relationship with the primary care provider should be given great weight unless the primary custodian is unfit, and which determined that there existed a more substantial bond between mother and son, stronger than that of son and father, militated against or failed to support a change in custodial status quo. Brennan v. Brennan, 165 Vt. 525, 685 A.2d 1104 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        The exact weight of the primary-caregiver factor depends on the quality of the relationship between the child and the custodian and on the likely effect the change of custodian would have on the child and the family; absent evidence on the likely effect of the change of custodian, the court should ordinarily find that the child should remain with the primary custodian if that parent is fit. Johnson v. Johnson, 163 Vt. 491, 659 A.2d 1149 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        A parent may not claim the benefit of a statutory factor solely by showing that the other parent's actual or expected performance with respect to that factor is inadequate; rather, parents must present evidence regarding their relationship with the child in light of the relevant statutory factors. Johnson v. Johnson, 163 Vt. 491, 659 A.2d 1149 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The quality of the child's relationship with the primary care provider, if appropriate given the child's age and development, is one of the nonexclusive statutory factors the court must consider in making a custody award; however, while the court has recognized that this factor is entitled to great weight, it has declined to adopt a rule that the primary custodian will be awarded custody as long as the parent is fit. Harris v. Harris, 162 Vt. 174, 647 A.2d 309 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        15 V.S.A.
        §
        665(b)(6) directs the court to give some weight to continuation of the primary custodian with the weight to be determined by the quality of the relationship; the court must consider whether breaking, or even loosening, the bond with the primary parent will be detrimental to the child's physical and mental well-being or to the child's need for a stable and secure environment. Harris v. Harris, 162 Vt. 174, 647 A.2d 309 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        When applying primary care provider criterion to case facts to determine custody, attention should be directed to children's needs, rather than parents' actions, and inquiry should focus on all relevant periods of child's life, not just period immediately preceding trial. Nickerson v. Nickerson, 158 Vt. 85, 605 A.2d 1331 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mere physical custody by one of two fit parents during time spouses live apart to satisfy no-fault divorce requirements should not in itself cause former primary care provider to lose that status. Nickerson v. Nickerson, 158 Vt. 85, 605 A.2d 1331 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Primary care provider criterion should be entitled to great weight unless primary custodian is unfit; however, this does not create presumption in favor of that provider, but rather allows court to give due consideration to primary custodian in evaluating child's best interests. Nickerson v. Nickerson, 158 Vt. 85, 605 A.2d 1331 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where finding that one parent is primary caretaker is supported in record, it is not error to diminish to some degree the importance of other tangible considerations. Bissonette v. Gambrel, 152 Vt. 67, 564 A.2d 600 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Award of custody to mother was not error where mother was primary care provider, despite evidence of mother's animosity and rebuff of father's participation, and evidence of father's potential parenting skills and experience with child.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court's parent-child contact order was proper when the trial court made findings regarding each of the statutory best-interests factors and provided clear and articulable reasons for structuring the contact schedule as it did. The trial court explained that it fashioned the parent-child contact order in the manner it did based on father's history of alcoholic relapses, secret drinking, and putting the child at risk while intoxicated. Lee v. Ogilbee, 208 Vt. 400, 198 A.3d 1277 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in not granting a mother more visitation time than the three days per week it did award her. The trial court sought to impose a schedule that relieved the father from providing childcare, and also allowed the mother appropriate time with the children as well as adequate time to continue to recover from her depression. LeBlanc v. LeBlanc, 197 Vt. 17, 100 A.3d 345 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no error in the family court's application of a best-interests-of-the-child standard to a father's motion to reinstate parent-child contact following a voluntary suspension of such contact due to an allegation of child sexual abuse. First, it was unclear what prejudice the father suffered as a result of the imposition of the threshold showing for modification of the visitation order; second, the language of the voluntary suspension order contemplated court action; and finally, the passage of time without any contact, coupled with the allegations of abuse and the effect such allegations had on the daughter's well-being, required the family court to reexamine what level of parent-child contact would most benefit the daughter. Desantis v. Pegues, 190 Vt. 457, 35 A.3d 152 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly refused to order a father to take the parties' child to a gymnastics class during his visitation period; doing so did not violate the mother's right to choose the child's activities. To allow a custodial parent to schedule the child for time that was supposed to be spent with the noncustodial parent would make the contact with the noncustodial parent little more than a baby-sitting function and ignore the statutory mandate that children should continue to have the opportunity for maximum continuing physical and emotional contact with both parents; it would also bring the parties back before the trial court with an endless string of disputes over the reasonableness and value of activities. Miller v. Smith, 187 Vt. 574, 989 A.2d 537 (mem.) (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Visitation order allotting two six-hour periods and no overnight visitation to father was not error where it was based on court's conclusion that extensive visitation was disruptive to child. Bissonette v. Gambrel, 152 Vt. 67, 564 A.2d 600 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where trial court found that parties' son was approximately four and one-half years old and mother had provided excellent care since the parties' separation, it did not abuse its discretion by ordering a visitation schedule less disruptive to the lifestyle the child had become accustomed to than father's proposed schedule.

         10. Findings.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        While the trial court made findings regarding the statutory best-interests factors, its analysis when determining legal parental rights and responsibilities was simply too conclusory to provide a full explanation as to how the factors were applied to the facts. This was particularly the case with aspects of legal responsibility beyond medical and dental decisions, which the trial court awarded to the mother without discussion beyond merely stating that the mother had lost confidence in the father's decision-making abilities due to his alcoholic relapses. Lee v. Ogilbee, 208 Vt. 400, 198 A.3d 1277 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        To the extent a mother argued that the family court erred by failing to discuss each of the individual statutory best-interests factors in considering the parties' cross-motions to modify parental rights and responsibilities, the court disagreed, as the plain language of the statute requires that the court "consider," but not necessarily expound upon, each of the nine statutory factors. As long as the court considers each factor, the statute imposes no specific requirement on how this consideration is to be manifested in the court's findings and conclusions; upon consideration of all of the factors and its election to render findings, the court need only make findings on those factors that inform its decision. Parker v. Parker, 191 Vt. 222, 45 A.3d 48 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly considered the mother's potential abuse of alcohol during several family conflicts as it made its decision to award her primary custody of the parties' child. Hazlett v. Toomin, 190 Vt. 563, 27 A.3d 328 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly considered the various statutory factors in determining that a mother should be awarded primary custody of the parties' child; the finding that the child had long-term ties to the mother as the primary caregiver for most of her life was sufficient to support the award, even without expressly analyzing the quality of their relationship. Hazlett v. Toomin, 190 Vt. 563, 27 A.3d 328 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case where a father was awarded legal responsibility over the parties' two children, the court rejected the mother's argument that the trial court failed to make findings on evidence favorable to her. On the contrary, the findings were very detailed and specific, and covered all the disputed issues; the findings were supported by the evidence, and there was no indication that they were based on any prejudices against the mother. Solsaa v. Solsaa, 185 Vt. 587, 969 A.2d 116 (mem.) (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mother failed in her assertion that the family court made no finding identifying the primary care giver where it found that
    mother was the primary care giver during the child's first two years of life, but this changed over time to become more equal between the parties; even though it did not state precisely whether mother remained the primary care provider or whether both parties were entitled to that label, its finding, nevertheless, plainly addressed the issue and reasonably conveyed the dynamic of the evolving family relationship as revealed through the testimony and exhibits and this was is all that was required for purposes of appellate review. Porcaro v. Drop, 175 Vt. 13, 816 A.2d 1280 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court's conclusion that statutory factor regarding "the ability and disposition of each parent to foster a positive relationship and frequent and continuing contact with the other parent" weighed in favor of awarding custody to mother was unsupported by the findings, and required reversal because its findings that mother was frustrated by father's desire to be involved in child's life, and thus made unsubstantiated allegations against father, did not support such conclusion, and, further, the court made no finding regarding father's ability and disposition to foster a positive relationship and contact with mother. Cloutier v. Blowers, 172 Vt. 450, 783 A.2d 961 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        In its consideration of the statutory factor regarding "the ability and disposition of each parent to meet the child's present and future development needs," court's finding that father's age was a negative factor was unsupported by the evidence, and its conclusion that the factor weighed in favor of awarding custody to mother was erroneous and required reversal. Cloutier v. Blowers, 172 Vt. 450, 783 A.2d 961 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court did not err in determining that both parents had been primary care providers for their children, based on its finding that both parents spent approximately equal time with the children. Payrits v. Payrits, 171 Vt. 50, 757 A.2d 469 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court did not err by granting father sole legal and physical custody of children, since evidence supported court's factual findings that parties shared custody up to time mother moved children out of state, that father was more engaged in and committed to children's lives, and that best interests of children favored their living in Vermont with their father over living in Connecticut with their mother. Hoover v. Hoover, 171 Vt. 256, 764 A.2d 1192 (2001).

       <p>
        In divorce action in which there was no dispute between the parties as to who was the primary care provider, it was not essential for the trial court to specifically state this obvious fact where record otherwise demonstrated proper consideration was given to statutory factor.

        Test for whether custody order was sufficient involves review of explanation of how trial court applied statutory criteria to facts of case; if explanation indicates that misapplication may have occurred, order is insufficient. Nickerson v. Nickerson, 158 Vt. 85, 605 A.2d 1331 (1992).

        When making a determination of parental rights and responsibilities, trial court is not required to make a specific finding on each of the factors listed in subsection (b) of this section, nor specifically address each factor; it is sufficient if the findings as a whole reflect that the court had taken the factors into consideration, insofar as they are relevant, in reaching its decision.

        While it would be preferable for a trial court making a determination of parental rights and responsibilities to structure its findings and conclusions to show the findings relevant to each factor listed in subsection (b) of this section together with a conclusion as to each fact, no specific form i required.

        In order for a trial court to state in its findings, pursuant to V.R.C.P. 52(a), the facts essential to the disposition of parental rights and responsibilities under this section, the trial court must address each of the factors listed in this section.

       <p>
        The requirement, in a divorce decree, that plaintiff, who was awarded legal rights and responsibilities for the children, confer with defendant before making any "major decisions," was not sufficiently specific, and was broad and vague to the point that it was not enforceable. If the court was to make such an order, it had to specify the decisions involved and craft some ascertainable standard to determine when a decision was so important as to invoke the consultation requirement.

        Trial court's findings supported its decision awarding custody of the parties' children to the father. The trial court recognized that this was a close case, but ultimately decided that the father, whose residence had been stable and who had extended family in the area, could offer the children more stability than the mother, who had no extended family in the area, who had moved from place to place, and who did not know where she would be living next.

        Trial court did not err in its parent-child contact award. Although the husband argued that the trial court intended to leave in place the schedule set forth in a temporary order, the trial court specifically stated that it was adopting the schedule the wife proposed at the final hearing, not the schedule set forth in the temporary order.

        Evidence supported a family court's findings that due to a mother's unreasonableness and lack of insight, as well as the father's efforts to minimize stress for the parties' daughter, the daughter's best interests were served by modifying the mother's contact with her, and summertime contact was properly limited.

        Trial court's award of primary custody to the father was supported by the evidence, which included the mother's "less than positive" conduct toward the father, her lack of interest in the father-child relationship, and the father's willingness to promote the mother-child relationship.

        Trial court did not err in awarding a father primary physical and legal rights and responsibilities for the couple's minor daughter. The trial court appropriately considered the mother's continued drug use and apparently routine decision to drive without a license; it noted the potential risk of the mother's leaving drug paraphernalia within easy reach of children and the father's discovery in the mother's partially open purse of what the father believed to be LSD; and it was appropriate for the trial court to consider the paternal grandparents' relationship with the child and their contribution to her care.

        In a divorce action, the court did not err in awarding wife sole legal and physical responsibility for the parties' child where
    wife was better able to provide the child with guidance, meet his present and future developmental needs, and apply a perspective in tune with the child's needs, and wife was the primary care provider. Putnam v. Putnam, 166 Vt. 108, 689 A.2d 446 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a divorce action, the court did not err in awarding wife sole legal and physical responsibility for the parties' child. While wife intentionally declined to maximize the time allotted to her by the temporary custody agreements, she did so because of the negative effect shared custody was having on the child and should not have been penalized for placing the mental and physical health of her child above her own self-interest.

       </p>
       <p>
        In a divorce action, the court did not err in awarding wife sole legal and physical responsibility for the parties' child, despite husband's argument that the court gave too much weight to the testimony of a clinical psychologist who recommended that wife provide primary care for the child, and not enough weight to the testimony of a day care provider who testified that husband acted like a loving father who knew his child's needs. Such weighing of evidence was well within the court's discretion. Putnam v. Putnam, 166 Vt. 108, 689 A.2d 446 (1996).

        There was no finding, and none could be made on this record, that total denial of contact with the mother was warranted and in the children's best interest. The trial court was thus bound to fulfill its statutory role by crafting a contact schedule and could not delegate this task to another agency or individual. Engel v.

       <p>
        Trial court's order providing a mother parent-child contact in three phases, with the determination to advance from one phase to another to be made by the children's treatment team, impermissibly allowed other individuals to make critical decisions regarding the mother's contact with her children without court oversight. There were two main deficiencies in the delegation order: it allowed the treatment team unchecked authority to modify the type and frequency of the mother's contact, and there were no specific, ascertainable standards governing the exercise of the treatment team's discretion.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court properly found that granting defendant's motion to modify the parenting schedule was in the child's best interests. Its finding that the child had loving and supportive relationships with both parents and that a basic schedule of reasonable time with defendant would offer an undisputed path that both parents and the child could rely and plan on was supported by the record, and the trial court stated that in applying the factors, there was no significant distinction between the parties except the ability and disposition of each parent to foster a positive relationship with the other, which plaintiff had not demonstrated. Fabiano v. Cotton, - Vt.
    - , 249 A.3d 1268 (Sept. 25, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because an award of physical custody to a parent implies that the child will spend at least 50 percent of the time with that parent, the trial court's order awarding the father primary physical rights and responsibilities but the mother nearly two-thirds of the time with the child was internally inconsistent. Barrows v. Easton, 211 Vt. 354, 227 A.3d 1030 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the trial court, having made an award of parental rights and responsibilities that was internally inconsistent, would have to fashion a new parenting plan, it would be allowed on remand to consider both its assignment of physical rights and responsibilities and its parent-child contact schedule, as the court could not discern whether the trial court would revise its parent-child contact schedule or its award of physical rights and responsibilities in light of the court's conclusion that these disparate aspects of the trial court's final order could not both stand in their current form. Barrows v. Easton, 211 Vt. 354, 227 A.3d 1030 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        In denying the father's motion to modify legal and physical parental rights and responsibilities, the trial court improperly applied the statutory best-interests factors in that it allowed the maternal grandfather's relationship with the child to permeate other best-interests factors that were limited by their plain terms to an evaluation of the parents' capacities, and it also failed to fairly account for the mother's egregious behavior toward the father and explain the basis for its belief that the mother's behavior would change going forward. Bratton v. Holland, 207 Vt. 517, 192 A.3d 1257 (May 25, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly denied a mother's motion to modify parental rights and responsibilities on the ground that transferring custody would not be in the child's best interest. While the father had tried to alienate the child from the mother, the critical factors for the trial court were the child's engagement in his local school and community and his strong bond with the father, and the trial court appeared to have essentially provided the father with a final opportunity to modify his behavior by including a strict warning about the consequences of any deviation from his testimonial promise to promote the child's reunification with the mother. Knutsen v. Cegalis, 205 Vt. 144, 172 A.3d 180 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in modifying a father's parent-child contact, as the father still had a significant amount of time with the children and the decision, which sought to lessen the number of transitions and to best accommodate the children's changing schedule now that they were in school and had outside activities, was based on appropriate considerations of the children's best interests and not motivated solely by an attempt to accommodate extracurricular activities. Kessler v. Whitaker, 204 Vt. 658, 159 A.3d 1098 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        In its best-interests analysis, the trial court did not determine that the primary-caretaker factor favored the father solely because he had physical custody of daughter at the time of the custody modification hearing, but appropriately considered the roles that both parents had played during the crucial period between the initial parenting order and the filing of the motion to modify; it noted the bond that had developed between the father and the daughter, which need not necessarily result simply from having primary custody of the child for a period of time. Clark v. Bellavance, 204 Vt. 111, 162 A.3d 679 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a custody modification case, there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's conclusion that it was in the daughter's best interests that the father have custody. The trial court found that the daughter seemed more relaxed and happy in her father's custody and that she had grown comfortable with the father as the primary caretaker; moreover, the mother's persistent belief that the father molested the daughter formed the basis for its best-interests analysis, and the trial court relied heavily on the report of an expert who found, inter alia, that the mother needed the daughter to play the role of an injured child with severe emotional problems. Clark v. Bellavance, 204 Vt. 111, 162 A.3d 679 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in denying a mother's motion to modify parental rights and responsibilities and in not allowing the mother any rights of parent-child contact until August 2016 unless the child's trauma therapist recommended contact earlier. Although the trial court recognized that the father and the stepmother had alienated the child from the mother, it credited expert testimony that the child would be at significant risk of mental health problems if efforts at reunification continued, it found that the child would experience "violent dislocation" if the mother were awarded custody, and it considered all of the statutory best-interest criteria and provided a reasoned basis for its conclusions. Knutsen v. Cegalis, 201 Vt. 138, 137 A.3d 734 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Findings supported the trial court's conclusion that the fifth statutory best-interests factor, fostering a relationship between the child and the other parent, favored the father. The trial court found that mother opposed increasing contact between the children and the father and that she opposed him discussing anything of import with the children without discussing it with her first. Frazer v. Olson, 200 Vt. 13, 127 A.3d 86 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the trial court was inconsistent in its findings under the sixth best-interests factor as to whether the mother was the primary caregiver, this discord did not affect the legal rights of the mother, who was ultimately awarded custody. Frazer v. Olson, 200 Vt. 13, 127 A.3d 86 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly awarded the mother sole parental rights and responsibilities. Regarding the father's ability to provide the child with guidance as well as his ability to meet the child's present and future developmental needs, it found that the father had deceived the mother about his professional status for five years; in relation to the quality of the child's relationship with the primary care provider, it observed that the mother had had primary responsibility for the child since the parties separated and had played a larger role in caring for the child prior to the separation. MacCormack v. MacCormack, 199 Vt. 233, 123 A.3d 383 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court did not err in concluding that the mother had made a firm decision to move and basing its custody decision in part on her anticipated relocation. Her representations to the family court from the outset of the divorce proceeding until the last day of trial indicated that she intended to leave Vermont. Paine v. Buffa, 195 Vt. 596, 93 A.3d 90 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court's decision to assign legal custody to the father was supported by its findings, which led the family court to conclude that the mother's proposed relocation would be unduly disruptive for the children. Moreover, the family court explicitly considered other factors besides the proposed relocation and found that the father was better able and disposed than the mother to foster a positive relationship and frequent and continuing contact with the other parent. Paine v. Buffa, 195 Vt. 596, 93 A.3d 90 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        In finding in a custody case that the wife engaged in a pattern of conduct to exclude the husband from interaction and contact with the child, the findings that the trial court made as to the wife's filing of a relief-from-abuse (RFA) petition were sufficient. The trial court found that there was no credible evidence of abuse, that the wife "embellished minor accidental injuries" into abuse, and that the wife did not consult with any professionals before filing the RFA petition; further, the wife's action in embellishing the evidence that did exist suggested that she knew that the facts alone without the embellishment were insufficient to show abuse. Hanson-Metayer v. Hanson-Metayer, 193 Vt. 490, 70 A.3d 1036 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a custody case, the evidence supported the trial court's conclusion that the child's support system and educational environment were stronger in Vermont than in Maryland, even though the support system in Maryland was temporarily aided by the visits of the wife's mother. The trial court could give less weight to the wife's statement that the child was doing well in her educational environment absent neutral evidence to this effect. Hanson-Metayer v. Hanson-Metayer, 193 Vt. 490, 70 A.3d 1036 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because of the active parenting of both parties, the evidence of the environment in Vermont, and the father's effort to keep physical contact with the child, the trial court in its custody decision could determine the likely effect of the change of custodian. Hanson-Metayer v. Hanson-Metayer, 193 Vt. 490, 70 A.3d 1036 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court could not reverse the trial court's custody decision because of the errors in the findings supporting its conclusion that the wife engaged in a pattern of conduct to exclude the husband from interaction and contact with the child. The majority of the findings were correct, and the decision was not controlled by the erroneous findings. Hanson-Metayer v. Hanson-Metayer, 193 Vt. 490, 70 A.3d 1036 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutory factors used in a custody determination necessarily involve a comparison, and the trial court did not err in viewing the fourth factor so. Hanson-Metayer v. Hanson-Metayer, 193 Vt. 490, 70 A.3d 1036 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        In finding in a modification of custody case that a father moved to Missouri to be near family, the family court did not err. The family court stated that its finding was supported by the credible testimony of both the father and the father's wife, and the appellate court relied on the family court's determinations of credibility and would not overturn findings if credible evidence supported them. Chickanosky v. Chickanosky, 190 Vt. 435, 35 A.3d 132 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a modification of custody case, independent evidence supported the family court's finding that the mother did not foster independence in the parties' daughter. The family court noted that the mother had a history of interfering with the daughter's schooling, that she did not allow the daughter to be alone at extracurricular activities when the father and his wife were present, and that the mother's husband testified that he believed that the mother would re-apply for a teaching position at the high school the daughter would attend if she remained in Vermont. Chickanosky v. Chickanosky, 190 Vt. 435, 35 A.3d 132 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a modification of custody case, the family court's application and analysis of the best interests of the child standard was well within its broad discretion when of the seven applicable factors, the family court concluded that four favored the father, one favored the mother, and two did not favor either parent. In its discretion, the family court concluded that the father should be awarded primary physical rights and responsibilities because this would best allow the daughter to maintain relationships with both parents and families and to develop independence and autonomy. Chickanosky v. Chickanosky, 190 Vt. 435, 35 A.3d 132 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court properly ordered a transfer of child custody when the second partner in a former civil union had been interfering with the first partner's visitation rights. The evidence supported the family court's conclusion that the first partner had been acting in the child's best interests, while the second partner had shown contempt for the law. Miller-Jenkins v. Miller-Jenkins, 189 Vt. 518, 12 A.3d 768 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        In rejecting a partner's proffered justifications for denying parent-child contact with the other partner to a former civil union, the family court properly found that the other partner's sexual orientation was irrelevant. Because same-sex couples had the same rights and responsibilities as opposite-sex couples, the sexual orientation of the parents was irrelevant in a custody determination. Miller-Jenkins v. Miller-Jenkins, 189 Vt. 518, 12 A.3d 768 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in not applying the law of relocation when the mother planned to move to California. The case was not a relocation case, but a final determination of parental rights and responsibilities following a temporary order which the parents had verbally amended as the father became increasingly involved in the child's life. Thompson v. Pafundi, 188 Vt. 605, 8 A.3d 476 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a parental rights and responsibilities case, there was no merit to the mother's argument that the trial court abused its discretion by not setting a parent-child contact schedule for the infant and the mother. In the final order, the judge specifically instructed the parties to meet and work out an appropriate schedule in light of mother's move to California; if the parties were unable to reach an agreement, the trial court indicated it would conduct a separate hearing. Thompson v. Pafundi, 188 Vt. 605, 8 A.3d 476 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        In its parental rights and responsibilities order, the family court clearly acted within its discretion in relying on the factors of the ability and disposition of each parent to foster a positive relationship and frequent and continuing contact with the other parent, the ability and disposition of the parents to communicate, cooperate with each other and make joint decisions concerning the children where parental rights and responsibilities were to be shared or divided, and the legislative policy that it was in the best interests of the parents' minor children to have the opportunity for maximum continuing physical and emotional contact with both parents. DeLeonardis v. Page, 188 Vt. 94, 998 A.2d 1072 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        In awarding custody to plaintiff, the trial court properly considered defendant's role as caregiver. Though the trial court acknowledged that defendant usually cooked for the children and bought their clothes, it found that both parents were very involved in the children's lives, shared the bedtime rituals, and took the children to their medical appointments; in addition, the trial court noted that while defendant cared for the children at night, plaintiff cared for them in the morning. DeLeonardis v. Page, 188 Vt. 94, 998 A.2d 1072 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Though the family court relied upon defendant's animosity toward plaintiff, defendant's lack of communication with plaintiff about the children, and defendant's propensity to act in a controlling manner in awarding plaintiff custody, it did so only to weigh the parties' conduct in relation to the statutory factors and whether that conduct adversely or positively affected the interests of the children. DeLeonardis v. Page, 188 Vt. 94, 998 A.2d 1072 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff's statements that the best interests of the children would be served by equal parent-child contact and her request that the court divide parent-child contact accordingly were merely part of a record that was replete with other evidence that the trial court could and did consider in determining the best interests of the children. In view of the evidence and the broad discretion afforded to the trial court, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in reaching a decision on parent-child contact different from that recommended by either of the parties. DeLeonardis v. Page, 188 Vt. 94, 998 A.2d 1072 (2010).

        Automatic change provision that shifted custody from the mother to the father on March 1, 2010, subjected any child-rearing decision made by mother to veto by father starting on March 1, 2010. The provision bred increased opportunity for animosity between the parents of the kind the legislature sought to avoid, not to mention confusion for the child. Knutsen v. Cegalis, 187 Vt. 99, 989 A.2d 1010 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Neither proceedings on appeal nor remand constituted a second suit for purposes of res judicata; thus, there was no merit to a mother's argument that the portion of a child custody award awarding her temporary custody should not be disturbed. The family court made a comprehensive ruling in which the temporary award of custody to mother was premised on the eventual, indefinite award to father; thus, there was no basis in logic for prohibiting the family court from reevaluating the entire custody award on remand, and in order to safeguard the best interests of the child, the family court had to be given the latitude to make another comprehensive order, consistent with law. Knutsen v. Cegalis, 187 Vt. 99, 989 A.2d 1010 (2009).

        Provision automatically shifting rights and responsibilities to the father six months before the child entered kindergarten was unlawful. Knutsen v. Cegalis, 187 Vt. 99, 989 A.2d 1010 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mother's contention that she was prejudiced by not receiving notice of the father's motion for sole custody was unfounded because her own motion to modify put the custody and contact order, as well as her parenting ability, in issue. Chase v. Bowen, 183 Vt. 187, 945 A.2d 901 (Feb. 8, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a custody case involving a couple's boys, there was no merit to the argument by the boys' attorney that the prohibition on the presence of young females during the father's contact with the boys was inconsistent with the evidence and with professional opinion. An investigator's belief that the father was an untreated child molester depended entirely on an accusation not proven to the family court, and the investigator described no risk to the boys other than the patently obvious concern about the parental judgment of a father who would molest his stepdaughter while his other children slept in the same room, an allegation the family court found unsupported by the evidence. Chase v. Bowen, 183 Vt. 187, 945 A.2d 901 (Feb. 8, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        In its best-interests analysis, the trial court did not err in finding that the father was more involved with the education of the parties' boys. The trial court's decision on this factor was not limited to the amount of time the father spent with the children, but focused on his demonstrated interest in the boys' education and development. Chase v. Bowen, 183 Vt. 187, 945 A.2d 901 (Feb. 8, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        To the extent that the family court modified parental rights and responsibilities through a 1999 agreement of the parties, it was a valid exercise of the family court's jurisdiction; however, as an attempt to alter the parentage determination in the original divorce decree, the order was null and void because the family court lost jurisdiction to amend such determinations once the nisi period had run, absent a motion to amend the judgment. Therefore, there was no merit to a father's argument that the 1999 agreement removed the necessary predicate (parentage) upon which to base an award of college expenses. O'connell-Starkey v. Starkey, 183 Vt. 10, 944 A.2d 897 (Nov. 30, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where evidence was sufficient to support the family court's finding that father's care of the children nearly approximated mother's in the qualitative sense, there was no basis to disturb its conclusion that mother's proposed relocation, combined with her disinclination to abide by father's interest and rights to parent-child contact, would likely erode or destroy the children's relationship with their father. Rogers v. Parrish, 181 Vt. 485, 923 A.2d 607 (May 4, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Relocation, by itself, is no basis to reassign custody; however, when combined with disruption of the children's stability and the likely substantial, if not total, loss of relationship with their father, the anticipated moves by mother were fairly considered. That repetitive relocation was required to be balanced against an arguably more stable "quality of the child's adjustment to . . . present housing, school and community," the child's established relationships with father and other significant family and friends, leavened, or not, by the parents' relationship with one another, as well as "the quality of the child's relationship with the primary care provider," are all a function of the statute and not merely the court's predilection. Likewise, the court's weighing of mother's decision to follow her husband's career at the expense of the children's relationship with their father was also a requirement of the statute's mandate to consider the relative merits of the parents' "ability and disposition . . . to meet the child's present and future developmental needs," as well as "foster a positive relationship" with the other parent. Rogers v. Parrish, 181 Vt. 485, 923 A.2d 607 (May 4, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Transfer of physical custody of the children to father was supported by the court's findings and balancing of the statutory factors. Boiled down, the court explained that after weighing the evidence and balancing the factors, father could be relied upon to maintain the children's contact with the other parent, but mother could not be relied upon to do the same. Thus, custody with father was more likely to accomplish continuing maximum contact with both parents, while maintaining custody with mother was less likely to achieve that goal considering the risk, based on history that even minimum contact with father would have withered on mother's watch. Because the court's findings, conclusions and exercise of discretion thereon were all tenable, at the least, no abuse of discretion appears. Rogers v. Parrish, 181 Vt. 485, 923 A.2d 607 (May 4, 2007).

       <p>
        In a divorce action, the family court's assessment of the factors contained in subsection (b) of this section supported its conclusion that it was in the child's best interests to remain with mother as she relocated to their native Bosnia. Osmanagic v. Osmanagic, 178 Vt. 538, 872 A.2d 897 (mem.) (March 23, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a proceeding on mother's motion to modify parental rights and responsibilities so that she could relocate to another state with the parties' minor child, where the family court found that father had demonstrated a greater ability to meet the child's developmental needs, a factor that all parties viewed as especially important for the child, and that none of the statutory factors weighed decidedly in mother's favor, the court properly exercised its discretion by concluding that the factors warranted a reallocation of primary legal and physical parental rights and responsibilities to father. Sochin v. Sochin, 178 Vt. 535, 872 A.2d 373 (mem.) (March 23, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Based on the evidence of father's substantial involvement in all aspects of his child's life, and the mutual devotion of father and child, the family court did not err in failing to give additional weight to the finding that mother was, at one time, the primary care provider. Porcaro v. Drop, 175 Vt. 13, 816 A.2d 1280 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the family court's findings indicated that the parties' circumstances since their separation had evolved to become a de facto shared custody arrangement, the court was not required to defer to mother's custodial status under a prior temporary order in evaluating the impact of her move out of state on the child's best interests. Porcaro v. Drop, 175 Vt. 13, 816 A.2d 1280 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the family court primarily relied upon the second, fifth, and seventh factors in subsection (b) of this section, as well as reviewing additional evidence, it made the appropriate inquiry regarding the factors and did not abuse its discretion by concluding that a grant of custody to father would serve the best interests of the children. Habecker v. Giard, 175 Vt. 489, 820 A.2d 215 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        In awarding sole parental rights and responsibilities to father, family court did not give undue weight to period during which mother was training for new job; although court's custody determination was based in part on mother's conduct during that period, court also considered individually each of the other requisite statutory factors. Pearson v. Pearson, 169 Vt. 28, 726 A.2d 71 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a divorce action, the family court did not abuse its discretion by awarding father responsibility for medical care, as mother had consistently made decisions in the past which seemed to reflect personal whim, and the desire to be different or all-controlling, rather than a willingness to follow generally accepted, sound medical practice. Shea v. Metcalf, 167 Vt. 494, 712 A.2d 887 (mem.) (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a divorce action, the family court did not abuse its discretion by awarding father responsibility for education, as mother's home schooling had failed to properly educate her children, demonstrated by the fact that the couple's eldest child could not read even simple words like "cat" nearly two years after he had been ready to start reading. Shea v. Metcalf, 167 Vt. 494, 712 A.2d 887 (mem.) (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a divorce, father was properly awarded parental rights and responsibilities, even though mother was the primary caretaker for most of the child's life. While this criterion should be given great weight unless the primary custodian is unfit, it does not create a presumption that the primary caretaker should be awarded custody. The court examined the quality of care provided by each parent at all relevant periods of the child's life and weighed the statutory factors in father's favor more heavily, including his successful completion of a parenting course; his provision of suitable and adequate nutrition, clothing, cleanliness, and other physical and emotional care for the child; and his dedication to his son's need for consistency, structure, intellectual stimulation, and continuity of environment. Hubbell v. Hubbell, 167 Vt. 153, 702 A.2d 129 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a divorce action, the court did not abuse its discretion by granting sole physical rights and responsibilities to wife, despite its conclusion that, if awarded primary legal rights and responsibilities, husband would have been much more likely to support and foster the child's relationship with mother than mother would have been to encourage the child's relationship with husband. The court recognized and considered mother's attempts to exclude husband from the child's life, but on balance concluded that mother's role as primary care provider and the need to preserve the resulting "close, warm, nurturing, and consistent relationship" between mother and her daughter outweighed other concerns. Cabot v. Cabot, 166 Vt. 485, 697 A.2d 644 (1997).

       <p>
        Best interests determination cannot be made in the absence of all the necessary facts, and speculation is not a substitute for complete analysis of all existing circumstances when and if a change in a child custody arrangement becomes necessary. By reference to the statutory factors, a family court must decide what custody arrangement serves the best interests of a child given the circumstances that exist at that time; after that, the family court's role is extinguished unless and until presented with the changed circumstances needed to support its jurisdiction to modify the award. Knutsen v. Cegalis, 187 Vt. 99, 989 A.2d 1010 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Despite the legislature's determination that an agreement between the parties on the issue of parental rights and responsibilities is presumptively in the best interests of children, a court is not bound by that agreement when the evidence demonstrates that the best interests of a child requires a different result. Because automatic changes concerning who has primary rights and responsibilities were not in the best interests of children, it mattered little to what extent the trial court relied on father's concession in crafting its order. Knutsen v. Cegalis, 187 Vt. 99, 989 A.2d 1010 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Difference between automatic custody change provisions involving definite versus indefinite dates is not critical, and both are unlawful. Knutsen v. Cegalis, 187 Vt. 99, 989 A.2d 1010 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Custody change is a significant and confusing change for a child, and when a court shifts rights and responsibilities between parents, every aspect of a child's life is subject to change - including everything from how much television the child watches to what school the child attends; thus, stability in custody arrangements is desirable due to the potential harm that inures to children as a result of shuttling them between their parents. Automatic change provisions build instability into a child's life, and this is so whether the automatic change is premised on an anticipated or unanticipated event. Knutsen v. Cegalis, 187 Vt. 99, 989 A.2d 1010 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Blanket rejection of automatic custody change provisions is consistent with the policy against forcing shared custody onto parents who are at war with each other. A court risks placing a child in the middle of constant disputes by forcing unwilling parents to share parental rights and make joint decisions; the evil the legislature sought to avoid by preventing courts from ordering parents to share rights and responsibilities in the absence of agreement was the negative effect the resulting animosity has on children. Knutsen v. Cegalis, 187 Vt. 99, 989 A.2d 1010 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Credibility determinations are for the trial court, not the appellate court. In a case where a father was awarded legal responsibility over the parties' children, the court was unwilling to second-guess the trial court's credibility determination as to the father. Solsaa v. Solsaa, 185 Vt. 587, 969 A.2d 116 (mem.) (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Routine splitting of physical and legal rights and responsibilities can be unwise; however, in some situations it is appropriate to grant one parent legal rights and the other physical rights. Here, the trial court awarded legal responsibility to the father on the ground that he was better suited to make the children's legal decisions in view of the events after the divorce, while the mother retained physical responsibility, and this ruling reflected the trial court's reasoned judgment in light of the evidence. Solsaa v. Solsaa, 185 Vt. 587, 969 A.2d 116 (mem.) (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's decision reflected that the trial court understood the parties' strained relationship and considered this in weighing the children's best interest. Thus, the court could not conclude that even considering the inability of the parents to cooperate, the trial court abused its discretion in awarding legal responsibility to the father while the mother retained physical responsibility. Solsaa v. Solsaa, 185 Vt. 587, 969 A.2d 116 (mem.) (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court's custody order did not violate the rights and responsibilities statute because it did not force the parents to share decision-making authority. The trial court granted the father legal rights and responsibilities, and the mother physical rights and responsibilities; the order strived to give each parent some control over the children's lives without forcing the parents to share authority over a particular area. Chase v. Bowen, 183 Vt. 187, 945 A.2d 901 (Feb. 8, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the trial court found that the parties were equally qualified to provide for the children's best interests under all but one of the statutory factors, the court could not say that the trial court abused its discretion in choosing to award physical rights to the mother and legal rights to the father. Chase v. Bowen, 183 Vt. 187, 945 A.2d 901 (Feb. 8, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Physical custody is not simply about the time a child spends with a parent; physical responsibility means the rights and responsibilities to provide routine daily care and control of the child subject to the right of the other parent to have contact with the child. Although the father, who had been awarded legal custody, had substantial contact with the boys, the mother, who had been awarded physical custody, was still the custodial parent and retained authority regarding the boys' routine daily care and control, even while they were in the physical company of their father. Chase v. Bowen, 183 Vt. 187, 945 A.2d 901 (Feb. 8, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a divorce action, the family court's division of discrete legal rights and responsibilities between the parties - father having exclusive authority for health care and education, and mother having exclusive authority for, inter alia, religion and travel - satisfied the statutory requirements that "when the parents cannot agree to divide or share parental rights and responsibilities, the court shall award parental rights and responsibilities primarily or solely to one parent," as the order avoided the problems of joint decision-making while satisfying the Legislature's intent that children retain "the opportunity for maximum continuing physical and emotional contact with both parents."

       <p>
        Trial court properly awarded primary custody to a mother in a father's request to modify parental rights and responsibilities, as the mother had previously been the primary caregiver and she had a limited ability to foster a positive relationship between the child and the father.

        Distinction between anticipated and unanticipated events that trigger an automatic custody change provision is one that should not impact a court's analysis. Courts lack the power to order an automatic change of custody operative solely on the occurrence of a birthday, the end of a school year or any other such happening, and further, it is doubtful that a court could ever provide for an automatic change of custody on the happening of any general or specific event; whatever a jurisdiction's rule regarding automatic change provisions, that rule is applied uniformly regardless of whether the contingency triggering the automatic change is certain to occur or speculative.

        Court did not exercise its discretion in an untenable or unreasonable manner by granting custody of children to wife granted a divorce where court found that father employed a 25 year old female to keep and maintain his home, paying her $100 a month plus "board and room", and had a propensity to spend his earnings on nonessentials rather than supporting his family.

        Factors relevant to a determination whether to award joint child custody to divorced parents are fitness of the parents and their ability to cooperate in guiding the child to adulthood, age of the child, distance between the parents' abodes, and frequency of transfer and proportion of each parent's custodial time, frequent changes being inherently disruptive and roughly equal division of custodial time being potentially more confusing to the child than a less balanced proportioning.

        Supreme court will presume that joint custody of child of divorced parents against the best interests of the child and require a trial court finding of some special circumstance indicating that such disposition would serve the child's best interest to overcome the presumption.

        In a divorce action involving a child, the trial court must award parental rights and responsibilities to one parent when the parties cannot agree to divide or share these responsibilities or when the court determines that a parental agreement is not in the child's best interests, basing the award on the best interests of the child, considering all relevant evidence, including the enumerated statutory factors; a proper decision requires a complete and balanced analysis, comparing the relevant attributes of each parent as they relate to the best interests of the child.

       </p>

        Subsection (b) of this section does not require that a stipulation be a complete agreement on parental rights and responsibilities in order to be presumed to be in the best interest of the child under subsection (a) of this section. Harris v. Harris, 149 Vt. 410, 546 A.2d 208 (1988).

        In a divorce action, the court exceeded its authority by ordering joint legal parental rights and responsibility absent consent of the parties. By enacting
        §
        666(b)(6) and (7), which requires parents who do agree to share or divide parental rights and responsibilities to nonetheless complete an agreement that addresses procedures for communicating about the child's welfare and for resolving disputes, the Legislature recognized the difficulties inherent in shared-parenting arrangements and, in light of these provisions, it seems unlikely that the Legislature intended to allow courts to force such an arrangement on parents.

        Trial court could reject stipulation relating to legal responsibility for the parties' children, which was filed after the hearing on the merits but before the court filed its order, only if it gave notice of its intention to the parties and gave them an opportunity to present evidence on the issues covered in the settlement.

        There is no specific statutory authority for the divorce order to define changed circumstances for purposes of a future modification nor has the court considered such a provision; however, without deciding whether such provisions will always be effective, the court concludes that the "relocation" provision was effective in this case because it was based on a stipulation of the parties, which is presumed to be in the best interest of the children, and the "relocation" provision itself established a reasonable benchmark to determine changed circumstances. deBeaumont v.

        Despite the legislature's determination that an agreement between the parties on the issue of parental rights and responsibilities is presumptively in the best interests of children, a court is not bound by that agreement when the evidence demonstrates that the best interests of a child requires a different result. Because automatic changes concerning who has primary rights and responsibilities were not in the best interests of children, it mattered little to what extent the trial court relied on father's concession in crafting its order.

        Rule regarding the factual basis for experts' opinions is not to be treated as either an auxiliary hearsay exception, or as a back door to an expansive reading of existing hearsay exceptions. In the case at hand, the family court's justification for using otherwise inadmissible statements contained within the report was based on the fact that the expert's report was entered into evidence by stipulation and, according to the family court, "without any restrictions"; this did not overcome the limits of the rule and statute governing the report's admission.

        Where defendant's lover was present in her home enough so that the court could find him to be a person who could significantly affect the parties' children within the meaning of section 665(b)(7) of this title, evidence of defendant's relationship with her lover was relevant and admissible under subsection (a) of this section.

        In a custody dispute, the report of an expert who examined the child was admissible since, by statute, reports of an expert "evaluating the best interests of the child" are admissible to determine parental rights and responsibilities "provided that the expert is available for cross-examination." In forming her report, an expert can rely on facts not admissible or admitted into evidence as long as the facts are of a type reasonably relied on by experts in the field. These facts can include hearsay statements. Velardo v. Ovitt, 182 Vt. 180, 933 A.2d 227 (July 27, 2007).

         1. Motion.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Given the parties' noncompliance with the rule requiring that any proceedings for modification of a divorce order shall be on motion, supported by an affidavit, the family court properly denied the motion to modify the order summarily. DeLeonardis v. Page, 188 Vt. 94, 998 A.2d 1072 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to modify a visitation order, the court must act on a motion. Brown v. Brown, 154 Vt. 625, 580 A.2d 975 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court was empowered to modify visitation of plaintiff where defendant's memorandum and supporting affidavit in opposition to plaintiff's petition to enforce a visitation order gave defendant clear notice of what was in issue and thus satisfied requirement of a motion upon which the court could act. Brown v. Brown, 154 Vt. 625, 580 A.2d 975 (1990).

         2. Change of circumstances.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court properly modified parental rights and responsibilities to give the mother sole physical rights and responsibilities, as the complete breakdown in the relationship between the child and the father constituted a substantial change in circumstances, preventing the parties from continuing to share physical custody, and the mother had a healthy relationship with the daughter and was better able to support her emotional and therapeutic needs. Wright v. Kemp, 209 Vt. 476, 207 A.3d 1021 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute governing modification based on change of circumstances may not open the door to modification of parent-child contact based on the mere fact of a child's predictably aging and reaching school age. Terino v. Bleeks, 208 Vt. 65, 195 A.3d 647 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the mere fact of a child's aging, including reaching school age, was not generally an unanticipated change of circumstances by itself under the statute governing modification, the family court erred in ruling that the parties could rely on the statute to modify parent-child contact as the child aged. Terino v. Bleeks, 208 Vt. 65, 195 A.3d 647 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a custody modification case, the specific factual errors alleged by the mother, if erroneous at all, did not, either individually or in combination, rise to the level of reversible error. The record was clear that as a result of the mother's allegations of sexual abuse, the parties' daughter was examined by multiple professionals; the trial court was not in error when it declined to recast the mother's statements as having been made by the emergency room physician; and other alleged errors were collateral to the findings that formed the basis for its changed-circumstances determination. Clark v. Bellavance, 204 Vt. 111, 162 A.3d 679 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a custody modification case, the trial court properly found that a real, substantial, and unanticipated change of circumstances took place when it found that the mother believed that the father had molested their daughter despite the lack of any credible evidence supporting the allegations, that the mother's belief caused her to treat the daughter as a victim to subject her to multiple invasive medical examinations and investigative interviews, and that the mother unilaterally breached the father's parent-child contact rights despite repeated warnings from the trial court not to do so. Clark v. Bellavance, 204 Vt. 111, 162 A.3d 679 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a custody modification case, the mother's argument that the trial court was biased against her and that its decision was tainted by what she characterized as "unflattering and prejudicial findings" about her relationship with the father prior to the original parenting order was unavailing. The mother produced no evidence to contradict the trial court's interpretation of record testimony that she had at least initially believed that the father's family had influence over the trial court, and any brief recitation of testimony about events that transpired prior to the original parenting order did not affect the trial court's ultimate findings on changed circumstances. Clark v. Bellavance, 204 Vt. 111, 162 A.3d 679 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        In modifying child custody to award legal rights and responsibilities to the father, the trial court did not err in finding a substantial change of circumstances, as the decision of where the child, who was autistic, would go to school was central to his welfare and best interest, and joint decision-making had wholly broken down with respect to that decision. Wener v. Wener, 203 Vt. 582, 157 A.3d 1108 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly awarded primary custody to a mother in a father's request to modify parental rights and responsibilities, as the mother had previously been the primary caregiver and she had a limited ability to foster a positive relationship between the child and the father. Hazlett v. Toomin, 190 Vt. 563, 27 A.3d 328 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Parties submitted their stipulation increasing defendant's parent-child contact after the hearing and after the final judgment; the parties presented their arguments at trial; and the trial court considered the relevant information in the context of the best interests of the children, after which it issued an order. Because the post-judgment stipulation contained no evidence of changed circumstances, the trial court had no need to hold yet another hearing or elaborate on the grounds of its decisions. DeLeonardis v. Page, 188 Vt. 94, 998 A.2d 1072 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Best interests determination cannot be made in the absence of all the necessary facts, and speculation is not a substitute for complete analysis of all existing circumstances when and if a change in a child custody arrangement becomes necessary. By reference to the statutory factors, a family court must decide what custody arrangement serves the best interests of a child given the circumstances that exist at that time; after that, the family court's role is extinguished unless and until presented with the changed circumstances needed to support its jurisdiction to modify the award. Knutsen v. Cegalis, 187 Vt. 99, 989 A.2d 1010 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        The family court has discretion in determining if the moving party has established a change of circumstances; the moving party bears a heavy burden to prove changed circumstances, and the court must consider the evidence carefully before making the threshold finding that a real, substantial and unanticipated change of circumstances exists. Sundstrom v. Sundstrom, 177 Vt. 577, 865 A.2d 358 (mem.) (October 21, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's findings showing that the parties' inability to share parental rights and responsibilities was a new development supported its conclusion that a substantial and material change of circumstances had occurred since the parties' divorce. Maurer v. Maurer, 178 Vt. 489, 872 A.2d 326 (mem.) (February 22, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the family court found that since the last motion to modify, mother had continued to interfere with father's telephone contact with the children; she had attempted to keep father from attending one of the children's first communion by refusing to tell him when the ceremony was scheduled; and she had filed a form with the children's school claiming that her boyfriend was the children's stepfather, which meant that father was not permitted to get information about the children; these findings supported the court's conclusion that mother had engaged in "willful, repeated interference" with father's visitation rights, and, therefore, the court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that there had been a material and substantial change in circumstances since the final divorce order. Sundstrom v. Sundstrom, 177 Vt. 577, 865 A.2d 358 (mem.) (October 21, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the family court finds that there has been a real, substantial and unanticipated change of circumstances, it must consider if a change in parental responsibilities is in the children's best interests; in conducting its analysis, the court must consider the statutory factors set forth in 15 V.S.A.
        §
        665(b). Sundstrom v. Sundstrom, 177 Vt. 577, 865 A.2d 358 (mem.) (October 21, 2004).

       <p>
        Relocation alone does not automatically constitute a change of circumstances. Habecker v. Giard, 175 Vt. 489, 820 A.2d 215 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though mother's proposed relocation was not, per se, a change of circumstances in and of itself, reassessment of the custodial arrangement was, however, clearly warranted based on evidence of a deteriorating and unanticipated change in the context of mother's relationship to her family, and this evidence was sufficient to support a finding of a real, substantial and unanticipated change of circumstances. Habecker v. Giard, 175 Vt. 489, 820 A.2d 215 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Based on testimony of both mother and father that they disagreed on most major issue concerning the children, including religion, education, extracurricular activities, whether the children should be participating in counseling and with whom, child care, and how mother and father should be communicating about the children, and on mother's testimony which chronicled a significant change in the parties' dealings with one another, the family court did not abuse its discretion by concluding that mother had sufficiently demonstrated a real, substantial and unanticipated change in circumstances justifying modification. Meyer v. Meyer, 173 Vt. 195, 789 A.2d 921 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        In proceeding for modification of an original divorce decree as to the allocation of parental rights and responsibilities, based on the court's findings regarding negative effects on the children of mother's and father's differing sets of religious beliefs, evidence of father's attempting to alienate the children from mother, and on the fact that the court was merely making explicit mother's decision as the custodial parent charged with legal responsibility for the children, the court's order that father not involve the children in his religious observances or raise them as Jehovah's Witnesses was not inconsistent with constitutional principles. Meyer v. Meyer, 173 Vt. 195, 789 A.2d 921 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        For purposes of modifying child custody, circumstances or arrangements are "unanticipated" if they were not expected at time of divorce. Hoover v. Hoover, 171 Vt. 256, 764 A.2d 1192 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petition for modification of visitation order was adequately supported by defendant's memorandum and affidavit that specifically alleged that child had nightmares and physical indications of sexual abuse after visits with plaintiff; awareness of plaintiff's past sexual abuse of older daughter and stepdaughter and risk to the child constituted real and substantial unanticipated change of circumstances. Brown v. Brown, 154 Vt. 625, 580 A.2d 975 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court did not err in finding that custodial parent's decision to attend law school in Iowa constituted an unanticipated changed circumstance justifying modification of custody order, where, although her plans to attend graduate school had been discussed by the parties prior to their divorce, at the time of the divorce, noncustodial parent reasonably concluded that the plans had been abandoned.

       </p>
       <p>
        A party seeking modification of decision-making provisions of a custody order does not have as heavy a burden as party seeking modification of physical custody of children; a change in decision-making does not entail the violent dislocation realized by a change in physical custody. Pill v. Pill, 154 Vt. 455, 578 A.2d 642 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        A party seeking modification of an order assigning physical custody of children, pursuant to a divorce, has a heavy burden to prove changed circumstances, and the trial court must consider the evidence carefully before making the threshold finding that a real, substantial and unanticipated change of circumstances exists. Pill v. Pill, 154 Vt. 455, 578 A.2d 642 (1990).
       </p>

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        With regard to a father's motion to reinstate parent-child contact with his daughter following a voluntary suspension of such contact due to an allegation of child sexual abuse, the evidence was sufficient to support the family court's finding by a preponderance standard that the father sexually abused the daughter. The daughter said that her drawings and stories involving rabbits were her way of showing that the father was doing "gross stuff," which she described as touching her in the wrong places and then lying about it; the father admitted to having prolonged kisses with the daughter, often upon the mouth, which the mother described as passionate; although a social worker's interview methods and her rapid adoption of the daughter's report of abuse were strongly criticized, it was not clearly erroneous for the family court to rely on her factual testimony regarding the daughter's disclosure; and evidence was presented of the daughter's agitation and distress surrounding her contact with the father. Desantis v. Pegues, 190 Vt. 457, 35 A.3d 152 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the family court's findings left no way to determine whether and how the court applied the best interest factors, or how it reached its conclusion to award mother sole legal rights and responsibilities, it was necessary to reverse and remand the question of whether the transfer of sole rights and responsibilities to mother was in the child's best interests to the court for additional findings. Maurer v. Maurer, 178 Vt. 489, 872 A.2d 326 (mem.) (February 22, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where custody order of divorce decree stated that a change in children's primary residence could be effected without court approval if the parties agreed it would be in the best interests of the children, since the parents could not agree, it was necessary that the court make a finding of a real, substantial and unanticipated change of circumstances as a threshold matter before it could consider whether a change in physical custody was in the best interests of the children, and its failure to do so required reversal. Pill v. Pill, 154 Vt. 455, 578 A.2d 642 (1990).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Given the change of circumstances and the parents' shared custody of daughter, the family court was correct to apply the best interests of the child standard upon the father's motion to modify parental rights and responsibilities. Chickanosky v. Chickanosky, 190 Vt. 435, 35 A.3d 132 (2011).
       </p>

        There are no fixed standards to determine what constitutes a substantial change in circumstances; instead, the court should be guided by a rule of very general application that the welfare and best interests of the children are the primary concern in determining whether the order should be changed.

        In order to modify a custody determination, a moving party must traverse two hurdles; first, the moving party must make a showing of real, substantial and unanticipated change of circumstances, and second, if that threshold is met, the moving party must show that annulling, varying or modifying a prior parental rights and responsibilities determination is in the best interests of the child. deBeaumont v.

         8. Relocation of custodial parent.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In considering a mother's motion to modify parent-child contact and legal rights and responsibilities, the family court erred by focusing on whether the mother's move was in the child's best interests and by effectively prohibiting the mother, the custodial parent, from moving with the child when it concluded that it was not. Instead, it should have considered whether the mother had shown a real, substantial, and unanticipated change of circumstances and whether the child's best interests would be optimally served by transferring physical rights and responsibilities to the father, and then fashioned a parent-child contact order that would serve the child's best interests, in light of its determination that physical rights and responsibilities should remain with the mother. Quinones v. Bouffard, 206 Vt. 66, 179 A.3d 173 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly denied a father's motion to modify parental rights and responsibilities based on changed circumstances stemming from the mother's move to Georgia. The father's parent-child contact was only one-quarter of the child's time and did not include legal rights or responsibilities; an alternative visitation schedule that continued the father's parent-child contact, albeit in a different form, could be established; the child's young age would make the move less disruptive in terms of connections to the community; and the record did not show that the proposed alternative schedule, which would give the father seven to eight weeks a year with the child in Vermont, could not work due to financial reasons. Falanga v. Boylan, 199 Vt. 343, 123 A.3d 811 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Relocation, by itself, is no basis to reassign custody; however, when combined with disruption of the children's stability and the likely substantial, if not total, loss of relationship with their father, the anticipated moves by mother were fairly considered. That repetitive relocation was required to be balanced against an arguably more stable "quality of the child's adjustment to . . . present housing, school and community," the child's established relationships with father and other significant family and friends, leavened, or not, by the parents' relationship with one another, as well as "the quality of the child's relationship with the primary care provider," are all a function of the statute and not merely the court's predilection. Likewise, the court's weighing of mother's decision to follow her husband's career at the expense of the children's relationship with their father was also a requirement of the statute's mandate to consider the relative merits of the parents' "ability and disposition . . . to meet the child's present and future developmental needs," as well as "foster a positive relationship" with the other parent. Rogers v. Parrish, 181 Vt. 485, 923 A.2d 607 (May 4, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the relocation of a custodial parent may be a ground to modify a preexisting parental rights and responsibilities order, it is not a sufficient ground to order that parent to return to this state. Adamson v. Dodge, 180 Vt. 612, 910 A.2d 821 (mem.) (August 24, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where mother's relocation left the parties over ninety miles apart, the family court acted within its discretion when it modified the parent-child contact order to account for the distance between the parties and the logistical dilemmas this distance presented. Adamson v. Dodge, 180 Vt. 612, 910 A.2d 821 (mem.) (August 24, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether a relocation or other change is substantial enough to meet the threshold must be determined in the context of all the surrounding circumstances, keeping in mind that the effect on the child is what makes a change substantial. Hawkes v. Spence, 178 Vt. 161, 878 A.2d 273 (May 6, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although a custodial parent's relocation, by itself, does not automatically satisfy the threshold showing of changed circumstances, neither does relocation alone automatically preclude the family court from finding changed circumstances just because the relocating party is the custodial parent. Hawkes v. Spence, 178 Vt. 161, 878 A.2d 273 (May 6, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        A critical factor in relocation cases is the amount of rights and responsibilities exercised by each parent; in considering that factor, the family court should not necessarily rely on the custodial assignments in the final divorce order, but rather consider the parties' actual parenting arrangement. Hawkes v. Spence, 178 Vt. 161, 878 A.2d 273 (May 6, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Relocation by a custodial parent, in and of itself, may amount to changed circumstances; further, while the allocation of legal rights and responsibilities could certainly be a factor in determining whether there are changed circumstances, the physical custodian has a right to determine the child's residence. Hawkes v. Spence, 178 Vt. 161, 878 A.2d 273 (May 6, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        In regard to whether mother's proposed relocation was a real, substantial and unanticipated change of circumstances the relevant question is whether her relocation would significantly impair father's ability to continue exercising the rights and responsibilities he has been exercising. Among the relevant factors that should be considered in addressing this question are (1) the amount of custodial responsibility that the parties have been exercising, and for how long, (2) the distance and duration of the move, and (3) the availability of alternative visitation arrangements. Hawkes v. Spence, 178 Vt. 161, 878 A.2d 273 (May 6, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court may find no changed circumstances with respect to a proposed relocation that nonetheless requires the court to modify the parties' parent-child-contact schedule. Hawkes v. Spence, 178 Vt. 161, 878 A.2d 273 (May 6, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a divorce action in which plaintiff wife was considering relocating to another state, wife should have been asked to choose between stating that she would move, allowing the court to include plaintiff's relocation as a factor in its custody decision, or that she had made no firm decision to move, in which case any later relocation have been an unanticipated change, allowing the defendant to ask for modification of the custody order on the basis of changed circumstances. Gazo v. Gazo, 166 Vt. 434, 697 A.2d 342 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Decision of custodial parent to move to another state triggers jurisdiction to modify custody order, but is not in and of itself sufficient to allow court to second-guess custodian in determining appropriateness of that change. Lane v. Schenck, 158 Vt. 489, 614 A.2d 786 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appraisal of custodial parent's decision to relocate to another state should take into account both the family's needs in the short term and the family's benefit in the more distant future. Lane v. Schenck, 158 Vt. 489, 614 A.2d 786 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        To prevail on motion for change of custody based on custodial parent's decision to move to another state, noncustodial parent must prove that the children's best interests would be so undermined by relocation with custodial parent that transfer of custody is necessary. Lane v. Schenck, 158 Vt. 489, 614 A.2d 786 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where noncustodial parent's motion for modification of custody requested change in custody or change in visitation schedule and child support to accommodate increased cost and travel burdens due to custodial parent's intended relocation to Iowa, court focused on wrong inquiry and fashioned an improper modification when it sought to determine whether it was in the best interests of the children to move to Iowa and conditioned retention of custody by imposing condition on where custodial parent could reside; proper inquiry was to determine appropriate custodial parent in light of the move to Iowa. Lane v. Schenck, 158 Vt. 489, 614 A.2d 786 (1992).

       <p>
        Where evidence was sufficient to support the family court's finding that father's care of the children nearly approximated mother's in the qualitative sense, there was no basis to disturb its conclusion that mother's proposed relocation, combined with her disinclination to abide by father's interest and rights to parent-child contact, would likely erode or destroy the children's relationship with their father. Rogers v. Parrish, 181 Vt. 485, 923 A.2d 607 (May 4, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where parents have shared parenting responsibilities over time and have both spent substantial time with the child, the child's loss from one parent's relocation is substantial regardless of which parent gets custody of the child.

       </p>
       <p>
        Family court did not err by granting father sole legal and physical custody of children, since evidence supported court's factual findings that parties shared custody up to time mother moved children out of state, that father was more engaged in and committed to children's lives, and that best interests of children favored their living in Vermont with their father over living in Connecticut with their mother.

       <p>
        It was error to suspend all parent-child contact with the father when the family court had not found that any further contact, even in a supervised or therapeutic setting, would be detrimental to the daughter's best interests and when the record would not support such a finding, but rather showed that the father had been an involved, loving parent and maintained frequent contact with the daughter until an incident where he posted disparaging comments about her stepfather following an argument with the daughter. Thus, remand was required for the family court to consider contact for the father upon such terms and conditions as it found to be in the current best interests of the daughter. Wright v. Kemp, 209 Vt. 476, 207 A.3d 1021 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court had good reason to decline to impose a provision that automatically shifted parent-child contact when the child reached school age. It would have been premature and presumptuous to set forth a plan for more extended contact based on the information currently available to the parties. Terino v. Bleeks, 208 Vt. 65, 195 A.3d 647 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court properly modified the parent-child contact schedule to reduce the mother's time with the child and to restrict her telephonic and electronic communications with him. The evidence supported the trial court's finding of a substantial change in circumstances in that the mother was unwilling to follow the new visitation schedule and was enabling or encouraging child not to do so; furthermore, the family court found that the child's best interests were not served by extensive contact with the mother because she continued to undermine his relationship with the father and because her fixation on the alleged wrongs perpetrated by the father prevented her from seeing the child's real needs for structure, discipline, and medical treatment. Weaver v. Weaver, 207 Vt. 236, 186 A.3d 1119 (Apr. 6, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the mother's move was for an indefinite duration and a two-and-a-half-hour drive separated the parties' homes, the move constituted a real, substantial, and unanticipated change of circumstances for the purpose of the mother's motion to modify parent-child contact and thus required the trial court to issue a new contact schedule. Bonk v. Bonk, 206 Vt. 522, 183 A.3d 600 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Obstruction of visitation and attempts at parental alienation are not in a child's best interests, and they may form the basis for a change in custody. Sundstrom v. Sundstrom, 177 Vt. 577, 865 A.2d 358 (mem.) (October 21, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        By changing the operative language in a parent-child contact order regarding Mother's Day from "if possible" to "shall," the trial court made a discretionary matter into an obligatory order, resulting in modification of the order without the required finding of a real, substantial, and unanticipated change in circumstances. The trial court also modified the order by limiting the father's ability to make travel arrangements for the child. Patnode v. Urette, 206 Vt. 212, 179 A.3d 1242 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Absent a showing by clear and convincing evidence that any visitation, including supervised visitation, would be detrimental to the daughter's best interests, the family court erred by halting all contact between the daughter and her father after finding under a preponderance standard that the father had sexually abused the daughter. This required remand for the family court to consider parent-child contact for the father upon such terms and under such conditions as the family court deemed necessary and appropriate in the best interest of the daughter. Desantis v. Pegues, 190 Vt. 457, 35 A.3d 152 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no error in the family court's application of a best-interests-of-the-child standard to a father's motion to reinstate parent-child contact following a voluntary suspension of such contact due to an allegation of child sexual abuse. First, it was unclear what prejudice the father suffered as a result of the imposition of the threshold showing for modification of the visitation order; second, the language of the voluntary suspension order contemplated court action; and finally, the passage of time without any contact, coupled with the allegations of abuse and the effect such allegations had on the daughter's well-being, required the family court to reexamine what level of parent-child contact would most benefit the daughter.

       <p>
        To the extent that the family court modified parental rights and responsibilities through a 1999 agreement of the parties, it was a valid exercise of the family court's jurisdiction; however, as an attempt to alter the parentage determination in the original divorce decree, the order was null and void because the family court lost jurisdiction to amend such determinations once the nisi period had run, absent a motion to amend the judgment. Therefore, there was no merit to a father's argument that the 1999 agreement removed the necessary predicate (parentage) upon which to base an award of college expenses. O'connell-Starkey v. Starkey, 183 Vt. 10, 944 A.2d 897 (Nov. 30, 2007).

        Trial court properly found that granting defendant's motion to modify the parenting schedule was in the child's best interests. Its finding that the child had loving and supportive relationships with both parents and that a basic schedule of reasonable time with defendant would offer an undisputed path that both parents and the child could rely and plan on was supported by the record, and the trial court stated that in applying the factors, there was no significant distinction between the parties except the ability and disposition of each parent to foster a positive relationship with the other, which plaintiff had not demonstrated. Fabiano v. Cotton, - Vt.
    - , 249 A.3d 1268 (Sept. 25, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        In its best-interests analysis, the trial court did not determine that the primary-caretaker factor favored the father solely because he had physical custody of daughter at the time of the custody modification hearing, but appropriately considered the roles that both parents had played during the crucial period between the initial parenting order and the filing of the motion to modify; it noted the bond that had developed between the father and the daughter, which need not necessarily result simply from having primary custody of the child for a period of time. Clark v. Bellavance, 204 Vt. 111, 162 A.3d 679 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a custody modification case, there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's conclusion that it was in the daughter's best interests that the father have custody. The trial court found that the daughter seemed more relaxed and happy in her father's custody and that she had grown comfortable with the father as the primary caretaker; moreover, the mother's persistent belief that the father molested the daughter formed the basis for its best-interests analysis, and the trial court relied heavily on the report of an expert who found, inter alia, that the mother needed the daughter to play the role of an injured child with severe emotional problems.

        On a petition to modify a child custody order, trial court must fist determine whether there has been a real, substantial and unanticipated change of circumstances; only if such a change is found may the court move on to the question of the best interest of the child. Kilduff v. Willey, 150 Vt. 552, 554 A.2d 677 (1988). (Decided under former
        §
        652.)

        Giving stability to a child's life, to the extent possible under the circumstances, is so important that custody ought not to be modified without critical justification. Kilduff v. Willey, 150 Vt. 552, 554 A.2d 677 (1988). (Decided under former
        §
        652.)
       </p>
       <p>
        As prerequisite to modifying a custody order, the petitioner must prove a substantial change in the material circumstances and that under the new conditions a change of custody is in the best interests of the child or children. Hayes v. Hayes, 144 Vt. 332, 476 A.2d 135 (1984). (Decided under former
        §

        In a change of child custody proceeding, wishes of a child found to be opposed to the child's best welfare must yield. Valeo v. Valeo, 132 Vt. 526, 322 A.2d 306 (1974). (Decided under former
        §

       </p>
       <p>
        To justify modification of custody order petitioner must first show that there has been change of circumstances, and then go on to show that under new conditions change of custody would be for best interests of child. Gokey v. Gokey, 127 Vt. 334, 248 A.2d 738 (1968). (Decided under former

         6. Procedure.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        A court considering modification of child custody should take the findings of the court that issued the original order and compare or contrast them with whatever findings it has made about the parties' circumstances since the original order. Hayes v. Hayes, 144 Vt. 332, 476 A.2d 135 (1984). (Decided under former
        §
        652.)
       </p>
       <p>
        It is permissible for a court considering modification of child custody to make explicit reference to the original court's findings if appropriate, but it should not ordinarily take evidence or make independent findings concerning events that transpired prior to the divorce decree. Hayes v. Hayes, 144 Vt. 332, 476 A.2d 135 (1984). (Decided under former
        §
        652.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the trial court which modified a custody order made finding concerning events that occurred before the divorce decree and original custody award, the supreme court would not apply a rule of per se reversal because the modification court's findings overlapped somewhat with those of the original court. Hayes v. Hayes, 144 Vt. 332, 476 A.2d 135 (1984). (Decided under former

        In a proceeding for modification of an original divorce decree as to the allocation of parental rights and responsibilities, where there was no evidence that either party had anything other than the children's best interest in mind, the court's failure to appoint a guardian ad litem for the children was not an abuse of discretion.

        In a parental-rights-and-responsibilities case, the court may appoint a guardian ad litem for the child, whose role is to minimize the harm suffered by the child during the breakup of the family rather than to assist the attorney and the child in making the choices that parties must make in our adversary system; in essence, the guardian acts as a buffer between the child and the adversarial nature of our judicial process.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Second sentence of the statute governing access to records in child custody cases makes plain that a noncustodial parent's general right of access to his or her children's records is subject to a statutory limitation. Therefore, a court can curtail a noncustodial parent's general right of access by finding either that disclosure is not in the child's best interests or that disclosure may harm the other parent. Rinehart v. Svensson, 204 Vt. 390, 169 A.3d 198 (2017).

       </h5>
       <p>
        While the court is permitted by statute to restrict the noncustodial parent's access to a child's records, such an order must be based on the criteria set forth in the statute. Here, the family court's order restricting the mother's access to the child's records was unsupported by any findings or analysis and therefore had to be reversed. Weaver v. Weaver, 207 Vt. 236, 186 A.3d 1119 (Apr. 6, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court properly denied a father, the noncustodial parent, access to his sons' mental health records, as a noncustodial parent's general right of access to the records was subject to the child's best interests and here, the family court found the boys could be prevented from seeking or succeeding in treatment or could be emotionally harmed by a forced disclosure. Rinehart v. Svensson, 204 Vt. 390, 169 A.3d 198 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        As the family court had extensive prior dealings with the parties and received additional briefing on the issue after remand, and neither party raised a new issue that required further fact-finding, the evidence was sufficient to support the court's determination denying a father access to his sons' mental health records despite the lack of a hearing and new factual findings after remand, and the opinion as a whole clearly demonstrated the family court's proper focus on the best interests of the children. Rinehart v. Svensson, 204 Vt. 390, 169 A.3d 198 (2017).

      </p>
      <p>
       "(1) The military population in our state exceeds 5,000 Vermonters, a majority of whom serve a traditional part-time role. Many of these service members are parents to children under the age of 18.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(2) The mobilization of these military parents, with sometimes little advance notice, can have a disruptive effect on custody or visitation arrangements involving minor children.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(3) It is in the best interests of these children to minimize the loss of parental contact and disruption of the family that results from the service member's absence pursuant to military orders due to temporary duty performed outside the state, deployment, or mobilization.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(4) It is important to maintain parent-child contact as much as feasible when the child's parent is absent due to military orders.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(5) It is in the best interests of these children for the courts to address the military membership of one or both parents at the time of the initial custodial order or anytime thereafter, regardless of whether the service member has temporary duty orders or a deployment or mobilization order.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(6) The regular scheduling of hearings may be harmful to the interest of service members who, due to military orders, may need an expedited hearing or may need to use electronic means to give testimony when they cannot appear in person in court.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(7) The use of expedited hearings and testimony by electronic means, at the request of the service member who is absent or about to depart, would aid and promote fair, efficient, and prompt judicial processes for the resolution of family law matters."

Deployment includes a period during which a military parent remains subject to deployment orders and remains deployed on account of sickness, wounds, leave, or other lawful cause.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c11sub04s681ol12">
       "Deploying parent" means a military parent who has been notified by military leadership that he or she will deploy or mobilize with the U.S. Armed Forces, including any reserve component thereof, or who is currently deployed or mobilized with the U.S. Armed Forces, including any reserve component thereof. "Nondeploying parent" means a parent who is either not a member of the U.S. Armed Forces, including any reserve component thereof, or is a military parent who is currently not a deploying parent.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c11sub04s681ol13">
       "Military parent" means a natural parent, adoptive parent, or legal parent of a child under the age of 18 whose parental rights have not been terminated or transferred to the state or another person through a juvenile proceeding pursuant to 33 V.S.A. chapter 53 or guardianship pursuant to 14 V.S.A. chapter 111 by a court of competent jurisdiction, and who is a member of the U.S. Armed Forces, including any reserve component thereof.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c11sub04s681ol14">
       "Mobilization" and "mobilize" mean the call-up of National Guard or Reserve service members to extended active service. For purposes of this definition, "mobilization" does not include National Guard or Reserve annual training, inactive duty days, drill weekends, temporary duty, or state active duty.
      </li>
      <li id="t15c11sub04s681ol15">

       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court has power to distribute marital assets, including bank accounts and securities, in whatever manner it finds just and equitable, regardless of prior owner. Milligan v. Milligan, 158 Vt. 436, 613 A.2d 1281 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section requires division of marital property however and whenever acquired, and is broad enough to cover property acquired after parties have separated. Nuse v. Nuse, 158 Vt. 637, 601 A.2d 985 (mem.) (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Distribution of property in a divorce action must be equitable, not necessarily equal. Myott v. Myott, 149 Vt. 573, 547 A.2d 1336 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Division of marital property in a divorce proceeding is not an exact science. Plante v. Plante, 148 Vt. 234, 531 A.2d 926 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        All that is required of distributions of marital property in divorce cases is that they be equitable, and because individual circumstances are considered by the court, equality is not a necessary predicate to equity. Burr v. Burr, 148 Vt. 207, 531 A.2d 915 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        The distribution of property upon divorce is not an exact science and does not always lend itself to a precise mathematical formula; all that is required is that such distribution be equitable. Kinley v. Kinley, 140 Vt. 77, 435 A.2d 698 (1981); Victor v. Victor, 142 Vt. 126, 453 A.2d 1115 (1982); Ruhe v. Ruhe, 142 Vt. 429, 457 A.2d 628 (1983); Roberts v. Roberts, 146 Vt. 498, 505 A.2d 676 (1986); Lalumiere v. Lalumiere, 149 Vt. 469, 544 A.2d 1170 (1988).

       <p>
        Trial court lacked authority to impose an enforceable visitation order for divorcing parties' dog because a property division order was final and not subject to modification, and unlike child custody matters, there was no legislative authority for the court to play a continuing role in the supervision of the parties with respect to the care and sharing of a companion animal. Hament v. Baker, 196 Vt. 339, 97 A.3d 461 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family division had exclusive jurisdiction over the division of the marital property of parties whose marriage was annulled due to having been deemed void at its inception. Cameron v. Rollo, 196 Vt. 346, 97 A.3d 454 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutory authority of the family division to divide marital property extends to cases of annulment, divorce, and legal separation. Cameron v. Rollo, 196 Vt. 346, 97 A.3d 454 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where wife sought an appropriate disposition of property in her divorce complaint; where at trial her counsel asked for permission to submit wife's requests in writing as opposed to having her testifying about them, husband indicated no objection, and the court granted the request; where the written requests were submitted on time and included the request for the home; and where in the two and one-half months following submission of the requests, husband never objected to the request for the award of the home or sought to put on new evidence, husband had fair notice of the procedure and the request and there was no error because the request for the home came after the evidentiary hearing. Jakab v. Jakab, 163 Vt. 575, 664 A.2d 261 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont's property distribution statute requires the court to equitably divide and assign the property and sets out twelve factors that the court may consider; the trial court has wide discretion in considering these factors and need not specify the weight given to each factor but is required only to provide a clear statement as to what was decided and why, and its decision will be upheld unless its discretion was abused, withheld, or exercised on clearly untenable grounds. Jakab v. Jakab, 163 Vt. 575, 664 A.2d 261 (1995).

        Statutory homestead exemption, purpose of which was to protect homeownership from loss to creditors, did not apply in context of divorce, and therefore family court did not err by imposing $15,000 lien on mother's real estate in course of its division of marital property. Pearson v. Pearson, 169 Vt. 28, 726 A.2d 71 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        All property owned by either spouse, whether held separately, jointly, or as tenants by the entirety, is subject to distribution under this section. Lynch v. Lynch, 147 Vt. 574, 522 A.2d 234 (1987).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Assets are normally valued for distribution as of the day of the final divorce hearing, regardless of whether they were acquired before or after the parties separated. Thus, the family court acted within its discretion in considering stock options received by husband after the date of separation and including them in the marital estate for division. Golden v. Cooper-Ellis, 181 Vt. 359, 924 A.2d 19 (March 2, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where using the date of separation as a cut-off date would fail to capture as marital property a significant part of husband's compensation for the marital period, the family court acted within its discretion in determining that stock options awarded after separation were marital property subject to distribution. Golden v. Cooper-Ellis, 181 Vt. 359, 924 A.2d 19 (March 2, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        The family court has broad discretion when analyzing and weighing the statutory factors in light of the record evidence. Wade v. Wade, 178 Vt. 189, 878 A.2d 303 (July 1, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding wife all of the marital assets she requested so that she received approximately 43% of the assets while husband received approximately 57% where, in support of its award, the court explained that, because both parties were gainfully employed and healthy, and in the absence of fault, and because both were capable of working for many more years, the amount of property awarded to each did not need to be precisely equal to be fair. Turner v. Turner, 176 Vt. 588, 844 A.2d 764 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Potential costs such as taxes or commissions cannot affect the valuation of a marital asset; yet, the trial court has the discretion to consider such costs in establishing the amount and method of payment of any monetary award. Hayden v. Hayden, 176 Vt. 52, 838 A.2d 59 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court did not abuse its discretion where it considered the implications of a hypothetical real estate commission on the overall difference between the property awards but did not deduct the real estate commission from its valuation of the marital home. Hayden v. Hayden, 176 Vt. 52, 838 A.2d 59 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court did not abuse its discretion in allocating husband's tax-deferred savings plan and car debt, and in awarding a clock to wife, because, given his employment and earning history, husband, unlike wife, has the ability to acquire future capital assets, and evidence supported the award of the clock. Weaver v. Weaver, 173 Vt. 512, 790 A.2d 1125 (mem.) (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court's decree extinguished the marital interest each party had in all the property in the marital estate; thus, the wife's lien on the house awarded to the husband did not attach to his preexisting interest in the homestead so as to be avoidable in bankruptcy proceeding brought by the husband. In re Farrar, 219 B.R. 48 (Bankr. D. Vt. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no abuse of discretion in family court's distribution which gave defendant husband roughly forty percent of the marital assets because family court based its award on a careful consideration of each of the factors specified in 15 V.S.A.
        §
        751(b), and it used the property award to reimburse wife for $11,680 husband owed under the temporary order for maintenance, property taxes on the house, and reimbursement of wife's medical bills; subtracting out this reimbursement, the distribution was close to fifty percent each. Soutiere v. Soutiere, 163 Vt. 265, 657 A.2d 206 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the trial court noted and evaluated each of the statutory factors set out in 15 V.S.A.
        §
        751,
    observed the inconsistency between wife's testimony and her requested findings, but determined that, given the extreme substantial fault of the husband and the needs of the children, the marital home was to be awarded to wife free and clear of husband's interest, and where sufficient findings existed to support these conclusions, Supreme Court could not conclude that the award amounted to an abuse of discretion. Jakab v. Jakab, 163 Vt. 575, 664 A.2d 261 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although trial court has discretion in considering the twelve factors that the court may consider in distributing marital assets in dissolution proceeding, the findings must provide a clear statement as to what was decided and why. Dreves v. Dreves, 160 Vt. 330, 628 A.2d 558 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's discretion in dividing marital assets is not limited to the increase in value during the marriage since all property owned by either party is subject to the jurisdiction of the court. Dreves v. Dreves, 160 Vt. 330, 628 A.2d 558 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court made a thorough examination of the factors enumerated in 15 V.S.A.
        §
        751(b) when awarding the house to the plaintiff and refusing to give the defendant compensation for his share of the house, and its ruling was reasonable. Stafford v. Stafford, 161 Vt. 580, 641 A.2d 348 (mem.) (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court has broad discretion in awarding marital property in divorce action. Williams v. Williams, 158 Vt. 574, 613 A.2d 200 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Disposition of property pursuant to divorce decree is matter of wide discretion for trial court, and it will not be disturbed unless court's discretion was abused, withheld or exercised on untenable grounds or to clearly unreasonable extent. Milligan v. Milligan, 158 Vt. 436, 613 A.2d 1281 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court has broad discretion in considering statutory factors governing distribution of property in a divorce, and its decision will be upheld unless its discretion was abused, withheld, or exercised on grounds clearly untenable. Semprebon v. Semprebon, 157 Vt. 209, 596 A.2d 361 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court has wide discretion in the distribution of marital property upon divorce, and the supreme court will affirm the decision where it finds reasonable evidence to support the trial court's findings and conclusions. Johnson v. Johnson, 155 Vt. 36, 580 A.2d 503 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Property division and maintenance awards are closely related under statutory scheme and court must give due consideration to both; the court may, in its sound discretion, conclude that significant amounts of both property and maintenance should be awarded. Johnson v. Johnson, 155 Vt. 36, 580 A.2d 503 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court has broad discretion in considering the factors set forth in this section, and unless the court fails to exercise its discretion or exercises it for clearly untenable reasons or to an untenable extent, its decision will be upheld. Klein v. Klein, 150 Vt. 466, 555 A.2d 382 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Disposition of couple's assets that was close to an even split of the property valued was within range of trial court's discretion, in view of all factors including wife's lower earning power, wife's contribution to husband's professional development, and husband's substantial inheritance from his father. Klein v. Klein, 150 Vt. 466, 555 A.2d 382 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court has broad discretion in dividing property in a divorce action. Myott v. Myott, 149 Vt. 573, 547 A.2d 1336 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>

         5. Valuation of property.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court's finding concerning the value of the husband's accounts receivable was supported by the evidence. The trial court reasonably assigned a value that reflected a deep discount over the face value of the accounts receivable, while also accounting for the husband's lack of effort to collect them. Jaro v. Jaro, 208 Vt. 391, 198 A.3d 1270 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court should have valued the parties' marital property as close to the date of the final divorce hearing as possible, not the date of the parties' separation. Valuing the parties' retirement funds and other marital property as of the time the parties separated in December 2015, rather than when the trial court held the final hearing in September 2017, might mean the trial court did not accurately consider the entire monetary value of the parties' marital assets. Lee v. Ogilbee, 208 Vt. 400, 198 A.3d 1277 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err with regard to its distribution of retirement assets and a house that the father co-owned with his aunt. The trial court's conclusions that the marriage was of short duration and that both parties had an opportunity for future income and inheritance of additional assets were relevant to its order awarding the retirement account to the mother and setting off the value of an anticipated inheritance against increases in that account; it weighed the father's anticipated receipt of his aunt's interest in the home against the retirement account's increase in value and awarded him a sum of money from that account. MacCormack v. MacCormack, 199 Vt. 233, 123 A.3d 383 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        In dividing the parties' property, the trial court erred in using a hypothetical real-estate commission to reduce the value of the father's payout from the increase in the home's equity, as the fact that there would be no sale in the refinancing scenario meant that the inclusion of the hypothetical real-estate commission had the effect of directly modifying the value of the asset being awarded. MacCormack v. MacCormack, 199 Vt. 233, 123 A.3d 383 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether or not a lease was negotiated at arm's length, it represented the source of income for the property owners now and for some period in the future. Thus, in a divorce case, the trial court properly considered it in valuing the property by the income capitalization method. Drumheller v. Drumheller, 185 Vt. 417, 972 A.2d 176 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a divorce case, the trial court properly concluded that a lease rate was within market range, as its decision was based on record evidence that the lease was fair to both parties involved. Moreover, whether the lease was above market rate was not determinative of its use in valuating a partnership interest, unless the rate somehow undermined the finding that a business would remain a tenant. Drumheller v. Drumheller, 185 Vt. 417, 972 A.2d 176 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        In valuing property in a divorce case, the trial court's finding that a business would remain a tenant for seven years was supported by the evidence. The business had an option to renew for the remainder of the seven years; the building was one of the largest commercial buildings in the county and had been modified three times to meet the unique needs of the business; the cost for the business to move to a new building would be substantial and would require a substantial amount of time; and no witness testified that a move was likely for any reason. Drumheller v. Drumheller, 185 Vt. 417, 972 A.2d 176 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a divorce case, the trial court properly refused a minority discount to the husband, who owned a one-third interest in a partnership. While the husband did not have a controlling interest in the partnership, he was certainly the most important of the three equal partners because he had effective control of the corporate tenant from which the income was derived; reducing the value of the partnership interest, while the husband received full income from the partnership based on full valuation, would be unfair to the wife. Drumheller v. Drumheller, 185 Vt. 417, 972 A.2d 176 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        On appeal from a divorce case, the wife repeated the arguments she made to the family court as to why it should reject the opinion of husband's expert as to valuation and adopt that of her expert. These arguments were properly made to the trial court, but were out of place on appeal; the trial court had the discretion to accept the expert's opinion as it did. Drumheller v. Drumheller, 185 Vt. 417, 972 A.2d 176 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the family court found that a nursery school operated by the wife in her home had value to her because it provided a modest livelihood and personal fulfillment, the court did not err in its finding that the school had no market value. Wade v. Wade, 178 Vt. 189, 878 A.2d 303 (July 1, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the court's primary reasons for awarding the residence to wife were to provide a homeplace for the children and to give her something in lieu of maintenance in light of husband's greater earning capacity, the absence of precision in valuation of the property was harmless. Mills v. Mills, 167 Vt. 567, 702 A.2d 79 (mem.) (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, the court may consider the contribution of a spouse to the depreciation in value of property, and where wife used her revoked power of attorney to refinance the marital home and spent all the proceeds from the financing, the court properly considered this conduct in making its property disposition. However, the court cannot award more of the marital estate than exists, so where the evidence failed to demonstrate that the amount awarded actually existed, the property settlement and maintenance award were vacated. Schwartz v. Selden-Schwartz, 165 Vt. 499, 685 A.2d 665 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        As a general proposition, marital assets should be valued as close to the date of trial as possible; however, this proposition does not hold that trial courts are obligated to accept automatically the more recent of two appraisals since the appellate court does not intend to restrict what evidence is admissible, or can be relied upon, to determine that valuation. Kanaan v. Kanaan, 163 Vt. 402, 659 A.2d 128 (1995).
       </p>

        Best method of valuation of closely held company in divorce action will necessarily depend on particular facts and circumstances. Goodrich v. Goodrich, 158 Vt. 587, 613 A.2d 203 (1992).

        Supreme court would not mandate single methodology for determining value of interest in closely held company in divorce action. Goodrich v. Goodrich, 158 Vt. 587, 613 A.2d 203 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where divorce court's valuation of stock of closely held company, which accepted wife's view that valuation should reflect what a willing buyer would pay for the stock from a willing seller, was supported by credible evidence in record, it was not clearly erroneous. Goodrich v. Goodrich, 158 Vt. 587, 613 A.2d 203 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in valuation of limited partnerships awarded wife in divorce case, since it was unsupported by evidence; because change in valuation of partnerships could affect positions of parties in property distribution, and require reconsideration of maintenance award, entire decree, except granting of divorce, was remanded. Johnson v. Johnson, 158 Vt. 160, 605 A.2d 857 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the trial court may consider the potential tax when establishing the amount and method of any monetary award, the court does not consider the basis in the property when determining the value of the asset. Mabee v. Mabee, 159 Vt. 282, 617 A.2d 162 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>

       </p>

       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in failing to add almost $400,000 in case which husband's business had on hand at the time it was valued for property settlement where court could conclude that the cash was considered by the expert witnesses in valuing the business.

       </p>
       <p>
        It is an abuse of discretion for trial court to premise its division of marital property on outdated valuations of the assets involved; an equitable distribution, as mandated by subsection (a) of this section, cannot be achieved by relying on stale valuation data.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where neither party offered any evidence of the value of husband's law practice, trial court's determination that the practice was property of undetermined value to be distributed to husband and to be considered for its income in assessing the appropriateness of an award of maintenance to wife was correct.

       <p>
        Husband's beneficial interest in irrevocable trusts was marital property. The property distribution statute states that all property owned by either or both of the parties shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the court, and this is true even if title to the interest is exclusively in the name of one party. Billings v. Billings, 190 Vt. 487, 35 A.3d 1030 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        That the family court discussed the interests in irrevocable trusts as being the husband's interests did not indicate that it did not consider them part of the marital estate; it merely meant that the family court correctly understood that the husband, and not the wife, was the named beneficiary of these trusts. Neither did the fact that the family court ultimately decided to distribute the interest in these trusts to the husband indicate that the family court determined the trusts were not part of the marital estate; this distribution merely meant that the family court determined it was equitable to allocate these assets to the husband as part of the division of the marital estate. Billings v. Billings, 190 Vt. 487, 35 A.3d 1030 (2011).
       </p>

        Despite a pretrial order awarding her $5,000 from the husband for this purpose, the wife failed to produce a valuation expert for the two irrevocable trusts in issue, leaving the family court without adequate evidence to arrive at valuations. It was within the family court's discretion to determine that it lacked the requisite evidence to accurately determine the value of husband's interests in the two trusts, and it was within its discretion to distribute the two irrevocable trusts to the husband.

        Where the court determined that while wife's name was listed with those of her sister and mother on each of deeds, wife's mother was the actual owner of the properties in question, and found that wife's mother had placed the names of her daughters on the deeds to avoid probate, and that both daughters understood that wife's mother retained "full authority to maintain, sell, lease or otherwise dispose of" the properties as she saw fit, the court did not abuse its discretion by looking behind the deeds and refusing to award any portion of these properties to husband.

        A husband has no vested or "homestead" right in real estate standing in the name of his wife such that it cannot be taken from him without compensation; there is no requirement in any law which mandates that compensation must be paid to the former owner before title is vested in the judgment beneficiary of a divorce order, and such a requirement would render meaningless the court's power under this section to distribute the marital assets in whatever manner it finds just and equitable regardless of the prior owner.

       <p>
        Likely receipt of future inheritances and trust assets or proceeds may be considered under the subsection of the property distribution statute dealing with "opportunity . . . for future acquisition of capital assets and income." The statute does not distinguish between different opportunities based on the means by which the opportunity is created. Billings v. Billings, 190 Vt. 487, 35 A.3d 1030 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Necessarily, future assets to be considered under the subsection of the property distribution statute dealing with "opportunity . . . for future acquisition of capital assets and income" are not marital property; otherwise they would be distributed between the parties. Thus, the fact that the beneficiary interest is merely an expectancy during the life of the testator or settlor prevents that interest from being marital property but does not prevent it from being considered under the subsection; indeed, because a property distribution cannot be modified where a change of circumstances occurs, it is necessary to have a grasp of predicted future circumstances to bring about a fair result. Billings v. Billings, 190 Vt. 487, 35 A.3d 1030 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court improperly granted a motion in limine that preemptively excluded evidence about the extent of the husband's potential interest in revocable trusts and wills. These could be considered under the subsection of the property distribution statute dealing with "opportunity. . . for future acquisition of capital assets and income." Billings v. Billings, 190 Vt. 487, 35 A.3d 1030 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a divorce case, it would have been inappropriate to consider the tax liability on a sale of assets if no asset was to be sold and the husband was to accrue no tax liability. While the husband argued that the trial court failed to exercise its discretion, the court read the trial court's decision differently - that is, that the trial court was unconvinced that there would be any tax liability and declined to change the property award for this purpose. Drumheller v. Drumheller, 185 Vt. 417, 972 A.2d 176 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        The family court may include as marital assets property that has been placed in other names to avoid distribution to a spouse. Kasser v. Kasser, 179 Vt. 259, 895 A.2d 134 (January 6, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though husband violated the family court's interim order prohibiting the parties from transferring any marital property by withdrawing money from his investment account for his own purposes, the court erred in concluding that his continued trading of stocks was also a violation because his management of the investment account was, for him, business in the ordinary course and not prohibited by the general language of the order. Jenike v. Jenike, 177 Vt. 502, 857 A.2d 798 (mem.) (August 3, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        A trial court is required by statute to explain its rationale for awarding funds placed in a retirement account before the marriage and following separation to the employee spouse rather than dividing these funds equally, therefore, where the trial court's decision contained no discussion of the factors that the statute requires the court to consider in formulating a property settlement, on remand, the court must consider the factors laid out in the statute in making an equitable property settlement. Hayden v. Hayden, 176 Vt. 52, 838 A.2d 59 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court may consider the parties' liabilities when deciding how to allocate property, but nothing in the statutes mandates that the court determine the parties' rights with respect to their debts, absent some request to do so. Demgard v. Demgard, 173 Vt. 526, 790 A.2d 383 (mem.) (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Several factors weigh in favor of giving the mother a larger share of the marital property: she withdrew from the work force for several years to raise the children while the husband went to work and steadily gained earning power, she lost her future ability to earn an income by taking care of the children, she will have to raise two children without earning power, and she is not currently receiving a maintenance award; such factors make the $10,000.00 property settlement in the wife's favor extremely inequitable. Harris v. Harris, 162 Vt. 174, 647 A.2d 309 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Among the factors to be considered by the court in making its decision as to the disposition of property upon divorce are the source of the property, the respective merits of the parties, the conditions with which each would be left by the divorce, the needs of the children and a general equitable result.

         13. Property settlement in lieu of or in addition to maintenance.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        When the family court made a combined property and maintenance award that provided the wife with an income stream of essentially the same amount per month from the date of the divorce and indefinitely thereafter, the awards were to be viewed as a package. The family court did this by providing the full monthly amount through maintenance until the anticipated date of the husband's retirement and thereafter through retirement pension income supplemented by a small amount of maintenance. Molleur v. Molleur, 191 Vt. 202, 44 A.3d 763 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court did not abuse its considerable discretion in awarding the wife 75 percent of the marital portion of the husband's military pension, which amounted to a little over 40 percent of his total pension, in order to create an income stream that would meet the wife's minimum needs above her employment income. The husband was entitled to be credited for his greater relative contributions and merits, while the length of the marriage and the asymmetry in the parties' circumstances and future prospects suggested a distribution to the wife, and the court found no basis to second-guess the family court's choice of the balancing point. Molleur v. Molleur, 191 Vt. 202, 44 A.3d 763 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute governing maintenance contemplates that the family court will devise an equitable property settlement, taking into account the factors under this section, including fault, before it considers whether the financial circumstances of the parties justify an award of maintenance. Jenike v. Jenike, 177 Vt. 502, 857 A.2d 798 (mem.) (August 3, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although property and maintenance issues are related, the considerations justifying a property settlement are different from those grounding maintenance awards, and they must not be confused in the final analysis. Jenike v. Jenike, 177 Vt. 502, 857 A.2d 798 (mem.) (August 3, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where divorce action was remanded for consideration of a maintenance awarded, property award would also be reopened because of the interrelationship of those two parts of the financial order. Semprebon v. Semprebon, 157 Vt. 209, 596 A.2d 361 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court is required to look at interrelationship of property disposition and maintenance determination. Klein v. Klein, 150 Vt. 466, 555 A.2d 382 (1988).

        Determination of whether the property settlement is in lieu of or in addition to maintenance is a factor the court may consider when dividing the property. DeGrace v. DeGrace, 147 Vt. 466, 520 A.2d 987 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Property division was vacated, where court's findings were insufficient to support maintenance award, and there was nothing in the record to indicate whether court had consider the maintenance award in determining the property division. DeGrace v. DeGrace, 147 Vt. 466, 520 A.2d 987 (1986).

         15. Family home.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Even if the family court miscalculated the home equity, this minor error was an erroneous nonessential finding that did not require reversal of the court's property disposition in a divorce case. Casavant v. Allen, 202 Vt. 606, 151 A.3d 1233 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the mother admitted that it was not economically feasible for her to pay for the marital residence by herself and then asked the trial court to award her 70 percent of the equity in the home, the trial court was justified in concluding that she preferred a large percentage of the equity in the home rather than the home itself. Frazer v. Olson, 200 Vt. 13, 127 A.3d 86 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Awarding a father an $85,000 share of the equity in the martial home was not excessive. The family court found that the father was entitled to more than just the value of his labor, as he had worked to support the family and care for the children and the mother's prospects of acquiring additional wealth through inheritance were substantially better than his. Paine v. Buffa, 195 Vt. 596, 93 A.3d 90 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        In dividing the equity in the marital home, the family court did not impermissibly adjudicate the rights of the mother's parents, who had brought a collection action against the parties. In essence, it allocated any future judgment against the parties in favor of the mother's parents as a debt owed by the mother only; by so doing it fulfilled its statutory duty to equitably divide and apportion marital assets and liabilities. Paine v. Buffa, 195 Vt. 596, 93 A.3d 90 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        In making its decision involving the parties' home, the family court did not fail to consider repairs that would have to be made before the home could be sold. It was by no means clear from the mother's brief testimony on the issue what the nature of the problem with the septic system was, and there was no evidence that it rendered the house unmarketable. Paine v. Buffa, 195 Vt. 596, 93 A.3d 90 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court properly awarded the father an $85,000 share of the equity in the marital home when it found that the marital home was the parties' only valuable asset and that the father was entitled to receive a share of the equity in order to allow him a stake to continue the task of parenting the parties' children. Its decision fell within its wide discretion to fashion a schedule for distribution of the marital property. Paine v. Buffa, 195 Vt. 596, 93 A.3d 90 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence supported the family court's determination that the parties' home was a marital asset unencumbered by the claims of the mother's parents. While the mother's parents provided the funds to purchase the property as well as substantial additional funding for improvements, there were none of the ordinary indicia associated with a typical loan, as opposed to a gift, and the mother's parents never demanded repayment until the divorce was set for a contested trial. Paine v. Buffa, 195 Vt. 596, 93 A.3d 90 (2014).

       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse its discretion to equitably distribute property in divorce proceeding by dividing sole asset jointly owned, the family residence, in equal shares despite evidence of husband's physical abuse of wife; it appeared from record trial court weighed defendant's egregious conduct against parties' relative contributions to acquiring and maintaining property and husband's ill health.

        In dividing property, the trial court did not err in failing to attribute fault for the breakup of the marriage to the wife based on her infidelity. It found that fault was not a decisive factor, given the conduct of both parties. Felis v. Felis, 193 Vt. 555, 72 A.3d 874 (2013).

       <p>
        In a divorce action, trial court's finding that former wife had abandoned the home was not supported by the evidence where the former wife had testified that she left the home because of irreconcilable differences with her former husband and that her leaving was by mutual consent, and where her former husband testified that he concurred in her decision to leave; merely leaving the homestead in and of itself was not sufficient to justify a finding of fault under this section.

       </p>
       <p>
        When a court apportions a pension between parties to a divorce, it must apply a coverture fraction to reflect the proportion of the entire pension attributable to the marriage; the coverture fraction reflects the proportion of the entire pension attributable to the marriage. Hayden v. Hayden, 176 Vt. 52, 838 A.2d 59 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Pension rights acquired by party to divorce during course of marriage constitute marital property and are subject to equitable distribution along with other assets, since money was either deposited at party's option or by employer in lieu of higher compensation which would otherwise have enhanced marital standard of living; there is no general barrier to distribution of pensions as marital assets.

Boisclair v. Boisclair, 176 Vt. 646, 852 A.2d 617 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if a distribution was not entirely fair to wife, both parties entered into the agreement voluntarily, and the fact that wife might have negotiated a more advantageous bargain was not grounds to set aside an otherwise valid agreement. Boisclair v. Boisclair, 176 Vt. 646, 852 A.2d 617 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if there is a stipulation between the parties dividing marital property, the court must make an independent termination of whether the distribution is equitable. Poulin v. Upham, 149 Vt. 24, 538 A.2d 181 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        In disposing of marital property, trial court is not bound by stipulations between the parties, but acts within its discretion in making a different disposition of the property based on evidence before it. Lewis v. Lewis, 149 Vt. 19, 538 A.2d 170 (1987).

        Where parties, during pendency of their divorce proceedings, entered into a temporary property settlement agreement which, by conveyance to another who then reconveyed back to the parties, resulted in apportionment to husband of far more valuable real property than to wife, lower court's refusal to be bound by the agreement was correct, because both parties regarded it as temporary and, in divorce actions, court has absolute right to decree such disposition of property as appears just and equitable.

       <p>
        Order placing proceeds from defendant's annuity in divorce matter in trust fund for daughters' educational costs was improper, since agreement parties had to provide education to daughters was not recognized by section 659(b) of this title, governing agreements to place postmajority support provisions in orders, and court had no authority to create educational trust for use beyond children's age of majority.

        Trial court did not err in awarding a lump-sum payment of $18,000 to the wife as part of its property division award, given its finding that she was in debt because she received minimal support from the husband during the year and a half before the final divorce hearing; moreover, through the wife's divorce complaint and trial testimony, the husband had sufficient notice that she was seeking spousal maintenance and a lump-sum cash award to help her get started following the divorce, and any error in the way the trial court framed its award was harmless.

        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in valuing and allocating the husband's truck and tool business equipment. While the trial court could have exercised its discretion to award the truck and tool equipment to the husband at his agreed value of $75,000, the wife testified that she needed the funds from the sale of these assets to pay marital debts, so the trial court could have reasonably concluded that the best way to ensure that the equipment would be timely sold, and debts correspondingly paid down, would be to award them to the wife.

The husband remained employed with annual wages of $52,000; the family court awarded him a car, the remaining savings of $8000 and a pending personal injury claim; and while the husband was assigned the tax debt, the family court freed him from any further obligation on the home mortgage loan or other expenses related to the marital home.

        In determining that the husband of divorcing parties was to be awarded the parties' pet dog, the treatment of the dog was an appropriate factor upon which to base the decision, as well as the dog's welfare and its emotional relationship with the parties. Hament v. Baker, 196 Vt. 339, 97 A.3d 461 (2014).

       <p>
        Allocation of a pet in a divorce is not subject to a custody award following a determination of its best interests because a pet is property; the family division must assign it to one party or the other and like other aspects of the property division, the assignment is final and generally not subject to modification. Hament v. Baker, 196 Vt. 339, 97 A.3d 461 (2014).

       <p>
        Award of approximately 57 percent of the marital estate to the wife was well within the trial court's discretion, given the wife's homemaker role throughout the course of the long-term marriage and the fact that the wife was receiving marital property in lieu of a maintenance award. Felis v. Felis, 193 Vt. 555, 72 A.3d 874 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        In dividing property, the trial court did not show bias against a husband by assigning to him all of the liability associated with an aging commercial property used as a manufacturing facility for one of his businesses. In assigning the debt solely to the husband, the trial court noted the possibility of the property eventually turning a profit and also the wife's outstanding attorney's fee obligation beyond that awarded by the trial court. Felis v. Felis, 193 Vt. 555, 72 A.3d 874 (2013).

       <p>
        Reversal and remand were required in a divorce case when the trial court's property division decision was based on a mistaken understanding that the wife had agreed to the husband keeping the equity in the home and not on an equitable division of the property. Furthermore, on remand, the trial court had to provide an explanation for how it distributed the personal property. Hanson-Metayer v. Hanson-Metayer, 193 Vt. 490, 70 A.3d 1036 (2013).

        Maintenance arrearage was a debt that could be reallocated by the family court in its final decree. The family court was well within its discretion in determining that it was equitable to nullify the arrearage. Billings v. Billings, 190 Vt. 487, 35 A.3d 1030 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly found that a settlement agreement was equitable. It considered the parties' lengthy marriage, the fact that the husband had a much greater ability than the wife to generate income and acquire assets, and the fact that absent the agreement, the wife would be entitled to a large maintenance award; it also provided the husband ample opportunity to present evidence regarding the financial consequences of enforcing the agreement. Camara v. Camara, 188 Vt. 566, 998 A.2d 1058 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a divorce case, the trial court properly enforced the parties' settlement agreement. The wife had unconditionally accepted the husband's offer, and her attempt to include indemnification and mutual release provisions in a draft was not a counteroffer, but merely an attempt to modify the existing contract. Camara v. Camara, 188 Vt. 566, 998 A.2d 1058 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        When one party's mother owned a 50 percent interest in the couple's house, the fundamental flaw in the family court's equity determination was its application of the couple's outstanding debt on the mortgage against the fair market value of the house, rather than against the value of the couple's interest in the house. When the couple's debt was properly accounted for, it became apparent that the couple had no equity in the house; the error was not harmless, because this "equity" was found to be the parties' largest asset, and it was awarded to defendant along with the obligation to pay the parties' debt to her mother. DeLeonardis v. Page, 188 Vt. 94, 998 A.2d 1072 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in dividing the value of the parties' assets equally when it considered the statutory factors and concluded that an equitable division would be for the wife to receive ownership of the house and the husband ownership of his business, with the payment of an equalization amount by the husband because the business was more valuable than the house. Moreover, with respect to the comparative merit of the parties, the trial court concluded that the primary cause of the marital breakup was the husband's controlling and abusive behavior, including threats of violence. Gravel v. Gravel, 186 Vt. 250, 980 A.2d 242 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the family court was in the best position to assess the merits of the parties' contentions, and its decision addressed the relevant statutory factors, it could not be said that the court abused its discretion in fashioning the property award giving wife approximately ninety percent of the marital property. Wade v. Wade, 178 Vt. 189, 878 A.2d 303 (July 1, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in considering, for distribution purposes, parties' entire fifteen year relationship rather than only four years they were legally married, or in considering defendant's inherited stock portfolio as a marital asset to be distributed. Wall v. Moore, 167 Vt. 580, 704 A.2d 775 (mem.) (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a divorce action, the court did not improperly award wife $12,000, a sum equal to one-third of the equity in the property, as her share in the marital home, as, although the home was given to the parties by husband's parents to benefit their son, the contributions of each party to the marital estate were essentially equivalent. Also the parties had already divided the personal property, each receiving property of nearly equivalent value. Putnam v. Putnam, 166 Vt. 108, 689 A.2d 446 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where trial court's only explanation as to why former wife was awarded only 12.5 percent of the total value of marital assets at issue was the marriage was fairly short and that nearly all of the assets were originally attributable to former husband, but failed to take into account that former wife left her home state and her employment there, that she withdrew from the work force and served as homemaker for two years of the marriage, that former husband's earning capacity was considerably greater than hers, and that she would have to find a suitable place to live since former husband was awarded the homeplace, and no specific findings as to the percentage of the increase in marital assets during the marriage were made, case was remanded for court to make a clear statement as to why the disparity in the property awarded was so significant. Dreves v. Dreves, 160 Vt. 330, 628 A.2d 558 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Property distribution in divorce action which resulted in wife receiving martial assets valued at $141,000 while husband's share was $43,170 was not erroneous where husband benefitted materially from wife's ownership of stock in closely held company while not contributing to enhancing its value and husband was awarded marital home, the only substantial asset joint acquired during the marriage. Goodrich v. Goodrich, 158 Vt. 587, 613 A.2d 203 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Uneven distribution of marital property in favor of wife was not an abuse of discretion where husband had opportunity to receive future income from irrevocable trust, wife had a relatively lower earning capacity, and where the respective merits of the parties supported uneven distribution. Chilkott v. Chilkott, 158 Vt. 193, 607 A.2d 883 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where trial court in divorce action awarded marital residence to wife, subject to $25,000 lien payable to husband upon wife's remarriage, sale of the property, or when their daughter became eighteen years of age, it abused its discretion in failing to award husband interest during the passage of time until husband realized his $25,000 share. Williams v. Williams, 158 Vt. 574, 613 A.2d 200 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where trial court's findings with respect to distribution of marital property provided a clear statement as to what was decided and why and evinced sufficient consideration of statutory factors, distribution which resulted in roughly a 65%-35% split in favor of husband did not amount to an abuse of discretion. Semprebon v. Semprebon, 157 Vt. 209, 596 A.2d 361 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where trial court in divorce action ordered that the former wife be awarded 8.4 acres of a 14.4-acre parcel of real estate acquired during the marriage and that the remaining 6 acres, divided into three 2-acre parcels with a suitable right of way be awarded to the former husband, sold, and the proceeds invested and the interest used to pay child support, since there was no evidence that the parcel could be divided into one 8.4 and three 2-acre lots, the 2-acre parcels had not been surveyed, the necessary easement had not been laid out, none of the sites had been checked to determine if they had a sufficient water supply or to ascertain the feasibility of installing septic system, and the sale of the lots would be subject to zoning approval which had not been applied for, the trial court's order was incapable of performance an, therefore, constituted an abuse of discretion. Atwood v. Atwood, 143 Vt. 298, 465 A.2d 1354 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Action of trial court, in dividing the property of the parties in a divorce proceeding by awarding the home and furnishings of the parties, valued at $25,000 to the husband and awarding the wife only $5,000 deferred payment for her interest in the property, did not constitute an abuse of discretion in light of the husband's preponderance of contribution to the existing equity and the burden of support left to him under the divorce decree and in light of the infidelities and misconduct of the wife. Jackson v. Jackson, 139 Vt. 548, 432 A.2d 1181 (1981).

       <p>
        Where alimony and child support order gave wife all but $222.798 a week of husband's monthly salary of $893.05 and it appeared that husband had no other income, the order appeared on its face to be inequitable and perhaps impossible of compliance, and where there were no findings the cause would be remanded for a rehearing, the preparation of findings, and a new alimony, child support and property disposition order, and that appellant husband had not requested findings did not prevent the grant of relief.

        Order for equal division of property of divorced parties would be overturned where lower court had concluded that the absence of liquidity placed both parties in a very precarious financial position and therefore the properties should be equally divided, for neither the absence of liquidity nor the precarious financial position of the parties justified the equal division and neither was contained in this section stating what the court should consider when disposing of property; and the order would be overturned even though the same result might have been reached without the improper conclusion and even though statutory factors was considered, where the absence of liquidity apparently received greater consideration.

        A separation agreement later incorporated into a final divorce order could not be collaterally attacked, in an action in superior court, on the grounds that the agreement was unconscionable and obtained through fraud, deceit and duress. Although plaintiff labeled her complaint a tort action, in fact she was attempting to relitigate the property distribution agreement that the family court adopted rather than asserting a unique claim separate and distinct from the divorce decree.

         35. Beneficial interests.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In a divorce case where the husband's father changed the beneficiary of his trust to the parties' son, the family court did not err in excluding the trust assets from the marital estate, as the father was always entitled to name a new beneficiary, regardless of his timing or purpose, and the wife offered no evidence that the son was merely a nominal holder of the trust assets. Collins v. Collins, 205 Vt. 251, 173 A.3d 345 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any interest a spouse has as beneficiary under a will or revocable trust is not marital property if the testator or settlor is still alive; however, such a beneficial interest can be considered in allocating marital property between the parties if it creates an "opportunity . . . for future acquisition of capital assets and income" under the property settlement statute. Billings v. Billings, 190 Vt. 487, 35 A.3d 1030 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Near unanimous holdings around the country are that a beneficiary's interest under a will is not property before the death of the testator, but instead is only an expectancy that is not subject to the jurisdiction of the family court. The Vermont Supreme Court adopts these holdings as the proper interpretation of the property settlement statute. Billings v. Billings, 190 Vt. 487, 35 A.3d 1030 (2011).

       <p>
        By filing for divorce, a wife did not acquire equitable title through the property settlement statute to property owned by the husband and therefore was not entitled to a homestead exemption with regard to the mortgage on that property. The family court's injunction against the alienation of marital property did not affect this result, as it did not give either party a right to any item of property. Brattleboro S&L Ass'n v.

       <p>
        Husband's interest in certain farm property was inchoate and thus could not be distributed as marital property, as the husband's mother retained a life estate and the power to sell or mortgage the property during her lifetime and therefore retained full control over it during her lifetime. This expectancy, however, could be considered with respect to the husband's opportunity to acquire future assets and income. Coburn v. Cook, 196 Vt. 410, 97 A.3d 892 (2014).

         39. Duration of marriage.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In the context of a long-term marriage such as the one here, the trial court's property-division order lacked sufficient analysis balancing the merits of the parties' contributions over the course of the marriage and their joint decision making with the rest of the statutory factors. Most importantly, the trial court failed to clearly articulate why it awarded the spouse with the greater financial contributions and historically higher earning capacity a larger percentage of the parties' property in the context of their long-term marriage. Lee v. Ogilbee, 208 Vt. 400, 198 A.3d 1277 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court acted within its discretion in not including the parties' premarital relationship or cohabitation period in calculating the duration of the marriage for equitable distribution and maintenance purposes, as the parties were unemployed or underemployed then and had initially kept their finances separate, and the wife was not financially dependent upon the husband then.

        In this section, the word "spouse" means a party to the marriage. Poston v. Poston, 160 Vt. 1, 624 A.2d 853 (1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 816, 114 S. Ct. 66, 126 L. Ed. 2d 35 (1993).

         2. Purpose.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        There was nothing erroneous in the family court's denial of husband's motion to modify spousal maintenance, without hearing, because nothing in the stipulation underlying the order, or the order itself, made the maintenance obligation contingent on the recipient seeking employment or training. Miller v. Miller, 179 Vt. 147, 892 A.2d 175 (November 4, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of rehabilitative maintenance is to give the recipient spouse the opportunity to develop or redevelop employment skills that will allow her or him to achieve economic self-sufficiency in the future. The time limit creates an economic incentive to maximize income production as soon as possible, with the understanding that the obligor's maintenance obligation will normally end at a time certain, irrespective of the recipient's need. Miller v. Miller, 179 Vt. 147, 892 A.2d 175 (November 4, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of spousal maintenance is to rectify inequality between the parties' financial positions. Poston v. Poston, 160 Vt. 1, 624 A.2d 853 (1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 816, 114 S. Ct. 66, 126 L. Ed. 2d 35 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the purpose of rehabilitative maintenance is to assist the recipient-spouse in becoming self-supporting, in a long-term marriage, maintenance also serves to compensate a homemaker for contributions to family well-being not otherwise recognized in the property distribution. Strauss v. Strauss, 160 Vt. 335, 628 A.2d 552 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        One of purposes of maintenance is recompense for contributions of homemaker to family's well-being which was not otherwise made. Klein v. Klein, 150 Vt. 466, 555 A.2d 382 (1988).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Ordering payment of money as alimony, and granting of alimony in any form, being but an incident to granting of divorce, court ordinarily, unless divorce is granted, has no power or jurisdiction to grant permanent alimony. Loeb v. Loeb, 118 Vt. 472, 114 A.2d 518 (1955), (Decided under 15 V.S.A.
        §
        754 prior to 1981 (Adj. Sess.) amendment.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Order for payment of alimony is in its nature personal and without personal service in state where made or appearance of petitionee is subject to infirmities of ex parte judgment, should its enforcement against petitionee be sought in foreign jurisdiction; however, if proceeding is such that property of petitionee in this state is thereby brought before court and within its control, such order is valid to extent of such property, though court does not have jurisdiction of person of petitionee. In re Callahan's Estate, 115 Vt. 128, 52 A.2d 880 (1947), amendment.), (Decided under 15 V.S.A.
        §
        754 prior to 1981 (Adj. Sess.) amendment.)
       </p>
       <p>
        In divorce proceedings court has no jurisdiction to decree payment of money as alimony where petitionee is a nonresident, has no notice except by publication, and does not appear. Smith v. Smith, 74 Vt. 20, 51 A. 1060 (1901), (Decided under 15 V.S.A.
        §

       </h5>
       <p>
        Where trial court in divorce action failed, without explanation, to address wife's request for spousal maintenance, case would be remanded for consideration of a maintenance award. Semprebon v. Semprebon, 157 Vt. 209, 596 A.2d 361 (1991).

         5. Discretion of court.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        It was not an abuse of discretion for the court to consider defendant's past earnings to predict his future income because although defendant contended that the trial court erroneously determined that he had the ability to pay maintenance because it wrongfully imputed his income using his former $65,000 salary, the trial court found that defendant voluntarily quit his job and was underemployed as a real estate salesman at the time of trial, defendant
    testified that while he had not received any real estate commissions to date, he had listed several homes and sold one, and
    defendant's own testimony was that he would take over his father's real estate business for a quicker income and a better income and he claimed that the sky could be the limit. Kohut v. Kohut, 164 Vt. 40, 663 A.2d 942 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no abuse of discretion in family court's distribution which gave defendant husband roughly forty percent of the marital assets because family court based its award on a careful consideration of each of the factors specified in 15 V.S.A.
        §
        751(b) and it used the property award to reimburse wife for $11,680 husband owed under the temporary order for maintenance, property taxes on the house, and reimbursement of wife's medical bills; subtracting out this reimbursement, the distribution was close to fifty percent each.

        Trial court has broad discretion in determining the amount and duration of maintenance once grounds for award are established under statutory criteria, and a maintenance award will be set aside only if there is no reasonable basis to support it.

        Upon dissolution of marriage, court may decree to wife such part of husband's property, or such sum of money in lieu thereof, as it deems just, having regard for circumstances of parties, respectively; in fixing amount of award, court is vested with a wide, but judicial, discretion; in determining what will be a just award it is duty of court to give consideration to all facts affecting situation of either party that will be helpful to such determination.

        In fixing amount of award to wife upon dissolution of marriage, trial court is vested with wide discretion, and its decision therein is not ordinarily subject to review, but if court declines to consider material fact, well proved, or makes what is manifestly an unjust award, supreme court will correct error.

       </p>
       <p>
        Maintenance order which calculated arrearage due from date of temporary order when final order that superseded it was held to be of no effect, but which lacked evidence trial court knowingly exercised its discretion in establishing that the effective date of the permanent award, was remanded, and since court had offset arrearages against equity in marital home, affected property award was also remanded.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Spousal maintenance guidelines calculation, while important, is not presumptive; that is, a court need not justify a departure from the guideline range. However, like any other statutory factor, the court must consider the guideline spousal maintenance range in fashioning its spousal maintenance award. Jaro v. Jaro, 208 Vt. 391, 198 A.3d 1270 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        In awarding spousal maintenance, the trial court did not err in departing from the guidelines, as it considered the guidelines and chose to weigh other factors and considerations more heavily. Jaro v. Jaro, 208 Vt. 391, 198 A.3d 1270 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Pension is just another type of income-producing asset; thus, pension income is always an important factor in determining whether alimony should be paid and how much either spouse should receive. Any source of income is material to such a determination. Mayville v. Mayville, 189 Vt. 1, 12 A.3d 500 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont adheres to the majority rule that in considering the amount of maintenance to award, or whether to modify a maintenance order, the family court may include as income to the obligor any income derived from assets, including a pension, awarded to the obligor in the property distribution. Mayville v. Mayville, 189 Vt. 1, 12 A.3d 500 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of compensatory alimony is to compensate the recipient spouse for contributions made during the marriage, not after. It is precisely for this reason that the duration of the marriage is such a critical factor. Braun v. Greenblatt, 182 Vt. 29, 927 A.2d 782 (June 15, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the court must consider the expenses of both spouses, including their current tax obligations and estimates of their future tax obligations, in setting the amount of the maintenance award, it cannot simply shift an expense from one party to another regardless of future fluctuations and call it spousal maintenance. Braun v. Greenblatt, 182 Vt. 29, 927 A.2d 782 (June 15, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court may award maintenance, either rehabilitative or permanent, to a spouse when it finds that the spouse lacks sufficient income, property, or both, including property distributed pursuant to the divorce decree, to "provide for his or her reasonable needs" and the spouse is unable to support himself or herself "through appropriate employment at the standard of living established during the marriage." The maintenance must be in the amount and for the duration the court deems just, based on the consideration of seven nonexclusive factors. Kasser v. Kasser, 179 Vt. 259, 895 A.2d 134 (January 6, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the trial court explicitly grounded its maintenance decision on an impermissible factor, husband's bad conduct, the case was remanded for the court to consider wife's request for maintenance anew without taking into account husband's fault for ending the marriage. Jenike v. Jenike, 177 Vt. 502, 857 A.2d 798 (mem.) (August 3, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section contemplates that the family court will devise an equitable property settlement, taking into account the factors under 15 V.S.A.
        §
        751, including fault, before it considers whether the financial circumstances of the parties justify an award of maintenance. Jenike v. Jenike, 177 Vt. 502, 857 A.2d 798 (mem.) (August 3, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although property and maintenance issues are related, the considerations justifying a property settlement are different from those grounding maintenance awards, and they must not be confused in the final analysis. Jenike v. Jenike, 177 Vt. 502, 857 A.2d 798 (mem.) (August 3, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        In awarding maintenance, the trial court is required to consider the property division between the parties pursuant to statutory requirements. Hayden v. Hayden, 176 Vt. 52, 838 A.2d 59 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly considered earnings of divorce defendant's current wife, as this income related to defendant's present financial situation, and established that defendant did not have unforeseen financial obligations resulting from his new marriage. Wardwell v. Clapp, 168 Vt. 592, 720 A.2d 862 (mem.) (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        A couple may, if they are able to obtain credit and choose to do so, live an extravagant lifestyle that they cannot afford, but such a financial arrangement cannot last forever, and it can rarely last beyond a divorce, when property and income must be split to support two households, despite the requirement that the court consider the standard of living established during the marriage. Indeed, the wife's financial demands proved this point well. The court correctly concluded that these demands were "unreasonable." Cabot v. Cabot, 166 Vt. 485, 697 A.2d 644 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err by failing to fashion a maintenance award based on the exact standard of living established during the marriage where the parties agreed that they lived beyond their means and were constantly borrowing money and receiving substantial assistance from defendant's parents and because it was unlikely that such a lifestyle was sustainable after the divorce. Kohut v. Kohut, 164 Vt. 40, 663 A.2d 942 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining the amount and period of time for which maintenance is to be awarded, the court must consider a number of factors, including the reasonable needs of the recipient and the standard of living established during the marriage. Kohut v. Kohut, 164 Vt. 40, 663 A.2d 942 (1995).

        Restitution for past homemaker contributions, while not recognized by 15 V.S.A.
        §
        752(b), has been recognized by the Vermont Supreme Court. Clapp v. Clapp, 163 Vt. 15, 653 A.2d 72 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although husband contended that trial court erred in considering past homemaker contributions of wife since there was no evidence of extent of such contribution, there was no error in court's application of this nonmonetary contribution factor because homemaker contributions are, by their nature, nonmonetary and cannot be quantified and court found that wife delayed her education and entry into job market in order to raise parties' children while they were infants, parties jointly decided that wife should work in school system, rather than in other employment, with higher remuneration, in order to care for children and manage home, and wife's occupation enabled her to stay home during summer. Clapp v. Clapp, 163 Vt. 15, 653 A.2d 72 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        15 V.S.A.
        §
        752(b)(1) does not prohibit award that gives to party income higher than his or her reasonable needs because need is only one of factors to be considered. Clapp v. Clapp, 163 Vt. 15, 653 A.2d 72 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Equalizing the parties' financial status for an appropriate period is a proper purpose; however, courts have not favored the use of formulas for determining maintenance awards; particularly disfavored are awards requiring one spouse to pay a percentage of gross or net income to the other spouse. Delozier v. Delozier, 161 Vt. 377, 640 A.2d 55 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        A maintenance award must fall within flexible confines of this section which authorizes award where spouse cannot meet his or her reasonable needs and either is the custodial parent or is unable to maintain the standard of living established during the marriage. Bancroft v. Bancroft, 154 Vt. 442, 578 A.2d 114 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        When one spouse obtains a professional degree during the marriage, but the marriage ends before the benefits of the degree can be realized, the future value of the professional degree is relevant factor to be considered in reaching a just and equitable maintenance award. Downs v. Downs, 154 Vt. 161, 574 A.2d 156 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Reasonable basis for trial court's award of rehabilitative maintenance for five years existed where wife's career had been set back by relocation to further husband's career; rehabilitative maintenance would help equalize the parties' financial status and provide for wife's reasonable needs in light of standard of living established during marriage. Bancroft v. Bancroft, 154 Vt. 442, 578 A.2d 114 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        While it is within the trial court's discretion to terminate maintenance payments upon remarriage, remarriage is not one of the factors the trial court is statutorily mandated to consider and does not automatically justify a termination of such payments. Johnson v. Johnson, 155 Vt. 36, 580 A.2d 503 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's failure to provide for termination of maintenance award upon wife's remarriage was not an abuse of discretion; remarriage would not necessarily improve her financial security and husband could seek modification of the order if remarriage did increase her income so that a real and substantial change of circumstances was present. Johnson v. Johnson, 155 Vt. 36, 580 A.2d 503 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where trial court erroneously considered the increase in earning potential made possible by a professional degree earned during the marriage as an asset of the marital property and maintenance award for trial court's determination of increased earning potential as a relevant factor in maintenance award. Downs v. Downs, 154 Vt. 161, 574 A.2d 156 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant failed to show that no reasonable basis existed to support trial court's award of maintenance to defendant, where the trial court gave due consideration to inter alia, the property distribution made, defendant's future earning capacity, the parties' joint and the individual debts, plaintiff's ability to pay, and the stand of living established during the marriage. Coor v. Coor, 155 Vt. 32, 580 A.2d 500 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Need for spousal support must be judged not in relation to subsistence, but in relation to standard of living established during marriage. Klein v. Klein, 150 Vt. 466, 555 A.2d 382 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's failure to consider income from law practice was abuse of discretion, where law practice was not considered in property distribution. Klein v. Klein, 150 Vt. 466, 555 A.2d 382 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that husband was potentially prosperous was not determinative of the amount of the maintenance award, since future earning are relevant only to the ability to pay the assessed amount. Naumann v. Kurz, 152 Vt. 355, 566 A.2d 1342 (1989).

        Reasonable needs are to be determined in light of standard of living established during marriage. Clapp v. Clapp, 163 Vt. 15, 653 A.2d 72 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Reference to reasonable needs in this section should not be looked at in relation to subsistence; the critical comparison is to the standard of living established during the marriage since spousal maintenance is intended to correct the vast inequality of the income resulting from divorce and to equalize the standard of living of the parties for an appropriate period of time. Strauss v. Strauss, 160 Vt. 335, 628 A.2d 552 (1993).

       <p>
        Because the family court is required to consider the property division when determining whether the spouse seeking maintenance has sufficient property and/or income to meet his or her reasonable needs following divorce, remand on the property division requires a remand on the maintenance decision. Boisclair v. Boisclair, 176 Vt. 646, 852 A.2d 617 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a divorce action, in light of the property settlement, the court did not abuse its discretion in failing to award maintenance to wife, who received sufficient cash to pay her attorney's fees, purchase a home worth approximately $200,000, and still invest $1,000,000. The income stream from that investment, combined with $18,000 per year in child support to provide for her child's needs, should have allowed wife a very comfortable standard of living. Cabot v. Cabot, 166 Vt. 485, 697 A.2d 644 (1997).

       </p>
       <p>
        In making decision regarding maintenance, trial court must consider property division between parties, and any change in property settlement necessitates reexamination of award of maintenance. Cleverly v. Cleverly, 151 Vt. 351, 561 A.2d 99 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        An award of property in lieu of maintenance is within the discretion of the trial court; however, such discretion is not unfettered. Naumann v. Kurz, 152 Vt. 355, 566 A.2d 1342 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        While property distribution is to be considered in deciding on a maintenance award, that factor was not intended to require that factor was not intended to require that nonincome producing property awarded to a party can be used in lieu of maintenance unless it clearly appears that the property was above and beyond that awarded as an equitable distribution of the assets of the parties. Naumann v. Kurz, 152 Vt. 355, 566 A.2d 1342 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Property division and maintenance awards are closely related under statutory scheme and court must give due consideration to both; the court may, in its sound discretion, conclude that significant amounts of both property and maintenance should be awarded.

       <p>
        If cost-of-living adjustments to a permanent maintenance award are to be every third year, they should adjust based on the inflationary changes over the intervening three year period. Molleur v. Molleur, 191 Vt. 202, 44 A.3d 763 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no single way to comply with the requirement that in applying an automatic inflation adjustment to a permanent maintenance award, the payor's income be considered. Molleur v. Molleur, 191 Vt. 202, 44 A.3d 763 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Conflicting escalation clauses in a modification order rendered future adjustments unworkable. While the trial court must consider inflation with relation to the cost of living when fashioning a maintenance order, the order must clearly articulate the formula for doing so. Braun v. Greenblatt, 182 Vt. 29, 927 A.2d 782 (June 15, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under 15 V.S.A.
        §
        752(b)(7), the trial court must consider inflation with relation to the cost of living when fashioning a maintenance order, and the trial court's failure to do so without a valid reason is cause for reversal and remand on this issue. Bell v. Bell, 162 Vt. 192, 643 A.2d 846 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Escalation clause in maintenance award, regardless of particular factor escalation is based upon, is not an authorization for a prospective modification without requisite showing of real, substantial and unanticipated change of circumstances. Chaker v. Chaker, 155 Vt. 20, 581 A.2d 737 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse its wide discretion to fashion maintenance award by trying escalation clause to defendant's income; since award was based on wife's contribution as well as her support needs, it was appropriate that maintenance increase in relation to defendant's enhanced standard of living, and in light of history of acrimony between parties and defendant's noncompliance with earlier orders, escalation clause would give wife a secure starting point from which defendant could, at a later date, argue the award had become unfair. Chaker v. Chaker, 155 Vt. 20, 581 A.2d 737 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        An automatic adjustment provision in an order for spousal maintenance or child support, which provides for changes in the cost of living, does not constitute an invalid modification of that order; rather, it is merely a practical means of assuring that the buying power of the original orders continues to be available. Roya v. Roya, 145 Vt. 488, 494 A.2d 132 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        When an order for child support or spousal maintenance which includes an automatic adjustment provision providing for changes in the cost of living should set forth a simple and workable formula which can be used each year to determine what the change in the payments will be; the formula must provide for adjustments to be made in a manner which is based on readily obtainable information, and should also provide for situations in which the payor's income does not keep pace with inflationary increases in the cost of living. Roya v. Roya, 145 Vt. 488, 494 A.2d 132 (1985).

        Award of nominal maintenance was within the trial court's discretion when the trial court imposed the nominal maintenance award in the event unanticipated circumstances justified a later maintenance award -- specifically that the husband would come out of retirement and again begin earning substantial income. Felis v. Felis, 193 Vt. 555, 72 A.3d 874 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the family court made a combined property and maintenance award that provided the wife with an income stream of essentially the same amount per month from the date of the divorce and indefinitely thereafter, the awards were to be viewed as a package. The family court did this by providing the full monthly amount through maintenance until the anticipated date of the husband's retirement and thereafter through retirement pension income supplemented by a small amount of maintenance. Molleur v. Molleur, 191 Vt. 202, 44 A.3d 763 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court did not err in awarding permanent maintenance to the wife. The evidence plainly demonstrated that the wife had extremely limited financial prospects, in marked contrast to the husband, and would need financial assistance to live independently or even approach the standard of living established during the marriage. Molleur v. Molleur, 191 Vt. 202, 44 A.3d 763 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court was required to amend its automatic inflation-adjustment provision, which stated that the $500 permanent maintenance award to the wife be increased automatically every three years "by 7.5%, or 3 times the annual CPI index for the most recent year, whichever is greater." The family court's formula did not actually track inflationary increases in the cost of living and did not take into account the possibility that the husband's income might fail to keep pace with the inflationary increases. Molleur v. Molleur, 191 Vt. 202, 44 A.3d 763 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court plainly relied on its property allocation in declining to award spousal maintenance to defendant; it noted that she had received a favorable apportionment of the assets of the marriage. In view of the court's determination that the family court erred in apportioning the couple's property, the maintenance decision had to be vacated and remanded. DeLeonardis v. Page, 188 Vt. 94, 998 A.2d 1072 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a divorce case, the husband had a good prospect of continuing to grow his business and, therefore, his income, while the wife's opportunities for advancement were very limited. Because the trial court considered the 13-year length of the marriage, the role the wife played during the marriage, and the income she was likely to obtain in relation to the standard of living set in the marriage, and designed an award to achieve the appropriate purposes of maintenance, the time-limited award of maintenance to the wife was just in light of all the facts and circumstances of this case and within the trial court's discretion. Gravel v. Gravel, 186 Vt. 250, 980 A.2d 242 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        After excluding the property award from husband's monthly expenses, the trial court did roughly equalize the parties' living standards in its maintenance award to the wife; offsetting the husband's property equalization payments against maintenance would give the husband, who had been awarded the entire ownership of his business, double credit for paying his obligation. Further, because of the increased cost of maintaining two households post-divorce, it was only reasonable that both parties had to lower their expenses and standard of living; while the reasonable needs of a party were determined in light of the standard of living established during the marriage, if the income of the parties was unable to support that standard of living, both parties had to lower their expenses and adjust accordingly. Gravel v. Gravel, 186 Vt. 250, 980 A.2d 242 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no merit to a husband's argument that the trial court erred in not awarding the wife ownership of his business in lieu of maintenance. While the family court had the discretion to make an award of property in lieu of maintenance, it was not required to do so; here, the trial court could have concluded that leaving the husband and the wife joined in a business relationship was untenable. Gravel v. Gravel, 186 Vt. 250, 980 A.2d 242 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Wife had failed to show that the family court abused its broad discretion in arriving at its maintenance award. For the most part, the wife failed to direct the trial court to the maintenance issues she raised for the first time in her cross-appeal. Drumheller v. Drumheller, 185 Vt. 417, 972 A.2d 176 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where husband was awarded stock options worth over $1,400,000, many of which were vested, and it was reasonable to expect that these assets would earn income, this income was required to be considered in determining an appropriate maintenance award. Golden v. Cooper-Ellis, 181 Vt. 359, 924 A.2d 19 (March 2, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the family court awarded no child support but awarded spousal support up to specified dates, the court's failure to make a separate child support award made it impossible to determine the amount actually intended for maintenance, and whether there was a reasonable basis to support it. Weaver v. Weaver, 173 Vt. 512, 790 A.2d 1125 (mem.) (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court did not abuse its discretion in limiting wife's award of permanent maintenance to payment of her health insurance; there was no need for precise specification of the parties' living standard and, contrary to wife's argument, court did consider interrelationship between its property award and the need for maintenance. Stalb v. Stalb, 168 Vt. 235, 719 A.2d 421 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court did not abuse its discretion in denying mother permanent maintenance and awarding her rehabilitative maintenance for a period of eight years, where mother was an intelligent and sophisticated person who had been able to develop business skills outside of home, was still relatively young and not burdened by ill health, standard of living during marriage had been modest, and court concluded that mother would eventually succeed on her own, either in her own business or other employment, to achieve an independent middle class lifestyle. Begins v. Begins, 168 Vt. 298, 721 A.2d 469 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not exceed its discretion in declining to award spousal maintenance to defendant based on its conclusion that maintenance was inappropriate since standard of living enjoyed by both parties exceeded that experienced during majority of marriage, and since there was no significant disparity in earning potential between parties. Wall v. Moore, 167 Vt. 580, 704 A.2d 775 (mem.) (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was a reasonable basis for the court's decision to award maintenance and findings regarding the reasonable needs of plaintiff were sufficient to support a mere $500 a month maintenance award because plaintiff's need to resort to public assistance demonstrated an obvious lack of personal income, property, or both, thereby justifying a maintenance award under 15 V.S.A.

        Where plaintiff submitted her child support guideline information she had supplied in support of the temporary award of $600 per month, the findings that the couple enjoyed an income of $65,000 per year during the marriage, that plaintiff required welfare assistance after the marriage, and that plaintiff's income would never equal defendant's were adequate to support the $500 per month maintenance award against an attack by defendant, who benefited from such a nominal award. Kohut v. Kohut, 164 Vt. 40, 663 A.2d 942 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        In context of divorce decree awarding wife 50 percent of husband's retirement and social security benefits, relevant provision established a clear overall scheme under which wife's 50 percent share of husband's benefits on the date of the 1984 order accrued, that is, was fixed and established as a base, and the word accrue was intended to refer to amounts credited to that base. Sachs v. Sachs, 163 Vt. 498, 659 A.2d 678 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Date of 1984 order was focal date after which
    retirement benefits attributable to the parties' marriage were to be calculated and set as a base, with benefits to be calculated and awarded upon the husband's subsequent retirement. Sachs v. Sachs, 163 Vt. 498, 659 A.2d 678 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1984 order, allowing wife to share in 50 percent of any increase or decrease in husband's retirement benefits accrued to August 1, 1984, and caused by market fluctuations, acknowledged that the future might enhance or diminish wife's base and the risks were to be shared; contrary to husband's argument, use of the word "fluctuations" implied growth. Sachs v. Sachs, 163 Vt. 498, 659 A.2d 678 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Husband's argument that, because 1984 divorce order treated his retirement benefits as income for purposes of determining alimony and not as marital property, wife was not entitled to any growth in the base amount was misplaced since ultimately it was the agreement terms, and not the characterization of the benefit, that determined the allocation of growth in the value of the retirement account between the date of the 1984 order and the date of retirement. Sachs v. Sachs, 163 Vt. 498, 659 A.2d 678 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The family court erred in calculating wife's portion of husband's retirement benefits as if husband had retired in 1990 at age sixty-five, rather than upon his actual retirement in 1993 at age sixty-eight. Sachs v. Sachs, 163 Vt. 498, 659 A.2d 678 (1995).
       </p>

        The family court erred in basing wife's portion of husband's retirement benefits on the $814 figure recited in the 1984 order as the possible or likely total monthly benefit, rather than on the total actual appreciated value of the account at the date of retirement; figures in that order were merely examples of potential appreciation at different retirement ages. Sachs v. Sachs, 163 Vt. 498, 659 A.2d 678 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Parties' opting for their own version of the deferred distribution or reserved jurisdiction method of distributing a spouse's pension, rather than the immediate offset method, negated suggestion that parties intended to match pre- and post-retirement alimony amounts; the election implied potential benefits and detriments to both parties, insulating wife from the vagaries of husband's decision as to when to retire, and husband benefiting in not having to pay an immediate lump sum to wife but rather paying a fixed dollar amount while employed and a post-retirement amount based on the fortunes of the retirement account. Sachs v. Sachs, 163 Vt. 498, 659 A.2d 678 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the terms of 1984 divorce order, Social Security payments to which wife was entitled should have been based on the value of the Social Security account on the date of husband's retirement in 1993 at age sixty-eight. Sachs v. Sachs, 163 Vt. 498, 659 A.2d 678 (1995).

        Trial court erred in requiring husband to pledge his interest in his law firm or purchase life insurance policy in equivalent amount in order to secure maintenance payments to wife in event husband died before his retirement age of sixty-five years because court order attempted to effect indirectly, through life insurance, what 15 V.S.A.
        §
        752 does not mandate directly, continuation of maintenance after death of party. Clapp v. Clapp, 163 Vt. 15, 653 A.2d 72 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, prior to separation, couple was living on after-tax income of approximately $130,000 per year and spending most of it, $33,000 was attributable to wife, both parties attained maximum vocational skills and employability, and husband's earning capacity would grow at faster rate as he approached retirement, trial court acted within its discretion in awarding maintenance of $1,000 per month to wife. Clapp v. Clapp, 163 Vt. 15, 653 A.2d 72 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's finding that defendant was entitled only to rehabilitative maintenance since she would be able to obtain some sort of job was not supported by sufficient findings because there was no finding that the job would produce an income that would enable defendant to live at the standard established during the marriage, nor was there any consideration of defendant's long-term contribution as a homemaker and primary caretaker of the children. Strauss v. Strauss, 160 Vt. 335, 628 A.2d 552 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse discretion by awarding maintenance to husband in divorce decree, equalizing parties' income during wife's lifetime while giving wife substantial assets, since wife was party through whom property was acquired and maintenance award balanced decree. Johnson v. Johnson, 158 Vt. 160, 605 A.2d 857 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining future value of professional degree in both amount and duration of maintenance award; court considered value of future benefits to be derived from degree, anticipated expenses to be incurred in obtaining those benefits, parties' incomes employability, duration of marriage, and most importantly, court focused on standards of living enjoyed by parties. Downs v. Downs, 159 Vt. 467, 621 A.2d 229 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly awarded permanent maintenance to homemaker wife in divorce proceeding, where there existed at the time of the first hearing a vast inequality between the parties' financial positions, wife's health was poor, wife's prospects for even remotely approaching husband's earning capacity were slim, and this section specifically permitted trial court to award permanent maintenance as it deemed just. Russell v. Russell, 157 Vt. 295, 597 A.2d 798 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Rehabilitative maintenance award of ten years' duration was not an abuse of the trial court's discretion to impose time limit on award where recipient, a former school teacher who had been a full-time homemaker during most of the sixteen-year marriage, would find her overall income eroded by inflation unless she obtained employment with an increasing salary. Johnson v. Johnson, 155 Vt. 36, 580 A.2d 503 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant failed to show there was no reasonable basis for rehabilitative maintenance award of $1,500 for a ten-year period to plaintiff who had an earning potential of $17,700 as a school teacher but who lacked sufficient income to provide for her reasonable needs in light of the standard of living established during her marriage to physician defendant. Johnson v. Johnson, 155 Vt. 36, 580 A.2d 503 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in award to 55-year-old, unemployed wife of permanent maintenance of $700 per month, despite finding that her monthly living expenses were approximately $1500 and earning potential approximately $1200; award was necessary to keep plaintiff in standard of living established during the marriage, defendant's earning capacity greatly exceeded that of plaintiff, who had not worked outside the home for many years and who would lose social security disability payments if she went to work and during marriage wife had substantially contributed to husband's education. Chaker v. Chaker, 155 Vt. 20, 581 A.2d 737 (1990).

       </h5>
       <p>
        There was no support for the trial court's decision terminating maintenance when the parties' youngest child turned 18, or a duration of nine years, because this duration was apparently based on the needs of the children rather than on the needs of mother; a child support award may end upon the children reaching the age of majority, but that temporal event is unrelated to the reason maintenance is awarded. Gulian v. Gulian, 173 Vt. 157, 790 A.2d 1116 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        In light of the purposes of maintenance - rehabilitation and compensation - the trial court's decision to tie the duration of mother's award to the age of majority of her youngest children, without more, was an abuse of discretion because there was no evidence that the duration of nine years would either adequately compensate mother for her contributions to the 14-year marriage or maintain her at the marital standard of living for a sufficient period. Gulian v. Gulian, 173 Vt. 157, 790 A.2d 1116 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        The termination of marriage does not automatically bar a later separate maintenance award. Poston v. Poston, 160 Vt. 1, 624 A.2d 853 (1993), cert. denied, 510 U.S. 816, 114 S. Ct. 66, 126 L. Ed. 2d 35 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although there are no definitive standards used to determine when maintenance should be time-limited, important considerations include the length of the marriage, the role the wife played during the marriage, and the income the wife is likely to achieve in relation to the standard of living set in the marriage. Strauss v. Strauss, 160 Vt. 335, 628 A.2d 552 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although a maintenance award based on an inaccurate predication about future circumstances can be modified, and it is theoretically possible to eliminate the time limitation and convert a rehabilitative maintenance award into a permanent award, the cases in which such conversion is necessary must be minimized in order to avoid continuing litigation that would frustrate major purpose of rehabilitative maintenance, which is to allow spouses to get on with independent lives. Strauss v. Strauss, 160 Vt. 335, 628 A.2d 552 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was entitled to some amount of periodic maintenance of indefinite duration where a time-limited award did not compensate her for her years as a homemaker, and was likely to leave her at the end of the time limit with an inadequate income to maintain the standard of living established during the marriage since her age, gender and lack of employment experience greatly limited her earning potential. Strauss v. Strauss, 160 Vt. 335, 628 A.2d 552 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        State courts do not have statutory authority to order maintenance to continue beyond life of obligor spouse, unless parties have agreed otherwise. Justis v. Rist, 159 Vt. 240, 617 A.2d 148 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Notwithstanding that it may be difficult to predict the exact length of time for recipient of an award of rehabilitative maintenance to become self-supporting, the court is required to impose a time limit on such modification, and if the period proves too short or too long, the disadvantaged party can seek modification. Johnson v. Johnson, 155 Vt. 36, 580 A.2d 503 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court's finding that husband's earning capacity was $40,000 per year was not sufficiently supported by evidence, so that court's maintenance award would be vacated where wife did not contest husband's explanation that $38,000 he earned in one particular year was due to tremendous amount of overtime, and that his earning capacity was $30,000 when working normal overtime. DeGrace v. DeGrace, 147 Vt. 466, 520 A.2d 987 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where unchallenged findings in divorce action depicted a vast inequality between the parties' financial positions, in that husband earned in excess of $20,000 per year, lived in the parties' jointly-owned house, which had a market value of between $45,000 and $50,000, and retained assorted assets totaling approximately $16,162, while in contrast the wife and her son lived in a low-income housing unit on a salary of $8,843 per year, trial court's order awarding alimony to the wife was proper. Buttura v. Buttura, 143 Vt. 95, 463 A.2d 229 (1983).

         26. Review.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        As long as the family court's order reflects that it considered the relevant factors under subsection (b) of this section, the court is not required to issue specific findings on each factor, and the party challenging the award on appeal must show there is no reasonable basis for it. Watson v. Watson, 175 Vt. 622, 833 A.2d 869 (mem.) (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court's order that husband pay wife $ 700 per month in permanent maintenance was not without reasonable basis where the court found that, since their separation, husband has maintained the same living standard the parties enjoyed while they were married and, in contrast, wife's limited income did not allow her to maintain even a modicum of a reasonable living style, much less the standard of living that was maintained by the parties at the time they were together. Watson v. Watson, 175 Vt. 622, 833 A.2d 869 (mem.) (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the trial court employed a process by which it set an amount of maintenance without considering whether father would owe any child support under the guidelines with this amount of maintenance, and only then determining that none was required by using this maintenance award when calculating child support, this methodology confounded any attempt to determine the component parts of the award for the purpose of appellate review. Gulian v. Gulian, 173 Vt. 157, 790 A.2d 1116 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        To successfully challenge a maintenance award, a party must show there is no reasonable basis to support it. Bancroft v. Bancroft, 154 Vt. 442, 578 A.2d 114 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        In divorce proceedings, the trial court has considerable discretion in ruling on maintenance, and the party seeking to overturn a maintenance award must show that there is no reasonable basis to support it. Johnson v. Johnson, 155 Vt. 36, 580 A.2d 503 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court has wide discretion in the distribution of marital property upon divorce, and the supreme court will affirm the decision where it finds reasonable evidence to support trial courts' finding and conclusions. Johnson v. Johnson, 155 Vt. 36, 580 A.2d 503 (1990).

        It was within the court's discretion to order a party to maintain life insurance naming the other party as beneficiary; however, Vermont law does not require life insurance to effect indirectly what 15 V.S.A.
        §
        752 does not mandate directly - the continuation of maintenance after the death of either party; where husband was ordered to continue an existing life insurance policy with wife as beneficiary until he was 65, it was not an abuse of discretion to decline to order more.

        Trial court acted within its discretion in not including the parties' premarital relationship or cohabitation period in calculating the duration of the marriage for equitable distribution and maintenance purposes, as the parties were unemployed or underemployed then and had initially kept their finances separate, and the wife was not financially dependent upon the husband then.

        Chapter 13 debtor's ex-wife obtained title to marital property, pursuant to 15 V.S.A.
        §
        754, when she recorded a state court's judgment awarding her title in a divorce action, and because she took that action before the debtor declared bankruptcy, the property was not part of the debtor's bankruptcy estate under 11 U.S.C.S.

         §§
        </span>
        541 or 1306; because the property was not part of the debtor's estate, the bankruptcy court lacked jurisdiction to issue orders which required the debtor's ex-wife to turn over rent she collected on the property after she obtained title, to order the debtor to return a shed and appliances he took from the property, or to award the debtor's ex-wife damages because the debtor moved livestock onto the property. In re Brooks, - B.R. - (Bankr. D. Vt. May 22, 2014).

       <p>
        In Condosta, the Vermont Supreme Court instructed only that while a divorce terminates a homestead right immediately, as well as a tenancy by the entirety, it does not instantly convey all the non-homestead property interests; although the bankruptcy court recognized in Farrar that a divorce decree distributes the marital properties in accordance with specified terms, it held that the divorce decree is not a conveyance instrument per se upon entry.

       <p>
        Before the court can modify a maintenance order, it must find that there has been a real, substantial and unanticipated change of circumstances; if the required change has not occurred the court has no jurisdiction to modify the order. Taylor v. Taylor, 175 Vt. 32, 819 A.2d 684 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jurisdictional requirements, with respect to parties, are the same in actions to modify alimony and support orders, as in the case of the original orders. Emmons v. Emmons, 124 Vt. 107, 197 A.2d 812 (1964).

         2. Power of court.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The family court abused its discretion in modifying the maintenance award based on the amount it decided that wife's new partner should contribute to her household expenses. Miller v. Miller, 179 Vt. 147, 892 A.2d 175 (November 4, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        The family court may not modify a divorce decree by awarding maintenance, where the original decree did not provide for maintenance; for this reason, a court may award maintenance in a nominal amount, to preserve the court's ability to modify the award later in the event of a "real, substantial and unanticipated change in circumstances," and, absent such preservation, the court cannot order maintenance at a later time, even if the financial situation of one of the spouses would warrant it. Arbuckle v. Ciccotelli, 177 Vt. 104, 857 A.2d 324 (July 30, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although evidence supported trial court's finding of a real and substantial change of husband's financial circumstances, reduction of wife's maintenance from $1,800 per week to $0 was beyond court's discretion. Stickney v. Stickney, 170 Vt. 547, 742 A.2d 1228 (mem.) (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        The power of Vermont courts to entertain a suit concerning an incident of marriage depends on the particular incident, and though child support and custody involve parental obligations which are continuous and unaffected by a divorce, so that a court may modify an existing order or enter a new order in the absence of a prior provision, there is no independent action for alimony once there has been a valid divorce. Grant v. Grant, 136 Vt. 9, 383 A.2d 627 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under Vermont statutes and at common law, the granting of alimony in any form is but an incident to the granting of the divorce, and unless the divorce is granted, the court has no power to grant permanent alimony. Grant v. Grant, 136 Vt. 9, 383 A.2d 627 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Orders for support are not final, and may be modified from time to time as circumstances require. vanLoon v. vanLoon, 132 Vt. 236, 315 A.2d 866 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        County court has same wide discretion with respect to modification of alimony decrees as it has been accorded in original actions concerning alimony and support. Davis v. Davis, 121 Vt. 242, 154 A.2d 463 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court having made a decree of divorce is not limited in its authority to make further decree to cases where decree of alimony is for annual allowances to be paid from year to year. Buckminster v. Buckminster, 38 Vt. 248 (1865).
       </p>
       <p>
        Authority of court extends to case where petition sought to have court give further allowances for support of minor children, and to grant additional alimony. Buckminster v. Buckminster, 38 Vt. 248 (1865).

        Where a trial court treats a foreign maintenance order as an enforceable Vermont order under principle of comity, court should analyze order as it would any other order under this section which permits revision of maintenance orders upon a showing of a real, substantial, and unanticipated change of circumstances.

        Where divorce decree gave mother custody of the children, the children later voluntarily went to live with father, with mother's acquiescence, and father, at that time, discontinued support payments, lower court properly awarded mother a judgment for the 31 weeks of child support payments encompassing the period during which father had custody of the children and was supporting them and did not make the support payments to the mother, particularly since father unilaterally discontinued the payments and moved to amend support order only after mother brought contempt action.

         6. Change of circumstances.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court's determination that a change in the husband's financial circumstances alone was a sufficient basis to establish a change in circumstances for the compensatory aspect of the maintenance award was error, as the trial court did not take into account the bargain that the parties reached when they married and decided that the wife would forego then-available career opportunities in order to raise the couple's children. Weaver v. Weaver, 205 Vt. 66, 171 A.3d 374 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Remand was required for the trial court to consider the husband's motion to modify his spousal maintenance obligation. In denying the motion, the trial court took an overly narrow approach to the "changed circumstances" analysis by basing its conclusion on whether the changes in question were "within the realm of ordinary foresight," and the trial court could have found under the correct standard that the husband's taking on reasonable housing expenses and the wife's getting a job that produced significant income substantially changed their respective financial circumstances in an unanticipated way. Zink v. Zink, 202 Vt. 10, 147 A.3d 75 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Receipt of the wife's anticipated Social Security benefits could not be the grounds for a change of circumstances that meets the statutory requirement. Likewise, the wife's age-based entitlement for Medicare could not be considered to be unanticipated. Mayville v. Mayville, 189 Vt. 1, 12 A.3d 500 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont Supreme Court encourages parties to raise changes in circumstances as soon as it is clear that they are occurring, but they must understand that the family court cannot speculate what the future will bring. Mayville v. Mayville, 189 Vt. 1, 12 A.3d 500 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court time is a precious resource that is already under great pressure, and the court cannot respond effectively to every change of circumstances that will inevitably occur; thus, maintenance orders necessarily involve some predictions of the future circumstances of the parties, to minimize the need to return to court for modification. For this reason, the statute requires changes of circumstances to be real, substantial, and unanticipated. Mayville v. Mayville, 189 Vt. 1, 12 A.3d 500 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court reached an appropriate balance when it denied the husband's request to totally terminate his maintenance obligation when he was laid off but reduced his maintenance obligation as of the date he stopped receiving unemployment compensation benefits. It reached a pragmatic result that minimized the need for the parties to return to court in the future. Mayville v. Mayville, 189 Vt. 1, 12 A.3d 500 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        In considering a husband's motion to terminate child support, the family court did not err in failing to consider the increase in the cost of his health insurance after his termination from his employment. In light of the motion, which requested termination of maintenance, not incremental reduction of the amount, the family court did not separately analyze instances where a party's expenses went up in relatively small amounts in relation to the overall financial picture; under these circumstances, the family court apparently did not find the difference in the husband's premiums, or coverage, to constitute a substantial change of circumstances. Mayville v. Mayville, 189 Vt. 1, 12 A.3d 500 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Modification of the purpose of the alimony award and the amount of the obligation cannot be made absent a finding of a real, substantial, and unanticipated change in circumstances. Failure to address this jurisdictional threshold was error. Braun v. Greenblatt, 182 Vt. 29, 927 A.2d 782 (June 15, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Absent an initial determination by the trial court, a finding of changed circumstances will not be made on appeal. Braun v. Greenblatt, 182 Vt. 29, 927 A.2d 782 (June 15, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        The family court may modify a child support or spousal maintenance order only upon a showing of real, substantial, and unanticipated change of circumstances. A change in circumstances is a jurisdictional prerequisite to such modifications, and the burden is on the moving party to establish the requisite change. Golden v. Cooper-Ellis, 181 Vt. 359, 924 A.2d 19 (March 2, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is recognized that, in circumstances where an obligor achieves a substantially lower income than the projection upon which a maintenance order is based, the family court can find changed circumstances. This does not mean, however, that the court must find changed circumstances if the obligor's income is underperforming the projection three months after the maintenance order is issued. Golden v. Cooper-Ellis, 181 Vt. 359, 924 A.2d 19 (March 2, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where husband's income history showed great volatility from year to year, but on average husband earned far more than the income figure on which the court set the maintenance and child support awards, the family court acted well within its discretion to rule that husband's proffer of reduced income was more a challenge to the divorce decision than a demonstration of changed circumstances and, as a demonstration of changed circumstances, was inadequate. Golden v. Cooper-Ellis, 181 Vt. 359, 924 A.2d 19 (March 2, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        The burden of proving change of circumstances lies with the party seeking modification. There are no fixed standards for determining what meets the threshold, and evaluation of whether or not any given change is substantial must be determined in the context of the surrounding circumstances. Miller v. Miller, 179 Vt. 147, 892 A.2d 175 (November 4, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        The family court did not abuse its discretion in terminating the maintenance obligation based on findings that the recipient spouse had a financial agreement with her new husband whereby he paid half of the household bills, and that she became half-owner of her new husband's house and, as a result, had a much lower housing cost than at the time of the divorce. Miller v. Miller, 179 Vt. 147, 892 A.2d 175 (November 4, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where father stated that he could no longer afford to pay maintenance due to his loss of full-time employment, in light of the request made by father, and the court's finding of changed circumstances, there was no abuse of discretion in the court's retroactive modification of father's spousal maintenance obligation. Sundstrom v. Sundstrom, 177 Vt. 577, 865 A.2d 358 (mem.) (October 21, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to obtain modification of a maintenance award, a real, substantial, and unanticipated change of circumstances must be shown. Lowery v. Lowery, 156 Vt. 268, 591 A.2d 81 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is within the trial court's discretion to order termination of maintenance payments should the recipient remarry or cohabitate; if anticipated increase in financial security does not materialize from the remarriage, he or she may seek amendment of the order terminating maintenance upon remarriage. Coor v. Coor, 155 Vt. 32, 580 A.2d 500 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's failure to provide for termination of maintenance award upon wife's remarriage was not an abuse of discretion; remarriage would not necessarily improve her financial security and husband could seek modification of the order if remarriage did increase her income so that a real and substantial change of circumstances was present. Johnson v. Johnson, 155 Vt. 36, 580 A.2d 503 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        No modification of maintenance order pursuant to this section was justified on basis of change in circumstances where departure of minor children from wife's household was foreseeable, decrease of husband's income level was self-inflicted, and wife's cohabitation with another man had been in existence at time of original divorce order and their sharing of expenses was not unanticipated. Gil v. Gil, 151 Vt. 598, 563 A.2d 624 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action to modify support order, trial court did not err by failing to apply all the criteria used to determine whether to order maintenance in divorce decree listed under section 752 of this title; the court needed only to assess the parties' current circumstances in light of their circumstances at the time of the divorce. DeKoeyer v. DeKoeyer, 146 Vt. 493, 507 A.2d 962 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        The loss of an anticipated employment qualifies as an unanticipated change of circumstances. Sylvia v. Sylvia, 146 Vt. 596, 508 A.2d 708 (1986).

       <p>
        When seeking to modify a maintenance or custody order, proof of a real, substantial and unanticipated change of circumstances is a jurisdictional prerequisite. Bullard v. Bullard, 144 Vt. 627, 481 A.2d 1049 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since an original maintenance decree issued in Vermont takes into consideration the financial capabilities and prospects of both spouses, it is only fair and reasonable that in considering a modification of that original order, a court examine the evidence relating to the change in financial circumstances of either or both spouses. Bullard v. Bullard, 144 Vt. 627, 481 A.2d 1049 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant's only allegation in support of his motion for modification of an order enforcing an out-of-state support order was his financial inability to comply with the order, his only proof of changed circumstances was his unavailing attempts to secure higher paying employment, his sole source of income had not changed since the order was issued, defendant had recently received a salary increase and his claimed expenses had not changed significantly, trial court correctly denied his motion. Mancini v. Mancini, 143 Vt. 235, 465 A.2d 272 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where record indicated that former husband seeking modification of alimony provision of divorce decree had terminated one of his jobs voluntarily because he wanted more time to himself, not because his mental and physical health did not permit continuation of his work schedule, the change in circumstances of the husband were not intervening and unexpected, but voluntarily made by him, and, there being no evidence to support a reduction of alimony based on impossibility of performance, fraud, or unconscionable advantage, the husband had not sustained the heavy burden thrust upon him as a party attempting to modify an order based on a stipulation and, therefore, entry of order by court modifying alimony provision because of changed circumstances was improper. Cliche v. Cliche, 140 Vt. 540, 442 A.2d 60 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Establishment of a substantial change of circumstances since original alimony decree is a jurisdictional prerequisite to power of a court to entertain an action to modify the alimony decree, otherwise the doctrine of res judicata prevents a judgment of modification.

        Where mother had a court order and a stipulation of father and herself giving her custody of children of the marriage following divorce, and the children to live with the father, with mother's acquiescence, mother could not claim that she did not have control over the actions of the children and she could not rely upon the change in custody as a basis for raising alimony award, and lower court's increase in alimony was in error where there was no other change in circumstances. Brown v. Brown, 134 Vt. 412, 365 A.2d 248 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        A change in circumstances and conditions since the original decree is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the power of a court to deal with a change in child support payments; otherwise, the doctrine of res judicata prevents a judgment of modification. French v. French, 128 Vt. 138, 259 A.2d 778 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where divorced parents shared burden of supporting minor children in mother's custody, the father paying $20 per week support, and the cost of items of support had risen, it would be manifestly unjust and not in the children's interests to compel mother bear the increased cost alone and lower court properly increased father's support payments to $30 per week, notwithstanding that financial resources of both parents had remained substantially the same, with the father's income being $74 per week. French v. French, 128 Vt. 138, 259 A.2d 778 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where order for alimony payments is made subject to further order of the court, allegation and proof of change in circumstance is prerequisite for any modification of the order. Hall v. Hall, 124 Vt. 410, 206 A.2d 786 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Change of circumstance alleged and proved, may still be quantitatively insufficient as a ground for modification of alimony order. Hall v. Hall, 124 Vt. 410, 206 A.2d 786 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        The remarriage of a divorced husband is circumstance that can be taken into consideration in considering modification of a support order, but this fact alone is not ground for reducing the amount of an award for support of children of the prior marriage.

       </p>

       </h5>
       <p>
        In the course of granting the husband's motion for downward modification of his maintenance obligation, the trial court erred when it considered the expenses that the husband had incurred as a result of his remarriage but concluded that it could not also consider the financial assistance his new wife had provided insofar as that assistance impacted his ability to meet his reasonable needs while also meeting the wife's reasonable needs. Weaver v. Weaver, 205 Vt. 66, 171 A.3d 374 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        In denying a husband's motion to terminate maintenance, the family court did not impute the salary of his current wife to the husband or require the current wife to pay part of her husband's maintenance obligations. It instead credited only her contribution to the household income; that is, it determined the effect of her income on the husband's expenses and ability to support himself while paying maintenance. Mayville v. Mayville, 189 Vt. 1, 12 A.3d 500 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Remarriage does not necessarily improve the spouse's financial security, and therefore it does not automatically justify a termination of maintenance payments. Remarriage is viewed as relevant to an ongoing maintenance obligation only to the extent it bears on the financial security of the recipient spouse. Miller v. Miller, 179 Vt. 147, 892 A.2d 175 (November 4, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Remarriage is viewed as relevant to an ongoing maintenance obligation only to the extent it bears on the financial security of the recipient spouse; this point is consistent with precedents under this section that substantial and unanticipated changes in the non-maintenance income available to the recipient spouse, or to the income available to the obligor spouse, can be a change in circumstances to warrant modification of a maintenance award. Taylor v. Taylor, 175 Vt. 32, 819 A.2d 684 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where husband alleged that because of her remarriage his former wife had access to such income and wealth that she no longer needed maintenance, her improved financial security was grounds for his motion to modify a maintenance award containing a remarriage provision. Taylor v. Taylor, 175 Vt. 32, 819 A.2d 684 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court erred in ruling that a maintenance provision, reducing maintenance to 50% on remarriage, should be treated like a liquidated damages clause that prevented looking at the financial circumstances of the parties at any time after the provision was adopted. Taylor v. Taylor, 175 Vt. 32, 819 A.2d 684 (2002).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Cohabitation by the recipient spouse can result in reduction or elimination of a maintenance award only if it improves the financial circumstances of the recipient spouse enough to substantially reduce the need for maintenance. Miller v. Miller, 179 Vt. 147, 892 A.2d 175 (November 4, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Changed circumstances presuppose a substantial improvement in the financial circumstances of the recipient spouse as a result of some measure of support by the cohabitant. Miller v. Miller, 179 Vt. 147, 892 A.2d 175 (November 4, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any economic benefit from cohabitation must be "unanticipated" to justify a reduction of maintenance. Miller v. Miller, 179 Vt. 147, 892 A.2d 175 (November 4, 2005).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in modifying the wife's spousal maintenance, as it found that the husband had suffered a substantial and genuine drop in income. Barrup v. Barrup, 198 Vt. 25, 111 A.3d 414 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        In considering a husband's motion to terminate spousal maintenance, it was proper for the family court to consider his portion of his pension as a source of income, for that was his money, and it was therefore a resource that he had from which to pay maintenance. Mayville v. Mayville, 189 Vt. 1, 12 A.3d 500 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont adheres to the majority rule that in considering the amount of maintenance to award, or whether to modify a maintenance order, the family court may include as income to the obligor any income derived from assets, including a pension, awarded to the obligor in the property distribution. Mayville v. Mayville, 189 Vt. 1, 12 A.3d 500 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court's order declining to terminate a husband's maintenance obligation did not impute minimum wage income and count unemployment compensation benefits "simultaneously," as the husband alleged. The family court estimated the husband's expected income based on how long he likely would continue to receive unemployment compensation and then imputed minimum wage for the period after unemployment benefits ceased. Mayville v. Mayville, 189 Vt. 1, 12 A.3d 500 (2010).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Because the husband's incarceration was not taken into account in deciding the original spousal maintenance order, the incarceration was "unanticipated" for purposes of the modification statute. Although the criminal prosecution and future retrial were known at the time of the divorce hearing, the hearing proceeded on the basis that the husband was working and producing income and would continue to do so; there was no consideration of how the result of the criminal trial might affect his income-producing capacity and for how long.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In denying a husband's motion to modify spousal maintenance, the trial court applied an improper standard when determining whether the husband's termination was unanticipated, as the question was not whether there was a reasonable possibility that he could lose his job in the future but whether subsequent developments departed substantially from the assumptions considered in the maintenance order. The mere possibility that he might be terminated in the future as a result of a warning letter he received a year prior to the final spousal maintenance order or a medical leave of absence that he requested, and his employer approved, was not sufficient to conclude that his termination was not "unanticipated." Atherton v. Atherton, 209 Vt. 505, 208 A.3d 603 (2019).

       In the case of a child support order issued prior to July 1, 1990 or a spousal support order, an obligee may request a wage withholding order when any amount due under a support order has not been paid within seven business days after the amount is due.

If acceptance of service is refused, the court or the Office of Child Support may serve the obligor by sending the petition to the obligor by ordinary first class mail and by certifying that such service has been made. In the alternative, the court or the Office of Child Support may provide for mail service as provided in V.R.C.P. 4(e).

        Where mother had the ability to pay under the statutory definition of "available income," her claim that there was no reasonable likelihood that the order for payment of child support arrears would coerce her into compliance did not strip the State of an available enforcement remedy, so long as it did not infringe upon mother's free exercise of her religion.

       <p>
        Under the strictest test, a state may burden religious liberty if the license suspension advances a compelling governmental interest and the state uses the least restrictive means to advance that interest, but mother must first make a threshold showing that the license suspension is a substantial burden on the free exercise of her sincerely-held religious beliefs.

        §
        812 is silent as to the factors a court should consider in relation to a name change petition but some factors other courts have considered include: (1) the child's preference, taking into account the child's age and maturity; (2) the length of time the child has used the surname; (3) the effect of a surname change on the preservation and development of the child's relationship with each parent; (4) whether the child might feel embarrassment or discomfort bearing a surname different from the rest of the family; (5) whether any negative association or social stigma has attached to either the current or proposed name; (6) the motives of the moving parent; and (7) any other factor relevant to the child's best interest. In re Wilson, 162 Vt. 281, 648 A.2d 648 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Before granting or denying an application under this section, the probate court should first determine what is in the best interests of the child, and then decide, on the basis of sound judicial discretion, whether the requested name change is warranted. In re Fletcher, 145 Vt. 209, 486 A.2d 627 (1984).

        In a partition action, the trial court did not err in not crediting defendant's argument that the property transfer was made in contemplation of marriage. The trial court credited plaintiff's conflicting testimony that defendant transferred the property into joint names based on the expectation that plaintiff and her family would be contributing time and money to the construction of a home on the property, and concluded that the evidence did not support defendant's position.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        When evaluating the best interest of the child, a presumption of validity attaches to the parent's decision concerning grandparent visitation and, to rebut this presumption, a grandparent must provide evidence of compelling circumstances to justify judicial interference with the parent's visitation decision. Craven v. McCrillis, 178 Vt. 476, 868 A.2d 740 (mem.) (February 4, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although a grandparent may have a close relationship with the child such that the child might benefit from contact with the grandparent, and the parent may deny such contact for no good reason, these are not the kind of compelling circumstances justifying interference with the parent's decision. Craven v. McCrillis, 178 Vt. 476, 868 A.2d 740 (mem.) (February 4, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to establish parental unfitness, the grandparent must prove that the parent's actions or the failure to grant grandparent visitation will cause the child significant harm by adversely affecting the child's health, safety, or welfare. Craven v. McCrillis, 178 Vt. 476, 868 A.2d 740 (mem.) (February 4, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Grandmother's presenting evidence of a child's boredom, unhappiness, and sometimes unclean condition did not amount to evidence that father's actions and decisions were adversely affecting the child's health, safety, and welfare; even evidence of father's one-time threat to hit the child did not rise to the level of child abuse sufficient to warrant judicial interference with his decision-making. Craven v. McCrillis, 178 Vt. 476, 868 A.2d 740 (mem.) (February 4, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        To accord with due process, an evaluation of the best interests of the child under Vermont's grandparent visitation statute requires that a parental decision concerning grandparent visitation be given a presumption of validity. Glidden v. Conley, 175 Vt. 111, 820 A.2d 197 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        That a child might benefit from contact with a grandparent or that a parent might deny grandparent visitation for no good reason are not the kind of compelling circumstances contemplated by the Constitution, rather, to overcome a parent's decision on grandparent visitation, a grandparent must show circumstances like parental unfitness.

       <p>
        Family court's award of visitation rights to maternal grandmother of plaintiff's biological daughter impermissibly infringed on plaintiff's right to decide what visitation is in his daughter's best interests, where there was no allegation or finding that plaintiff was not fit to parent the child, nor that the child would suffer significant harm without court-ordered visits with her grandmother. Glidden v. Conley, 175 Vt. 111, 820 A.2d 197 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court's rationale for entering an enforceable visitation order awarding visitation rights to the maternal grandmother of plaintiff's biological daughter - to eliminate the potential for plaintiff to restrict visitation due to his otherwise valid parental concerns - was far from compelling, and, standing alone, was not enough to sustain the decision; the order was precisely the type of decision making which, by disregarding and giving no deference to a fit custodial parent's determination of the child's best interests, exceeded the bounds of the due process clause, violated plaintiff's fundamental rights, and was unconstitutional. Glidden v. Conley, 175 Vt. 111, 820 A.2d 197 (2003).

    <p>
     Regardless of jurisdictional rules to the contrary, this chapter requires that the interests of child involved in a multi-jurisdictional custody dispute are to be addressed in the forum with the strongest ties to the child. In re Cifarelli, 158 Vt. 249, 611 A.2d 394 (1992).

     This chapter seeks to ensure that litigation regarding custody matters takes place in the state with which the child and his or her family have the closet connections. Boisvert v. Boisvert, 143 Vt. 445, 466 A.2d 1184 (1983).

     Requiring Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA) jurisdiction as a predicate to enforcement would defeat the purpose of the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (PKPA), which mandates that all states must enforce custody determinations made consistent with PKPA requirements, regardless of whether they could exercise jurisdiction to make a custody determination. Matthews v. Riley, 162 Vt. 401, 649 A.2d 231 (1994).
    </p>
    <p>
     Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act's (PKPA) preference for home state jurisdiction, established in 28 U.S.C.
     §
     1738A(c)(2), preempts the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA) to the extent the UCCJA otherwise might confer jurisdiction when another state is the child's home state. Matthews v. Riley, 162 Vt. 401, 649 A.2d 231 (1994).
    </p>
    <p>
     Jurisdictional requirements of Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (PKPA) preempt this chapter when the acts conflict; thus, unless child custody decree complies with PKPA, trial court lacks subject matter jurisdiction to modify or enforce original decree. Shute v. Shute, 158 Vt. 242, 607 A.2d 890 (1992).

     Where home state of child in custody dispute is not Vermont, Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (PKPA) is in conflict with, and takes precedence over, this chapter such that best interest of child may not decide jurisdiction. Shute v. Shute, 158 Vt. 242, 607 A.2d 890 (1992).

        Even assuming that a child was improperly brought or kept in Vermont, home state jurisdiction under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act is not nullified; it could form the basis for referring jurisdiction to another state, but does not invalidate jurisdiction. While the improper method by which a child came into the jurisdiction may cause a court in equity to refuse to exercise jurisdiction over a child, it does not deprive the court of its otherwise existing legal subject matter jurisdiction to determine custody. In re C.P., 193 Vt. 29, 71 A.3d 1142 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont could properly exercise jurisdiction over prosecution for custodial interference, where children were residents of Vermont at time of their abduction by defendant father, Vermont was children's "home state" under both Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act and Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act and Vermont family court was properly exercising jurisdiction over custody dispute, and information about parties and their situation was primarily located in Vermont. State v. Wootten, 170 Vt. 485, 756 A.2d 1222, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 934, 121 S. Ct. 320, 148 L. Ed. 2d 257 (2000).

       <p>
        Child-in-need-of-care-or-supervision (CHINS) merits decision was final and not void pursuant to a belated collateral attack. The family court had jurisdiction over the child-neglect proceeding and also had the ability to issue a CHINS decision pursuant to Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act emergency jurisdiction; thus, even if the exercise of emergency jurisdiction was "ill-advised," in the context of this collateral attack, the underlying order was not void as a matter of law on subject-matter-jurisdiction grounds. In re C.P., 193 Vt. 29, 71 A.3d 1142 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        By the time the initial disposition report requesting termination of parental rights was filed, the child had lived in Vermont for more than six months; thus, Vermont had become the child's home state, and the family court could exercise jurisdiction on this basis. It was not determinative that termination was sought at the initial disposition stage, rather than in a subsequent motion; the interest of New York did not preclude Vermont from adjudicating the proceeding; and there was no merit to the father's argument that a child-in-need-of-care-or-supervision adjudication was not final as to him because the allegations did not involve him. In re C.P., 193 Vt. 29, 71 A.3d 1142 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of parental rights is a determination of status and may be adjudicated when the forum state has a sufficient connection to the children, even absent minimum contact jurisdiction over a parent. Further, in this case, where the father was a citizen and resident of Sri Lanka and had never been to Vermont, exercise of jurisdiction was authorized by the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act and was reasonable given the strong interests of the state and the children in resolution of the father's rights as well as the lack of any conflicting jurisdictional claims by another state or country. In re R.W., 191 Vt. 108, 39 A.3d 682 (2011).

        Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA) defines "custody proceeding," but leaves the definition of the basic component "proceeding" undefined, leaving the matter to state law.

        Commencement of a child in need of care and supervision (CHINS) proceeding prior to a child's birth does not necessarily deprive the family court of subject matter jurisdiction. In re N.H., 179 Vt. 537, 889 A.2d 727 (mem.) (September 28, 2005).

        Vermont order modifying father's visitation rights satisfied the requirement of 28 U.S.C.
        §
        1738A(c)(1) of the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (PKPA), notwithstanding fact that mother and son moved to Rhode Island two months before Vermont issued order, where Vermont had jurisdiction under Vermont law when it issued orders. Matthews v. Riley, 162 Vt. 401, 649 A.2d 231 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont court was not bound to recognize and enforce Rhode Island modification of Vermont order regarding custody and visitation where the Rhode Island court failed to comply with the prerequisites for modification set forth in the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (28 U.S.C.
        §
        1738A(f)) because there was no basis for that court to conclude that Vermont had lost jurisdiction or was deferring to Rhode Island, and the Rhode Island court never requested that the Vermont family court decline jurisdiction. Matthews v. Riley, 162 Vt. 401, 649 A.2d 231 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont family court's order that mother show cause why she should not be held in contempt was valid where, although the mother contended that the Vermont family court could not find her in contempt of its September 1991 modification order because that order was superseded by the 1992 Rhode Island modification, the Rhode Island modification did not conform with the requirements of the Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act (28 U.S.C.
        §
        1738A) and, thus, the September 1991 order was entitled to enforcement. Matthews v. Riley, 162 Vt. 401, 649 A.2d 231 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        In light of the federal Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act's preference for home state jurisdiction, it is not normally in best interest of child for Vermont to exercise jurisdiction to determine custody of a child whose home state or recent home state is other than Vermont; moreover, Vermont is normally an inconvenient forum to determine custody of a child who has a home state other than Vermont. Columb v. Columb, 161 Vt. 103, 633 A.2d 689 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no jurisdictional bar to family court acting on father's renewed motion to modify child custody, where child had no home state on that date, and there was nothing in Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act or Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act to prevent Vermont's assertion of jurisdiction if grounds to do so otherwise existed; accordingly, matter was remanded for determination of whether adjudication of custody contest in Vermont was presently in best interest of child, and whether Vermont was the convenient forum.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        When a mother and a child had been living in Quebec for over a year at the time the mother filed her custody petition in a Canadian family court, and when the Canadian court considered its assumption of jurisdiction to be in the interests of the child based on his Quebec residence, the significant evidence presented to the court concerning his physical and emotional health, and the perceived risks of returning the child to the father in Vermont, the Canadian decision thus evinced at least two viable grounds for its exercise of jurisdiction under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act: as the child's home state and as the state where at least one contestant and the child had a significant connection, where substantial evidence concerning the child's welfare could be found, and where the assumption of jurisdiction would serve the child's interests. Miller v. Miller, 184 Vt. 464, 965 A.2d 524 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Having argued for recognition of a Canadian judgment on the ground that Canada rather than Vermont had jurisdiction, a mother had not waived any claim that Canada was the more convenient forum. The critical factors underlying a forum analysis were largely the same as those applicable to the issue of jurisdiction, to wit, the child's home state, significant connections with the forum, and the location of substantial evidence concerning the child's welfare, care, interests, and personal relationships, so the parties had been afforded ample opportunity to address the critical issues underlying the court's analysis; furthermore, the case had dragged on for too many years, and a remand to address the record evidence under a slightly different legal theory would represent a useless expenditure of time and resources and needlessly subject the child to continued instability. Miller v. Miller, 184 Vt. 464, 965 A.2d 524 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        For the exact reason that the Vermont proceeding met the Parental Kidnapping Protection Act (PKPA) condition, it met the identically-worded provision of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act. Thus, the family court had jurisdiction under Vermont law as required by the PKPA. Miller-Jenkins v. Miller-Jenkins, 180 Vt. 441, 912 A.2d 951 (August 4, 2006,) cert. denied, mot. granted, 139 S. Ct. 1273, 2019 U.S. LEXIS 1521,
    203 L. Ed. 2d 296 (U.S.
    2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where child in need of care and supervision (CHINS), and eventually termination of parental rights (TPR), proceedings were held in the Vermont family court, and it was only at a delayed disposition hearing that the parents' attorney first suggested that the parents were challenging the Vermont family court's jurisdiction over the child, and shortly thereafter, Florida declined to exercise jurisdiction over the matter in favor of Vermont jurisdiction, based on the child's best interest and Vermont's "closer connection with the child and his family," therefore, Vermont's Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act jurisdictional requirements were satisfied. In re N.H., 179 Vt. 537, 889 A.2d 727 (mem.) (September 28, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont was not child's "home state" at commencement of child in need of care and supervision (CHINS) proceeding, because child had not lived in Vermont from birth. In re D.T., 170 Vt. 148, 743 A.2d 1077 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        For purposes of determining jurisdiction in child in need of care and supervision (CHINS) proceeding, court does not need to weigh its state's connections against those of another; it either has jurisdiction or it does not, and provisions of Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act relevant to inconvenient forum and situations where custody proceeding is pending in another state are not factors in determination of discrete issue of court's jurisdiction.

        Vermont was home state for purposes of jurisdiction and jurisdiction was justified under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act (UCCJA) where when 1986 divorce proceedings commenced, son had lived in Vermont at least six months, and although mother and son moved to Rhode Island approximately two months before the September 1991 Vermont modification order was issued, Vermont was the only state that son had lived in for six consecutive months before modification proceedings commenced. Matthews v. Riley, 162 Vt. 401, 649 A.2d 231 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jurisdiction over subsequent child custody dispute was not established by mother's voluntarily submitting to jurisdiction of Vermont courts at time of divorce; jurisdictional defect could not be waived because subject matter jurisdiction cannot be conferred by agreement or consent of parties when not given by law, and neither Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act nor Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act specifically recognized waiver or agreement as a ground to establish jurisdiction. Columb v. Columb, 161 Vt. 103, 633 A.2d 689 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        To find jurisdiction over child custody proceeding, court must find that circumstances required by Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act and, indirectly, Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act are present at commencement of proceeding. Columb v. Columb, 161 Vt. 103, 633 A.2d 689 (1993).

        Provisions of the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act as to Vermont's continuing jurisdiction were met because the child had recently resided in the State and the evidence of the child's relationship with plaintiff's ex-partner was present there. Miller-Jenkins v. Miller-Jenkins, 180 Vt. 441, 912 A.2d 951 (August 4, 2006,) cert. denied, mot. granted, 139 S. Ct. 1273, 2019 U.S. LEXIS 1521,

        Vermont family court had continuing jurisdiction under best interest criterion of 15 V.S.A.
        §
        1032(a)(2) where although mother and son moved to Rhode Island two years before, father continued to reside in Vermont, where visitation was to take place between father, son, and numerous relatives, son lived in Vermont his entire life before moving to Rhode Island, and only mother's actions prevented visitation as scheduled.

        Bermuda was the most appropriate forum for continuing jurisdiction in determining custody of child who had survived accidental death of parents living in Vermont; Bermuda was where the child had been living with the maternal grandmother for thirteen months, it was the only forum that had access to evidence of the child's best interests, and it did not decline to exercise jurisdiction.

        In action involving modification of child custody decree, where it was found that the child did not have a home state under 15 V.S.A.
        §
        1031(5) at the time that father filed his motion and that Florida had apparently relinquished any claim of jurisdiction over the case, the Vermont court's exercise of jurisdiction was appropriate under 15 V.S.A.
        <span class="s1">
         §
        </span>
        1032(a)(4) because no other state had jurisdiction over the child, and it was in the child's best interests for Vermont to assume jurisdiction. Jackson v. Hendricks, 179 Vt. 549, 893 A.2d 292 (mem.) (October 24, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        In case involving termination of a guardianship order instituted in another state, where the family court made extensive findings regarding the child's best interests relative to the factors identified in 15 V.S.A.
        §
        665(b), and found that the child had developed strong relationships in Vermont, the court did not abuse its discretion in awarding father legal and physical parental rights and responsibilities, and granting mother and guardian liberal visitation rights. Jackson v. Hendricks, 179 Vt. 549, 893 A.2d 292 (mem.) (October 24, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although family court's findings were not adequate to support its conclusion that it had jurisdiction under Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, record did support a finding of jurisdiction where there was evidence that child and at least one contestant had significant connections with Vermont and that substantial evidence concerning child's present or future care, protection, and personal relationships were available in Vermont. In re D.T., 170 Vt. 148, 743 A.2d 1077 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's findings of fact and conclusions of law which briefly alluded to the availability of evidence in this state concerning the child's emotional, physical and social well-being, as well as the child's and father's significant connections with this state, were inadequate, and custody proceeding would be remanded for a determination of trial court's jurisdiction pursuant to all the criteria of this section. Duval v. Duval, 149 Vt. 506, 546 A.2d 1357 (1988), overruled on other grounds, Shute v. Shute (1992) 158 Vt. 242, 607 A.2d 890.

       <p>
        Provision of Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act allowing court to assume jurisdiction in the child's best interest if the child and at least one other contestant have significant connections to state did not give Vermont courts jurisdiction to determine merits of case alleging sexual abuse of child in South Carolina, where child's only connection to Vermont was attendance at a boarding school for a short period of time and no other contestant had connections to the state. In re A.L.H., 160 Vt. 410, 630 A.2d 1288 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where alleged sexual abuse of child by her father occurred in South Carolina, fact that child reported the abuse in Vermont did not give Vermont jurisdiction under Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act. In re A.L.H., 160 Vt. 410, 630 A.2d 1288 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where South Carolina was the appropriate forum to adjudicate merits of case alleging sexual abuse of child and that state had not declined jurisdiction, family court's order relinquishing jurisdiction to South Carolina would be affirmed. In re A.L.H., 160 Vt. 410, 630 A.2d 1288 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Father could not rely on underlying divorce action for jurisdiction over his motion to modify child custody; there was no subject matter jurisdiction for determining custody where New Hampshire was home state of child on date divorce action was commenced, it was not in best interest of child for Vermont to assume jurisdiction at that time, and Vermont was an inconvenient forum to determine custody of child. Columb v. Columb, 161 Vt. 103, 633 A.2d 689 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon accidental death of both parents, probate court had jurisdiction to enter emergency guardianship order giving maternal grandmother living in Bermuda temporary custody, but once purpose of order was accomplished, jurisdiction to determine future custody and visitation issues was no longer in any Vermont court. In re Cifarelli, 158 Vt. 249, 611 A.2d 394 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where Vermont was not the home state of the parties' child at the time plaintiff commenced a custody proceeding on May 1, 1981, nor within six months prior thereto, no parent or person acting as parent lived in Vermont after defendant and the child left the state in 1978, neither the child nor plaintiff had a significant connection with Vermont, since both had been absent from the state, other than for periodic, temporary visits, for three years, the Vermont court was not the forum where substantial evidence concerning the child's emotional, physical, and social well-being was readily available, although the child was physically present in Vermont, he had not been abandoned, there was no need for emergency protection of the child, since the trial court found that he was cared for and loved by both parents, had a custody action been brought in Missouri, where the child and his mother had resided since 1978, that state would have jurisdiction under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, Missouri had not declined to exercise jurisdiction and trial court's assumption that it was in the best interest of the child for the court to assume jurisdiction was contrary to the stated purposes of this chapter, Vermont could not have assumed jurisdiction over the subject matter of the petition. Peloso v. Botkin, 144 Vt. 461, 479 A.2d 156 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court which granted a divorce and awarded custody of the parties' son to the former husband lacked jurisdiction to modify the custody decree two years later where Vermont was not the home state of the child, it had not been his home state during any of the six months preceding commencement of the action to modify the decree, evidence concerning the child's present or future care, training and relationships, necessary to determine which parent should have custody, did not exist in Vermont, the child was not physically present in the state, no claims of abandonment or abuse had been made, no other state had declined to exercise jurisdiction and neither of the parents lived in Vermont.

        In light of the federal Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act's preference for home state jurisdiction, it is not normally in best interest of child for Vermont to exercise jurisdiction to determine custody of a child whose home state or recent home state is other than Vermont; moreover, Vermont is normally an inconvenient forum to determine custody of a child who has a home state other than Vermont. Columb v. Columb, 161 Vt. 103, 633 A.2d 689 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no jurisdictional bar to family court acting on father's renewed motion to modify child custody, where child had no home state on that date, and there was nothing in Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act or Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act to prevent Vermont's assertion of jurisdiction if grounds to do so otherwise existed; accordingly, matter was remanded for determination of whether adjudication of custody contest in Vermont was presently in best interest of child, and whether Vermont was the convenient forum. Columb v. Columb, 161 Vt. 103, 633 A.2d 689 (1993).

       <p>
        Canadian court's failure to follow the precise forms of Vermont law did not undermine its substantive conclusion that Canada was the more appropriate forum to exercise jurisdiction. Although the Canadian court did not expressly address such Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act considerations as the child's home state, whether another state had a closer connection with the child and his family, or the location of substantial evidence concerning the child's care, present and future welfare, and personal relationships, much of this information was in the record before it, and all of these factors undoubtedly informed the Canadian court's explicit conclusion that the retention of jurisdiction was in the best interests of the child. Miller v. Miller, 184 Vt. 464, 965 A.2d 524 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although decision whether to decline jurisdiction over a custody dispute is discretionary and thus subject to review under an abuse-of-discretion standard, family court must act in accordance with Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act and its overall purposes to eliminate forum shopping and assure that children's best interests are considered. Rocissono v. Spykes, 170 Vt. 309, 749 A.2d 592 (2000).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Family court did not properly exercise its discretion in declining jurisdiction over custody dispute, where two of three reasons relied upon by court were erroneous, and third reason was a single factor relevant to only one of several criteria court should have considered.

         6. Contempt proceedings.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In proceedings on motions for contempt filed by father against mother and a court-appointed attorney, the court acted correctly in considering the contempt motion against mother, despite its determination that New York offered a more convenient forum; since only the contempt motions were before the court, however, it was not making a "custody determination," and this section did not give it the power to dismiss the case in favor of jurisdiction in New York. Thompson v. Thompson, 171 Vt. 549, 762 A.2d 1236 (mem.) (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Having argued for recognition of a Canadian judgment on the ground that Canada rather than Vermont had jurisdiction, a mother had not waived any claim that Canada was the more convenient forum. The critical factors underlying a forum analysis were largely the same as those applicable to the issue of jurisdiction, to wit, the child's home state, significant connections with the forum, and the location of substantial evidence concerning the child's welfare, care, interests, and personal relationships, so the parties had been afforded ample opportunity to address the critical issues underlying the court's analysis; furthermore, the case had dragged on for too many years, and a remand to address the record evidence under a slightly different legal theory would represent a useless expenditure of time and resources and needlessly subject the child to continued instability. Miller v. Miller, 184 Vt. 464, 965 A.2d 524 (2008).

         7. Particular cases.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The case where a mother sought recognition of a Canadian court's custody order was one of those rare cases where the best interests of the child had to take precedence over the policy goal of deterring parental wrongdoing; thus, Canada was the more appropriate forum to resolve the matter, and the Vermont court should have declined jurisdiction in favor of the foreign forum. At the time of the father's original petition in Vermont, the child had been absent from Vermont for three years, and the Vermont family court consequently had no real evidentiary basis on which to evaluate the child's welfare or determine his best interests for purposes of a custodial placement; the Canadian court, in contrast, was home to both the mother and the child and had access to current information concerning the child's schooling, physical and emotional well-being, and attitude toward his parents. Miller v. Miller, 184 Vt. 464, 965 A.2d 524 (2008).

         1. Home state.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), after a court exercises temporary emergency jurisdiction, the order becomes final and the state becomes a child's home state if custody proceedings are not commenced in another state within six months. Although the court's decision in In re M.P. was not explicit on when the six-month period begins for obtaining permanent jurisdiction, the court clarifies now that the six-month period starts when the child first begins living in Vermont; this interpretation accords with the UCCJEA's definition of home state, which focuses on the state where the child has lived. W.H. v. Dep't for Children & Families, - Vt.
    - , 251 A.3d 41 (Nov. 20, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is the child's physical presence, not a parent or child's residence, domicile or subjective intent, that is relevant to determining a child's home state under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act. This is consistent with the Vermont Supreme Court's past cases, which have focused on the child's presence in the state to determine home state, and held that if the child has a home state, that state has jurisdiction to make an initial decision regarding custody regardless of the parents' connections to the state. In re M.S., 205 Vt. 429, 176 A.3d 1124 (Sept. 1, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutory language is plain: the home state for a child under six months is the place the child "lived from birth" with a parent or person acting as a parent; by adding the requirement that the child live with a parent or person acting as a parent, the legislature meant "lived" to mean more than simply being alive in the state; a short hospital stay incident to birth does not amount to "living from birth with" a parent and does not in itself confer home state jurisdiction. In re M.S., 205 Vt. 429, 176 A.3d 1124 (Sept. 1, 2017).
       </p>

        Child had no home state under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act when the termination of parental rights proceeding was commenced, as his short hospital stay in New Hampshire incident to his birth did not confer home state jurisdiction, and he had not been physically present in Vermont at the time the petition was filed.

        Neither New York nor Vermont qualified as a child's home state under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, as the child had not "lived from birth" in either. Although the parents resided in New York when the child was born, the father took the child to Vermont with the intention of residing there when the child was only a week old, applied for welfare benefits, committed to a safety plan for the child, and continued to reside in Vermont until the child-in-need-of-care-and-supervision petition was filed about two weeks later. In re A.W., 196 Vt. 228, 94 A.3d 1161 (2014).

        Vermont continued to have jurisdiction over the case after the mother and the child moved to North Carolina, as Vermont issued the initial child custody determination at a time when all parties were living in Vermont and had never relinquished jurisdiction, and the father continued to live in Vermont and the child resided there between October 2016 and September 2017.

        In a child custody case, the trial court properly declined to relinquish exclusive, continuing jurisdiction under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act, as it found that the pending motion was part of an ongoing course of post-judgment litigation that began before the mother and the child moved from Vermont, the central issues involved the father's access to information about the child and his parent-child contact, and the father remained in Vermont.

        Family Court had authority to act under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act. It had temporary emergency jurisdiction in that the child was living in Vermont with her presumptive father, who was unable to care for her, and her mother was incarcerated in Alabama; given the lack of a competing custody order or proceeding in another state, Vermont's exercise of temporary emergency jurisdiction became final, and Vermont became the child's home state.

       <p>
        Under the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction and Enforcement Act (UCCJEA), after a court exercises temporary emergency jurisdiction, the order becomes final and the state becomes a child's home state if custody proceedings are not commenced in another state within six months. Although the court's decision in In re M.P. was not explicit on when the six-month period begins for obtaining permanent jurisdiction, the court clarifies now that the six-month period starts when the child first begins living in Vermont; this interpretation accords with the UCCJEA's definition of home state, which focuses on the state where the child has lived.

       A warrant to take physical custody of a child is enforceable throughout Vermont. If the court finds on the basis of the testimony of the petitioner or other witness that a less intrusive remedy is not effective, it may authorize law enforcement officers to enter private property to take physical custody of the child. If required by exigent circumstances of the case, the court may authorize law enforcement officers to make a forcible entry at any hour.

    </h5>
    <p>
     Although abuse toward a spouse may serve as a basis for a finding of abuse to the children, thereby permitting a custody award within the context of an abuse-prevention proceeding, supreme court would not construe abuse-prevention statute to preclude courts, under any circumstances, from awarding custody to defendant found to be abusive toward another family member.

        Remedial statutes, such as the Abuse Prevention Act, must be liberally construed to suppress the evil and advance the remedy intended by the legislature. Construing the abuse-prevention statute in a way that gives credence to the gender-biased myth that domestic-violence victims provoke, and therefore deserve their abuse, would in no way serve its legislative purpose of providing victims with prompt, uncomplicated relief from abuse. Raynes v. Rogers, 183 Vt. 513, 955 A.2d 1135 (Apr. 18, 2008).

       <p>
        Trial court properly denied defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal of domestic assault. During a 911 recording, the complainant identified defendant and stated that she was beaten with his fists; the evidence contained in the 911 recording was supported by the responding officers' testimony and the photographs depicting the complainant's injuries; the evidence was sufficient to establish that by striking the complainant, defendant consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk of bodily injury; and the evidence admitted could reasonably convince a jury that the cut above the complainant's eye was a "bodily injury" and that the complainant was a household member. State v. Kelley, 202 Vt. 174, 148 A.3d 191 (2016).

        Evidence that two brothers-in-law spent eleven nights in the same household during a thirteen year acquaintance was not sufficient to find that they were "household members." Embree v. Balfanz, 174 Vt. 560, 817 A.2d 6 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a proceeding for a relief-from-abuse order, although they had not lived together or had children, plaintiff and defendant had a sexual relationship for five years and, thus, were "household members." Benson v. Muscari, 172 Vt. 1, 769 A.2d 1291 (2001).

        With regard to a relief-from-abuse order, the record did not support a conclusion that defendant's conduct in entering plaintiff's residence to retrieve his personal belongings placed plaintiff, from an objectively reasonable standpoint, in fear of imminent serious physical harm, as defendant had never physically harmed plaintiff, there had not been any incident of alleged physical restraint in almost a year, and defendant entered plaintiff's residence when he knew she was not there so as to avoid her.

       <p>
        Vermont's relief-from-abuse statute cannot extend the court's personal jurisdiction beyond the bounds of federal due process, as the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment operates as a limitation on the jurisdiction of state courts to enter judgments affecting rights or interests of nonresident defendants. Moreover, the provision stating that the action may be commenced in the county in which the plaintiff resides is fundamentally about venue, not jurisdiction; it does not purport to expand Vermont's jurisdiction over nonresident defendants.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Defendants may not collaterally attack abuse-prevention orders that they have been accused of violating, except on the basis of jurisdictional defects. Thus, defendant's claim that the family court improperly relied on the parties' stipulation, prohibiting him from abusing or harassing his estranged wife, incorporated by reference into the final relief-from-abuse order, rather than making appropriate findings to support the order, was an unpreserved and otherwise unavailing collateral attack on the underlying order. State v. Goyette, 166 Vt. 299, 691 A.2d 1064 (1997).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Orders under subsection (c) not only may require the defendant to refrain from abusing the plaintiff, but they also may require the defendant to refrain from interfering with the plaintiff's personal liberty, and may restrict the defendant's ability to contact the plaintiff or to come within a fixed distance of the plaintiff. In short, a relief-from-abuse order may prohibit otherwise legitimate conduct to prevent future abuse, and that conduct may serve as the basis of a criminal conviction for violating the order. State v. Goyette, 166 Vt. 299, 691 A.2d 1064 (1997).

       </h5>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for violating a final relief-from-abuse order, the court's broad definition of "harassment" in its jury instruction permitted defendant to be convicted on the basis of virtually any behavior that bothered the complainant and made the instruction reversible error. A specific definition of harassment, requiring the jury to find that the alleged acts were committed for no legitimate purpose and caused the complainant emotional distress, was not mandated, however. A definition of harassment could conceivably vary depending on the circumstances of individual cases. State v. Goyette, 166 Vt. 299, 691 A.2d 1064 (1997).

       <p>
        An order imposing a 1000-foot buffer-zone restriction did not deny defendant due process of law on the grounds that would be impossible for him to comply with the restriction, and that it would subject him to criminal responsibility despite his inability to comply. Benson v. Muscari, 172 Vt. 1, 769 A.2d 1291 (2001).

       <p>
        Judgment as to whether the imposition of a 1000-foot buffer zone, or some greater or lesser distance, was necessary to provide plaintiff and her child with an adequate level of security was one that rested within the sound discretion of the trial court.

       <p>
        Defendant testified that he kicked plaintiff's car door, grabbed her wrists, and threw an elbow in her neck in the process; he further admitted that he drove by her house four to five times in one day to monitor her whereabouts. Given defendant's admissions, plaintiff's testimony, and defendant's stalking-like behavior, the court did not abuse its discretion in determining that defendant posed a future threat of harm to plaintiff; contrary to defendant's assertion, the court neither ignored the testimony that plaintiff precipitated the argument by grabbing his dog nor was required to deny plaintiff's request for relief even if it found defendant's version of events credible. Raynes v. Rogers, 183 Vt. 513, 955 A.2d 1135 (Apr. 18, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence and findings were sufficient to support a 1000-foot buffer zone and firearms limitations based on the severity of defendant's attack upon plaintiff, the fact that plaintiff's two jobs made a floating zone necessary to adequately protect her and her daughter, and plaintiff's testimony that she had seen defendant in possession of firearms, and was uncertain whether he continued to possess them.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The statute clearly authorized the trial court to include plaintiff's child in an abuse-prevention order; nowhere does it state that the child must also be defendant's child or that the court must have found that defendant also abused the child.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The general authorization for the trial court to make orders it deems necessary to protect plaintiff, and her child, was sufficiently broad to allow the court to prohibit defendant from possessing firearms. Benson v. Muscari, 172 Vt. 1, 769 A.2d 1291 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        A restriction on defendant's possession of "dangerous weapons" in an abuse-prevention order was required to be stricken as being both vague and overbroad. Benson v. Muscari, 172 Vt. 1, 769 A.2d 1291 (2001).

       <p>
        The family court properly denied plaintiff's motion to terminate a relief from abuse order protecting defendant and the parties' two children where it found that plaintiff had not complied with conditions to reinstate visitation contained in the order, and that he exhibited no remorse for his violent and abusive actions towards defendant. Thibodeau v. Thibodeau, 178 Vt. 457, 869 A.2d 142 (mem.) (January 26, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Five-year length of a relief-from-abuse order was not unreasonable because there is no limit imposed on the duration of such, and they are required to "be granted for a fixed period." Benson v. Muscari, 172 Vt. 1, 769 A.2d 1291 (2001).

       <p>
        There was no basis for an abuse-prevention order where plaintiff's testimony primarily focused on her desire to deny defendant any visitation with his daughter, notwithstanding the fact that his visitation would be supervised pursuant to a prior divorce order, and she never testified she feared imminent physical harm from him. Coates v. Coates, 171 Vt. 519, 769 A.2d 1 (mem.) (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the family court is permitted to oversee division of property in the limited context of divorce proceedings, it is not authorized to resolve disputes between plaintiff and defendant as part of an abuse prevention proceeding.

       <p>
        In contrast to criminal or tort actions, abuse-prevention proceedings did not exist at common law, but are based entirely in statute. The abuse-prevention statute does not contemplate defense of property as an affirmative defense to relief from abuse because it is based on public policy considerations having nothing to do with private property rights and everything to do with protecting victims from intimate abuse. Raynes v. Rogers, 183 Vt. 513, 955 A.2d 1135 (Apr. 18, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Common-law defense of property is wholly irrelevant to a determination of whether an alleged victim of domestic violence requires protection from abuse. Raynes v. Rogers, 183 Vt. 513, 955 A.2d 1135 (Apr. 18, 2008).

        The critical question in abuse-prevention proceedings is not who was at fault, but who, if anyone, is in need of protection. Raynes v. Rogers, 183 Vt. 513, 955 A.2d 1135 (Apr. 18, 2008).

         13. Custody.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        To the extent a mother's ex-partner, a nonparent, contested the final relief-from-abuse order to assert a parentage claim over the mother's children, the abuse prevention statute was the wrong vehicle, as it is aimed at providing immediate relief for abuse victims, not at determining the parties' rights with respect to custody, support or property. Accordingly, custody determinations are better resolved in proceedings concerning divorce, legal separation, parentage, or desertion and support. Moreau v. Sylvester, 196 Vt. 183, 95 A.3d 416 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court properly issued a final relief-from-abuse order denying defendant, plaintiff's ex-partner, contact with plaintiff's children. The trial court found that defendant placed plaintiff and her children in imminent fear of serious physical harm through his back-to-back 2 a.m. forays to plaintiff's residence, during which the children were present while defendant banged on the door; the trial court also found that the supposed goal of these ventures - the welfare of the children - could have been accomplished far more reasonably than by appearing on a woman's doorstep at 2 a.m. after ensuring no other man was on the premises. Moreau v. Sylvester, 196 Vt. 183, 95 A.3d 416 (2014).

         14. Extension of Orders.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Court construes Vermont law to allow requests for extensions to be filed before or after the expiration of a relief-from-abuse order. Thus, plaintiff's filing, made on the second business day after the order expired, was not untimely. Forrett v. Stone, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (Mar. 19, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the absence of evidence or findings relating to the abuse underlying the initial relief-from-abuse (RFA) order, the trial court lacked a sufficient basis for concluding that extending the RFA order was necessary to protect plaintiff from abuse. Because the self-represented plaintiff's testimony consisted primarily of responding to questions from the bench, and because the trial court had taken the position that testimony about the underlying abuse was not relevant to the motion to extend, the court remanded for the trial court to take additional evidence. Forrett v. Stone, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (Mar. 19, 2021).

        Statute regarding service in relief-from-abuse cases provides that service of a complaint or ex parte temporary order or final order shall be in accordance with the rules of civil procedure, and may be served by any law enforcement officer. It does not require service by a law enforcement officer. Rollo v. Cameron, 194 Vt. 499, 82 A.3d 1184 (2013).

       <p>
        In a relief-from-abuse case, it is the court that initiates service of a temporary restraining order on the defendant, not the plaintiff. Return of service of the temporary order is filed directly with the court rather than being returned to the plaintiff's attorney for filing proof of service with the court. Rollo v. Cameron, 194 Vt. 499, 82 A.3d 1184 (2013).

        Defendant should have been acquitted of violating an abuse-prevention order issued in New Hampshire because in the absence of evidence that the final order had been served on defendant by proof of mailing it to his last known address in accordance with New Hampshire law, which had not adopted actual notice as a substitute for service of process in abuse cases, the State had not established that the final order was enforceable in Vermont pursuant to the statute governing enforceability of foreign orders.

       <p>
        Whether a different means of service might be more effective than those provided by statute or rule is not a proper calculus for the trial court in applying the statute governing enforceability of foreign abuse-prevention orders and the service requirements of the issuing state. It is axiomatic that the proper method of serving process must be adopted in order to render the service effective; where a statute points out a particular method of serving process, such method must be followed.

    1, eff. April 26, 2000, provides:
    </p>
    <p>
     "The General Assembly finds that:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(1) Civil marriage under Vermont's marriage statutes consists of a union between a man and a woman. This interpretation of the state's marriage laws was upheld by the Supreme Court in
     Baker v. State.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) Vermont's history as an independent republic and as a state is one of equal treatment and respect for all Vermonters. This tradition is embodied in the Common Benefits Clause of the Vermont Constitution, Chapter I, Article 7th.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(3) The state's interest in civil marriage is to encourage close and caring families, and to protect all family members from the economic and social consequences of abandonment and divorce, focusing on those who have been especially at risk.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(4) Legal recognition of civil marriage by the state is the primary and, in a number of instances, the exclusive source of numerous benefits, responsibilities and protections under the laws of the state for married persons and their children.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(5) Based on the state's tradition of equality under the law and strong families, for at least 25 years, Vermont Probate Courts have qualified gay and lesbian individuals as adoptive parents.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(6) Vermont was one of the first states to adopt comprehensive legislation prohibiting discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation (Act No. 135 of 1992).
    </p>
    <p>
     "(7) The state has a strong interest in promoting stable and lasting families, including families based upon a same-sex couple.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(8) Without the legal protections, benefits and responsibilities associated with civil marriage, same-sex couples suffer numerous obstacles and hardships.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(9) Despite longstanding social and economic discrimination, many gay and lesbian Vermonters have formed lasting, committed, caring and faithful relationships with persons of their same sex. These couples live together, participate in their communities together, and some raise children and care for family members together, just as do couples who are married under Vermont law.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(10) While a system of civil unions does not bestow the status of civil marriage, it does satisfy the requirements of the Common Benefits Clause. Changes in the way significant legal relationships are established under the constitution should be approached carefully, combining respect for the community and cultural institutions most affected with a commitment to the constitutional rights involved. Granting benefits and protections to same-sex couples through a system of civil unions will provide due respect for tradition and long-standing social institutions, and will permit adjustment as unanticipated consequences or unmet needs arise.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(11) The constitutional principle of equality embodied in the Common Benefits Clause is compatible with the freedom of religious belief and worship guaranteed in Chapter I, Article 3rd of the state constitution. Extending the benefits and protections of marriage to same-sex couples through a system of civil unions preserves the fundamental constitutional right of each of the multitude of religious faiths in Vermont to choose freely and without state interference to whom to grant the religious status, sacrament or blessing of marriage under the rules, practices or traditions of such faith."

       <p>
        In rejecting a partner's proffered justifications for denying parent-child contact with the other partner to a former civil union, the family court properly found that the other partner's sexual orientation was irrelevant. Because same-sex couples had the same rights and responsibilities as opposite-sex couples, the sexual orientation of the parents was irrelevant in a custody determination. Miller-Jenkins v.

     Legislative intent.
    </b>
    <cite class="vt-code">2011, No. 92</cite> (Adj. Sess.),
    
     §
    
    1 provides: "(a) On July 1, 2000, Vermont became the first state to provide same-sex couples the opportunity to obtain the same benefits and protections afforded by state law to married opposite-sex couples by enacting civil unions. In 2009, Vermont extended the right to establish a civil marriage to same-sex couples.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(b) Today, the United States is a patchwork of laws regarding the recognition of legally joined same-sex couples. While several states now recognize civil unions and same-sex marriage, most do not.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(c) Vermont law requires a person to have resided in Vermont for at least six months prior to filing a complaint for an annulment, divorce, or dissolution of a civil union. This long-standing rule is commonplace among the states and prevents parties from choosing a jurisdiction most likely to provide a favorable judgment. However, while an opposite-sex out-of-state couple who marries in Vermont can get divorced in the state of residence of either party, most same-sex out-of-state couples joined in a Vermont civil union or marriage do not have this option. Thus, there are many same-sex couples who established a civil union or married in Vermont who are no longer together, yet they continue to be legally bound with no recourse other than moving to Vermont and becoming residents.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(d) It is the intent of the general assembly in this act to provide access to a civil union dissolution or a divorce to nonresident couples joined in a Vermont civil union or Vermont marriage who are legally barred from dissolving the union in their state of residence, provided that the parties file a stipulation outlining an agreement executed by both parties that sets out the terms and conditions of resolution for all issues in the dissolution or divorce action. The provisions of this act pertaining to a divorce for nonresident couples shall apply to both same-sex and opposite-sex couples."

        "Acknowledgment" is defined as "a recognition of something as being factual" and it would reach beyond both the written letter and the legislature's intent in enacting the provision regarding dissolution of civil unions by nonresidents to hold that the "acknowledgment" must also include actual showing of an attempt to file in the other state. Thus, the parties, who had entered into a civil union in Vermont but were now residing in North Carolina, satisfied the "acknowledgment" requirement of the statute when they produced an affidavit from a North Carolina attorney stating that North Carolina would not recognize a civil union for dissolution purposes.
