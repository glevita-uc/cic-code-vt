        Fish and game board [now fish and wildlife board] had authority, under section 4084 of this title, governing authority of the board to issue rules regarding wild game, to promulgate regulation concerning tagging of game.

         2. Charge.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In prosecution for failure to tag a deer, information that listed time of offense as time when game warden apprehended defendant in possession of untagged deer rather than time when defendant shot deer was not erroneous even though the regulation required immediate tagging of deer when taken; all the state had to prove was that deer was not tagged when defendant was charged with violating the regulation. State v. Sullivan, 154 Vt. 437, 578 A.2d 639 (1990). (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Charging document in which offense charged was described as 'failure to tag deer' and which referenced regulation adequately apprised defendant of elements of offense charged and enabled him to intelligently prepare a defense. State v. Sullivan, 154 Vt. 437, 578 A.2d 639 (1990). (Decided under prior law.)

         3. Burden of proof.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Since the offense of failure to immediately tag a deer is a strict liability offense, the state was not required to prove that defendant knew he possessed a hunting license, knew he possessed deer tags, knew how to affix a tag, and knew anatomy of deer well enough to follow regulation as to placement of tag. State v. Sullivan, 154 Vt. 437, 578 A.2d 639 (1990). (Decided under prior law.)

         4. Necessity.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court properly found the defense of necessity inapplicable in trial for failure to immediately tag a deer; requirement that an emergency situation arising without fault of defendant was lacking as defendant's own conduct of shooting the deer gave rise to the obligation to affix tag. State v. Sullivan, 154 Vt. 437, 578 A.2d 639 (1990). (Decided under prior law.)

      </h4>
      <p>
       The proper care of distressed wildlife requires special knowledge and facilities not possessed by the general public. The purpose of this Regulation is to establish a licensed group of individuals collectively called wildlife rehabilitators to provide for the care of injured, debilitated, and in certain cases, orphaned wildlife so that such wildlife may be returned to the wild. Licensed pursuant to Vermont Fish and Wildlife Law, <cite class="vt-code">10 V.S.A. § 5215(b)</cite>, the wildlife rehabilitator is authorized to possess sick or injured wildlife and provide necessary aid. It is, therefore, possible to achieve more humane care and an earlier return to the wild.
      </p>
      <p>
       Nothing in this Regulation authorizes or is intended to authorize a licensed wildlife rehabilitator to practice veterinary medicine in violation of Vermont State Law, Title 26. However, a licensed veterinarian may apply to become a rehabilitator. A rehabilitator rendering gratuitous services in case of emergency should not attempt diagnosis or treatment beyond his or her level of skill and training. No member of the Fish and Wildlife Department shall become a rehabilitator.

Specifically, "[v]arious populations of light geese (greater and lesser snow geese and Ross's geese) have undergone rapid growth during the past 30 years, and have become seriously injurious to their habitat, habitat important to other migratory birds, and agricultural interests. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service believes that several of these populations have exceeded the long term carrying capacity of their breeding and/or migration habitats and must be reduced." The USFWS has set "forth regulations that authorize measures to increase harvest of certain populations of light geese." This rule implements this directive.

       A plan for the management of nongame wildlife species in Vermont includes all members of the animal kingdom: mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, fish, mollusks, crustaceans, insects, and other invertebrates; and is limited to native species not commonly taken for sport or profit, nor classified as domesticated.
      </li>
      <li id="t10c01sub02s25ol1b">
       Projects determined in accordance with the plan will be coordinated by the Nongame and Natural Heritage Program and performed by program staff with assistance from other Fish and Wildlife Department staff and cooperating organizations and individuals. Projects may also be performed on a contractual basis with qualified individuals and/or institutions.
      </li>
      <li id="t10c01sub02s25ol1c">
       The plan comprises four primary objectives: (1) inventories and status determination of species and natural communities, (2) species, habitat, and natural community management, (3) planning assistance and environmental review, and (4) outreach and education. Determination of project priorities will include consideration of species status and degree of threat, population and habitat trends, level of knowledge, public interest and support, availability of funding, arenas underserved by other institutions, and ability to make a difference.
      </li>
      <li id="t10c01sub02s25ol1d">
       Financial resources for project expenditures will be derived from donations to the Vermont Nongame Wildlife Fund, proceeds from sale of vehicle conservation license plates, federal funding sources, the business community, grants, and other sources authorized by the Commissioner of Fish and Wildlife.

Measures to reduce threats or enhance numbers in populations experiencing decline will be taken. In situations where a common species is negatively impacting other wildlife or humans, population control or management may be attempted. Species may be reintroduced when appropriate. Legal protection of nongame species will be enforced by law enforcement personnel. Collection of nongame wildlife for scientific research, education purposes, or for the purpose of using them as the subjects of art or photography shall be authorized by issuance of a Scientific Collection Permit.

     Species, Habitat, and Natural Community Management:
    
    Monitoring and management of populations will proceed if needed based on status determination and level of knowledge. Measures to reduce threats or enhance numbers in populations experiencing decline will be taken. In situations where a common species is negatively impacting other wildlife or humans, population control or management may be attempted. Species may be reintroduced when appropriate. Legal protection of nongame species will be enforced by law enforcement personnel. Collection of nongame wildlife for scientific research, education purposes, or for the purpose of using them as the subjects of art or photography shall be authorized by issuance of a Scientific Collection Permit. Other collections or take of nongame wildlife shall be authorized by Commissioner letter in addition to a valid Vermont Hunting License or Small Game License.

An Outreach and Education Specialist position will be integrated into the Nongame and Natural Heritage Program and help develop an education and outreach strategy. Activities to enhance nongame wildlife education will complement other Department and Agency efforts, and those of other conservation education groups. Networking with other organizations and teachers will be emphasized in order to maximize information exchange. Products and activities may include, but are not limited to, fact sheets, booklets, slide shows, videos, workshops, exhibits, and school programs.
