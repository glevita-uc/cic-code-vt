    In addition, there is the possibility a terrorist incident elsewhere could create difficulties with energy distribution within Vermont.
    These situations require a faster process than the required statutory process for obtaining a certificate of public good before commencing work.

     <p>
      In the event of an all-hazards event, the Governor may exercise any or all of the following additional powers:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t20p01c01s11ol11">
       To authorize any department or agency of the State to lease or lend, on such terms and conditions and for such period as he or she deems necessary to promote the public welfare and protect the interests of the State, any real or personal property of the State government, or authorize the temporary transfer or employment of personnel of the State government to or by the U.S. Armed Forces.
      </li>
      <li id="t20p01c01s11ol12">
       To enter into a contract on behalf of the State for the lease or loan, on such terms and conditions and for such period as he or she deems necessary to promote the public welfare and protect the interests of the State, of any real or personal property of the State government, or the temporary transfer or employment of personnel thereof to any town or city of the State. The chief executive or legislative branch of the town or city is authorized for and in the name of the town or city to enter into the contract with the Governor for the leasing or lending of the property and personnel, and the chief executive or legislative branch of the town or city may equip, maintain, utilize, and operate such property except newspapers and other publications, radio stations, places of worship and assembly, and other facilities for the exercise of constitutional freedom, and employ necessary personnel in accordance with the purposes for which such contract is executed; and may do all things and perform all acts necessary to effectuate the purpose for which the contract was entered into.
      </li>
      <li id="t20p01c01s11ol13">
       To seize, take, or condemn property for the protection of the public or at the request of the President, or his or her authorized representatives including:

      </li>
      <li id="t20p01c01s11ol14">

       To make compensation for the property seized, taken, or condemned on the following basis:
       <ol type="A">
        <li id="t20p01c01s11ol15A">
         In case property is taken for temporary use, the Governor, at the time of the taking, shall fix the amount of compensation to be paid for the property, and in case the property is returned to the owner in a damaged condition or shall not be returned to the owner, the Governor shall fix the amount of compensation to be paid for the damage or failure to return. Whenever the Governor deems it advisable for the State to take title to property taken under this section, the Governor shall forthwith cause the owner of the property to be notified of the taking in writing by registered mail, postage prepaid, and forthwith cause to be filed a copy of the notice with the Secretary of State.
        </li>
        <li id="t20p01c01s11ol15B">
         Any owner of property of which possession has been taken under the provisions of this chapter to whom no award has been made or who is dissatisfied with the amount awarded him or her by the Governor may file a petition in the Superior Court within the county wherein the property was situated at the time of taking to have the amount to which he or she is entitled by way of damages or compensation determined, and either the petitioner or the State shall have the right to have the amount of such damages or compensation fixed after hearing by three disinterested appraisers appointed by the court, and who shall operate under substantive and administrative procedure to be established by the Superior judges. If the petitioner is dissatisfied with the award of the appraisers, he or she may appeal the award to the Superior Court and thereafter have a trial by jury to determine the amount of the damages or compensation. The court costs of a proceeding brought under this section by the owner of the property shall be paid by the State, and the fees and expenses of any attorney for the owner shall also be paid by the State after allowances by the court in which the petition is brought in an amount determined by the court. The statute of limitations shall not apply to proceedings brought by owners of property under this section for and during the time that any court having jurisdiction over the proceedings is prevented from holding its usual and stated sessions due to conditions resulting from emergencies described in this chapter.

Each party jurisdiction shall afford to the personnel of the emergency forces of any party jurisdiction, while operating within its jurisdictional limits under the terms and conditions of this compact and under the operational control of an officer of the requesting party, the same powers, duties, rights, privileges, and immunities as are afforded similar or like forces of the jurisdiction in which they are performing emergency services. Emergency forces continue under the command and control of their regular leaders, but the organizational units come under the operational control of the emergency services authorities of the jurisdiction receiving assistance. These conditions may be activated, as needed, by the jurisdiction that is to receive assistance or upon commencement of exercises or training for mutual aid and continue as long as the exercises or training for mutual aid are in progress, the emergency or disaster remains in effect, or loaned resources remain in the receiving jurisdiction or jurisdictions, whichever is longer. The receiving jurisdiction is responsible for informing the assisting jurisdictions of the specific moment when services will no longer be required.

      Because it is probable that the pattern and detail of the machinery for mutual aid among two or more jurisdictions may differ from that among the jurisdictions that are party to this compact, this compact contains elements of a broad base common to all jurisdictions, and nothing in this compact precludes any jurisdiction from entering into supplementary agreements with another jurisdiction or affects any other agreements already in force among jurisdictions. Supplementary agreements may include but are not limited to provisions for evacuation and reception of injured and other persons and the exchange of medical, fire, public utility, reconnaissance, welfare, transportation and communications personnel, equipment, and supplies.

    <cite class="vt-code">2003, No. 121</cite> (Adj. Sess.),
    
     §
    
    78, provides: "(a) The Vermont general assembly originally incorporated "The Trustees of the Soldiers' Home in Vermont" in No. 180 of the Acts of the 1884. Section 2 of the act authorized the trustees to "receive, hold, manage and convey such real and personal estate... as they may acquire by gift, grant, purchase or otherwise, for the purpose of maintaining in this State a home [for soldiers and sailors] under such conditions and regulations as the trustees may . . . prescribe."
    </p>
    <p>
     "(b) On January 15, 1887, the land upon which the Vermont veterans' home currently sits was conveyed to the trustees by quitclaim deed of the Trenor W. Park Home for Destitute Children and Women, which was recorded in the Bennington land records at book 56, pages 436-40. The deed conveyed land and buildings to the trustees in trust, subject to a right of reversion to the grantor in the event the property ceased to be used to house soldiers. If the property reverted to the grantor, then the grantor would be required to reimburse the state for the appraised value of any "betterments and improvements" the state expended on the property. Failing that payment, the real estate and buildings would become the property of the state of Vermont "for such benevolent and charitable uses as the Legislature may direct."
    </p>
    <p>
     "(c) In a decree dated May 27, 1964, the Bennington county chancery court granted the trustees' request to modify the terms of the trust created by the quitclaim deed. The chancery court decreed as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
     "'1. That Eliza H. McCullough, Laura H. Jennings and Trenor L. Park, their heirs, executors, administrators and assigns and any and all persons claiming under them or any of them, have no present interest in the land and premises conveyed to the Trustees of the Soldiers' Home in Vermont by deed of Trenor W. Park Home for Destitute Children and Women, dated January 15, 1887 and recorded in Book 56 at pages 436-440 of the Bennington Land Records.
    </p>
    <p>
     "2. That the Plaintiff, with the concurrence of the Attorney General of the State of Vermont, is hereby authorized to convey to Defendant, Mt. Anthony Union School District, also known as Mt. Anthony Union High School District (No. 14), an estate in fee simple absolute, in and to the lands described in Section 9 of Plaintiff's Petition, and as described in a certain Option Agreement between Plaintiff and Mt. Anthony Union School District dated the 10th day of January 1964.
    </p>
    <p>
     "3. That the Plaintiff, with the concurrence of the Attorney General of the State of Vermont, is hereby authorized to transfer its water system including its reservoir, pipe line system and easements to the Village of Bennington or to any other person or corporation upon such terms and conditions as to them shall seem proper.
    </p>
    <p>
     "4. That the Plaintiff, with the concurrence of the Attorney General of the State of Vermont, is hereby authorized to convey an estate in fee simple absolute or a lessor estate in any lands owned by Plaintiff and held by it under the aforesaid deed from Trenor W. Park Home dated January 15, 1887, upon which no betterments or permanent improvements have been placed at the expense of the Plaintiff by use of money donated by the State of Vermont or otherwise.
    </p>
    <p>
     "5. That the Plaintiff shall hold the proceeds of any conveyance pursuant to the foregoing authority in trust for the use and purposes set forth in its charter and in the aforesaid deed from Trenor W. Park Home dated January 15, 1887, and subject to further order of this court.'"
    </p>
    <p>
     "(d) Thus, the trustees hold title to the lands and buildings of the home, subject to the trust established by the original quitclaim deed, as modified by the 1964 decree. Under the terms of the decree, the trustees may convey title to unimproved land, with the concurrence of the attorney general, and must hold the funds obtained from the sale of land in trust for the purposes established by Act 180 and the quitclaim deed. If the trustees cease to operate the home for the benefit of veterans, then title to the real property would pass in accordance with the quitclaim deed, the decree, and any other pertinent provisions of law.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(e) The general assembly amended Act 180 periodically, sometimes expanding the board's powers and other times vesting additional authority in the state. In 1971, the general assembly renamed the corporation known as "The Trustees of the Soldiers' Home in Vermont" as "The Veterans' Home in Vermont."
    </p>
    <p>
     "(f) In the years since the board of trustees was first incorporated, the trustees have performed many essential duties for the home and the state, including:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(1) Overseeing the operations of the home.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) Setting resident admissions policies.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(3) Establishing committees necessary for the efficient and effective operation of the home.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(4) Raising, holding, and disbursing funds.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(5) Advocating for the home and its residents and otherwise seeking the best care and services for residents of the home.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(6) Selecting a commandant to serve as chief administrator of the home.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(g) In the years since the general assembly first incorporated the trustees, the state has been involved with and has contributed to the home in many ways, including:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(1) The home receives an annual appropriation which is recommended by the governor and appropriated by the general assembly.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) The home annually submits a capital funding request for long-term maintenance, construction, renovation, and infrastructure improvements to the secretary of administration to be included in the governor's capital request.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(3) State employees, hired within the state classification system, staff the day-to-day operations of the home.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(4) The commandant, as an "officer of the executive branch," is entitled to receive the minimum starting salary set forth in 32 V.S.A.
     §
     1003(b)(1)(JJ).
    </p>
    <p>
     "(5) The trustees are entitled to receive compensation and expenses for those days they provide service on the board pursuant to 32 V.S.A.
     §
     1010.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(6) The department of buildings and general services assists the home to plan for and implement solutions to long-term and more immediate capital needs.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(7) The home is statutorily "attached" to the agency of human services for administrative support pursuant to 3 V.S.A.
     §
     3002(b).
    </p>
    <p>
     "(h) By enacting 20 V.S.A. chapter 87, it is the intent of the general assembly to reflect the current status of the Vermont veterans' home and its board of trustees and to clarify ambiguities created by the many uncodified sections of law addressing these entities."

        §
        1004, making the State Employees Labor Relations Act applicable to the state police, because, when read in context, this section necessitates a finding that the board is bestowed with authority to determine whether charges are proved or not proved, as well as authority to review the actions of the commissioner challenged in the grievance to determine if they comport with collective bargaining provisions prohibiting discriminatory or disparate treatment.

        Trial court did not err in finding that a director of internal affairs acted consistently with the statute governing police internal investigations in forwarding the investigative report to the State's Attorney's Office. The statute requires the head of an internal affairs unit to immediately report all allegations to the county's State's Attorney unless he or she makes a determination that the allegations do not include violation of a criminal statute; here, the director noted that plaintiff's conduct might have violated two criminal statutes.

      It is the policy of this state to assist federal, state, and local criminal justice and law enforcement agencies in the identification, detection, or exclusion of individuals who are subjects of the investigation or prosecution of crimes. Identification, detection, and exclusion may be facilitated by the DNA analysis of biological evidence left by the perpetrator of a crime and recovered from the crime scene. The DNA analysis of biological evidence can also be used to identify missing persons.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        DNA sampling and analysis to assist in identifying persons at future crime scenes is a special need beyond normal law enforcement. Vermont's DNA database statute has as its stated purpose to assist federal, state and local criminal justice and law enforcement agencies in the identification, detection or exclusion of individuals who are subjects of the investigation or prosecution of violent crimes; these purposes are distinct from the normal law-enforcement activities of investigating particular people for crimes already committed. State v. Martin, 184 Vt. 23, 955 A.2d 1144 (May 2, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        DNA database statute is not, as a general matter, concerned with ordinary law enforcement, but rather seeks to use DNA to accurately and efficiently identify persons in a variety of contexts, including subsequent criminal prosecutions; these goals are beyond the normal goals of law enforcement. The statute also serves another special need beyond those stated in its language: deterrence. State v. Martin, 184 Vt. 23, 955 A.2d 1144 (May 2, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Initial sampling in the DNA sampling statute, taken alone, does not
    violate the search and seizure provision of the Vermont Constitution. State v. Martin, 184 Vt. 23, 955 A.2d 1144 (May 2, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont's DNA sampling statute expressly prohibits analysis of DNA samples for any but three narrow purposes: creating a profile for inclusion in the federal Combined DNA Index System and the state database; administrative purposes and protocol development, if all individual identifying information is removed from the sample; and identifying human remains. The intrusions occasioned by these uses are minimal and, like searching a fingerprint database, reveal nothing more than mere identity. State v. Martin, 184 Vt. 23, 955 A.2d 1144 (May 2, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Wrongful disclosures of DNA-based information are arguably more likely than discriminatory misuse, but that prospect does not render the DNA-database statute unreasonable under the search and seizure provision of the Vermont Constitution. The court presumes that the Department of Corrections will comply with the limitations in the regulation. State v. Martin, 184 Vt. 23, 955 A.2d 1144 (May 2, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        DNA sampling statute does not offend the search and seizure provision of the Vermont Constitution as applied to nonviolent felons, whether they are incarcerated or not. The statute serves special needs beyond normal law enforcement and advances important state interests that outweigh the minimal intrusions upon protected interests. State v. Martin, 184 Vt. 23, 955 A.2d 1144 (May 2, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        State may, in keeping with the search and seizure provision of the Vermont Constitution, require convicted nonviolent felons to provide DNA samples for inclusion in state and federal DNA databases. State v. Martin, 184 Vt. 23, 955 A.2d 1144 (May 2, 2008).

         1. Constitutionality.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Given the marginal weight of the State's interest in DNA collection at the point of arraignment, balanced against the weight of the privacy interest retained by arraignees prior to conviction, the provisions that expand the DNA-sample requirement to defendants charged with qualifying crimes for which probable cause is found violates Article 11 of the Vermont Constitution. State v. Medina, 197 Vt. 63, 102 A.3d 661 (2014).

         2. Right to collect samples.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Statute governing DNA samples entitles the Department of Corrections to collect the DNA sample of all incarcerated persons required to provide one and to collect one sample as a matter of course. State v. Bruyette, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (June 11, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plain language of the statute governing required DNA samples clearly contemplates that the DNA sample is to be taken by or at the behest of the Department of Corrections (DOC), and not any other agency or jurisdiction, because of the person's status as an inmate committed to DOC custody. A person who has a DNA sample collected by another agency or jurisdiction is not exempt from this requirement if DOC has not previously collected a sample from that person. State v. Bruyette, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (June 11, 2021).

         3. Number of samples.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Plain language of the statute governing required DNA samples does not distinguish between persons in the custody of the Department of Corrections (DOC) who are incarcerated in correctional facilities in Vermont and those who are incarcerated in out-of-state facilities; the statute authorizes DOC to coordinate collection of a DNA sample with an out-of-state receiving facility or to designate a time and place for collection out of state. As such, the statutory limit on the number of samples an incarcerated person must provide to DOC applies regardless of where the person is housed. State v. Bruyette, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (June 11, 2021).

         4. Particular Cases.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Because defendant, who had been convicted of burglary and three counts of sexual assault in 1990 and who had been incarcerated since 1987, was required to provide a DNA sample to the Department of Corrections (DOC) and there was insufficient evidence that his prior DNA samples, given while he was held in facilities in Minnesota, Florida, and Kentucky, were collected by or at the behest of the DOC, the trial court properly granted the DOC's motion to compel him to provide a DNA sample. State v. Bruyette, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (June 11, 2021).

        Plain language of the statute governing refusals to give DNA samples refers to the statute governing required DNA samples and not to any particular subsection therein; had the Legislature intended to limit the scope of the hearing to whether a person was convicted of a designated crime, it could have referred specifically to paragraph (a) of the statute governing required samples, but it did not. Accordingly, the scope of the sampling-compulsion hearing is broader than the rule announced in Ritter, and necessarily requires a court to consider whether a person is required to provide a DNA sample under any provision of the statute governing required samples.

        Despite the trial court's erroneous conclusion that the scope of the DNA sampling-compulsion hearing was restricted to determining whether defendant, an inmate who had refused to give a sample on the ground that he had previously given samples, had been convicted of a designated crime, it did not limit its analysis accordingly. Because defendant was able to present his arguments and evidence below, the trial court's erroneous conclusion about the scope of the hearing was harmless. State v. Bruyette, - Vt.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Fingerprinting statute plainly directs that the court require that a defendant who is sentenced to imprisonment submit to fingerprinting as a condition of probation. Thus, the legislature intended that a failure to submit to fingerprinting will be a violation of probation, punishable like any other violation. State v. Stell, 182 Vt. 368, 937 A.2d 649 (2007).

         2. Postjudgment fingerprinting
        </b>
        .
       </h5>
       <p>
        Plain language of the fingerprinting statute provides only probation, and, by extension, violation-of-probation proceedings, as the means to enforce post-sentencing fingerprinting. A trial court's fingerprinting order and defendant's resulting criminal contempt conviction, therefore, were in violation of the fingerprinting statute, and the contempt conviction had to be vacated. State v. Stell, 182 Vt. 368, 937 A.2d 649 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because of the specific authorization in one part of the fingerprinting statute for an order requiring a defendant to appear for fingerprinting at arraignment and the direction for only a probation order in the section of the statute dealing with those convicted of crimes, the legislature intended that the postjudgment requirement for fingerprinting be imposed only in a probation order and not by separate order. State v. Stell, 182 Vt. 368, 937 A.2d 649 (2007).
       </p>

        </b>
        .
       </h5>
       <p>
        There was no harmless error when defendant was convicted of both criminal contempt and a violation of probation for failing to appear for fingerprinting. An improper criminal conviction, even one carrying with it a minimal penalty, could not be harmless; wrongful convictions were precisely the sort of miscarriage of justice the court could not let stand. State v. Stell, 182 Vt. 368, 937 A.2d 649 (2007).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Fingerprinting statute unambiguously requires an individualized showing of good cause for the court to order fingerprinting in the context of a misdemeanor arraignment, and does not authorize a blanket rule pursuant to which courts may order fingerprinting at arraignment in all misdemeanor cases. State v. Grant, 211 Vt. 336, 225 A.3d 254 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the fingerprinting statute required an individualized finding of good cause to order fingerprinting and photographing at a misdemeanor arraignment, it was error to impose a condition of release requiring that defendant submit to fingerprinting when the State had presented no individualized evidence that could support a finding of good cause. State v. Grant, 211 Vt. 336, 225 A.3d 254 (2019).

     §
    
    27 provides: "(a) It is imperative that Vermont provide adequate training to both local and State law enforcement officers regarding the detection of impaired driving. Advanced Roadside Impaired Driving Enforcement (ARIDE) training provides instruction to officers at a level above Basic Standardized Sobriety Testing and proves helpful to an officer in determining when a Drug Recognition Expert (DRE) should be called. Vermont should endeavor to train as many law enforcement officers as possible in ARIDE. DREs receive a more advanced training in the detection of drugged driving and should be an available statewide resource for officers in the field.

     "(b) The Secretary of Transportation and the Commissioner of Public Safety shall work collaboratively to:

An imminent threat is not merely a fear of future harm, no matter how great the fear and no matter how great the likelihood of the harm, but is one that, from appearances, must be immediately addressed and confronted.

         Whether the decision by a law enforcement officer to use force was objectively reasonable shall be evaluated from the perspective of a reasonable officer in the same situation, based on the totality of the circumstances. A law enforcement officer's failure to use feasible and reasonable alternatives to force shall be a consideration for whether its use was objectively reasonable.

        </li>
        <li id="t20p6Ac151s2368ol1b5">
         When a law enforcement officer knows that a subject's conduct is the result of a medical condition, mental impairment, developmental disability, physical limitation, language barrier, drug or alcohol impairment, or other factor beyond the subject's control, the officer shall take that information into account in determining the amount of force appropriate to use on the subject, if any.

        <li id="t20p6Ac151s2368ol1b6">
         A law enforcement officer who makes or attempts to make an arrest need not retreat or desist from his or her efforts by reason of the resistance or threatened resistance of the person being arrested. A law enforcement officer shall not be deemed an aggressor or lose the right to self-defense by the use of proportional force if necessary in compliance with subdivision (2) of this subsection to effect the arrest or to prevent escape or to overcome resistance. For the purposes of this subdivision, "retreat" does not mean tactical repositioning or other de-escalation tactics.

       Upon application in writing of 20 or more freeholders or voters of a proposed fire district, the selectboard, after a duly warned public hearing, may establish such proposed fire district and define its limits. Such application shall contain a list of the powers mentioned in sections 2601 and 2603 of this title which the proposed district shall have and the district shall not have any of the other powers mentioned in these sections. Fire districts thus created shall be named by number in the order of their establishment. The selectboard shall file a certificate of its doings in the office of the town clerk for record. The selectboard may change the limits of a fire district upon a similar application and in like manner subject to the approval by the fire district at the annual or a special meeting of the fire district duly warned but any change in limits of a fire district may take place only with the consent of the majority of the landowners newly included within or excluded from those boundaries by that alteration. A record of any alteration of fire district boundaries shall be made by the town clerk. Only property contiguous to the fire district shall be the subject of an expansion of the boundaries of a fire district. For purposes of this subsection, a "public hearing" shall be a meeting of the legislative body of a town or of a fire district for the duly warned purpose of establishing or changing the limits of a fire district. Public notice for a public hearing required by this subsection shall be given not less than 15 days prior to the date of the public hearing by:
       <ol>
        <li id="t20p07c171sub01s2481ol1a1">

       If a petition signed by five percent of the legal voters of the town objecting to the proposed establishment or change of limits of the fire district is presented to the town clerk within 30 days of the date of posting and publication of the notice required by subsection (a) of this section, the selectboard shall cause the question of whether the town shall establish or change the limits of the fire district to be considered at a special or annual meeting called for that purpose. After the meeting, the fire district shall be established or the limits changed unless a majority of the voters of the town present and voting vote to disapprove of such establishment or change of limits. If a petition signed by five percent of the legal voters of a town objecting to a selectboard decision denying the establishment or the change of limits of a fire district is presented to the town clerk within 30 days of the selectboard decision, the selectboard shall cause the question of whether the town shall establish or change the limits of the fire district to be considered at a special or annual meeting called for that purpose.

      A fire district shall elect at its first meeting and at each annual meeting thereafter a clerk, a treasurer and a collector of taxes. Such fire district may elect a chief engineer and such assistant engineers as are necessary, whether or not they are inhabitants of the district, who shall rank in the order of their election. Such officers shall hold office until the next annual meeting and until others are elected. A vacancy in any office may be filled by the prudential committee. Such district at its first meeting shall elect a prudential committee which shall consist of three persons, who shall serve for one, two and three years, respectively. Thereafter at each annual meeting a member of such committee shall be elected for the term of three years. If the fire district so votes, two additional persons may be elected to such committee for a term of one year. A vacancy in such committee may be filled at an annual meeting, or at a special meeting called for that purpose, but the selectmen of the town in which such district is located may fill a vacancy in such committee until an election by the appointment of a resident of such district. When a meeting is not held on the second Monday in January, the officers of the district may be elected at a special meeting. The officers shall be elected by ballot if demanded by a voter, and by a majority vote.

     <p>
      A fire district may vote to adopt the town manager system in compliance with 24 V.S.A. chapter 37.
    It may vote a tax upon the taxable estate for the protection of property in the district from damage by fire; for the acquisition, construction, and maintenance of sewers and sewage treatment works; sidewalks; public parks; water works, water companies, and equipment and real estate used in connection therewith, including reservoirs and dams; for lighting; and for other lawful purposes.
    The prudential committee and collector shall have the same power in assessing, levying, and collecting the tax, as town officers have in assessing and collecting town taxes, including the collection of interest on overdue taxes. The prudential committee may expend such sums for acquiring, constructing, and maintaining sewers and sewage treatment works; sidewalks; public parks; water works, water companies, and all equipment and real estate used in connection therewith, including reservoirs and dams; and for lighting purposes as the fire district may vote.
    The committee may use and occupy such portions of the highways within the district as may be necessary for constructing and maintaining sewers and sewage treatment works; sidewalks; public parks; water works and mains, and for lighting purposes.

       The Historic Variance Appeals Board is created.

A Board member who is not a State employee shall be entitled to compensation and expenses as provided by <cite class="vt-code">32 V.S.A. § 1010</cite>.

The Board shall meet and consider such requests within 15 working days of the request being filed with the Commissioner. In deciding whether to grant or deny the request, the Board shall take testimony or receive information from the applicant or his or her representatives, and from Division of Fire Safety staff. A decision of the Board based on a majority vote of those members present shall be binding. The Board shall issue a written determination granting or denying, in whole or in part, any variance or exemption request, or permission to phase in compliance, within 60 days of hearing the request. If a grant is conditional, the condition shall be clearly stated in writing. Failure to act on a request within 60 days shall be deemed approval of the request, provided that the public safety and health is not imminently threatened.

        Where the fire marshal found combustible or explosive materials or conditions at a town dump, creating a fire hazard dangerous to life or safety, he could make reasonable orders for the remedying of same, even to extent of ordering material removed or forbidding persons from continuing to dump them on the premises if, in the exercise of his sound discretion, such action was necessary to eliminate the fire hazard. 1948-50 Op.

        In those cases where the department of social welfare had filed a lien for old age assistance furnished to the owner of a building, the department owned an interest in the building and was entitled to notice of the hearing. 1952-54 Op. Atty. Gen. 293.
       </p>
       <p>
        The rule applicable in cases of sudden emergency requiring destruction of a building, whereby the ordinary requirements of the law as to notice could be dispensed with under the police power because of the urgency of the occasion, was inapplicable to a proceeding under the section, which by its express terms referred only to a building or structure which had been in a condition sought to be remedied for at least one month. Nichols Electric Co. v. Fienberg, 101 Vt. 99, 141 A. 679 (1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a fire marshal had ordered the destruction of a building, and notice of a proposed hearing in relation thereto had been given to the treasurer of the corporate lessee in possession of the building just before the hearing was held, such notice was not reasonable. Nichols Electric Co. v. Fienberg, 101 Vt. 99, 141 A. 679 (1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an order of a fire marshal for the destruction of a building was not served on the corporate tenant in possession, and notice was not waived by it, the lessee was entitled to enjoin removal of the building under such order.

      <li id="t20p07c174s2900ol11">
       "Alteration" means a change to a public building that affects or could affect the usability of the building or any part of the building. "Alteration" includes remodeling, renovation, rehabilitation, reconstruction, historic restoration, changes, or rearrangement in the plan or configuration of walls and full-height partitions. Normal maintenance, reroofing, painting or wallpapering, asbestos removal, lead paint hazard reduction, or changes to mechanical and electrical systems are not alterations unless they affect the usability of the building or facility.
      </li>
      <li id="t20p07c174s2900ol12">
       "Ambulatory disability" means an impairment that prevents or impedes walking. A person shall be considered to have an ambulatory disability if the person:
       <ol type="A">
        <li id="t20p07c174s2900ol12A">
         cannot walk 200 feet without stopping to rest;

        </li>
        <li id="t20p07c174s2900ol12C">
         is restricted by lung disease to such an extent that the person's forced (respiratory) expiratory volume for one second, when measured by spirometry, is less than one liter or the arterial oxygen tension is less than 60 mm/hg on room air at rest;
        </li>
        <li id="t20p07c174s2900ol12D">

       "Blind" means the visual impairment of an individual whose central visual acuity does not exceed 20/200 in the better eye with corrective lenses or whose visual acuity, if better than 20/200, is accompanied by a limit to the field of vision in the better eye to such a degree that its widest diameter subtends an angle of no greater than 20 degrees.
      </li>
      <li id="t20p07c174s2900ol14">
       "Covered multifamily dwelling" means a residential unit for sale or rent in a public building consisting of four or more residential units if the building has one or more elevators; and a ground floor residential unit for sale or rent in a public building consisting of four or more residential units, if the building has no elevator. For the purpose of this chapter, "public building" includes, in addition to the definition in subdivision (8) of this section, a cooperative or condominium if the building otherwise meets the definition of "covered multifamily dwelling."
      </li>
      <li id="t20p07c174s2900ol15">
       "Historic building" means any structure that is listed in or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places or included in the State Register of Historic Places.
      </li>
      <li id="t20p07c174s2900ol16">
       "Maximum extent feasible" means the situation in which the nature of an existing building or facility makes it virtually impossible to comply fully with accessibility standards. In these circumstances, the alteration shall provide the maximum physical accessibility feasible. Any altered feature of the building or facility that can be made accessible shall be. If providing accessibility to individuals with specific disabilities is not feasible, the facility shall be made accessible to persons with other types of disabilities.
      </li>
      <li id="t20p07c174s2900ol17">
       "Primary function" means a major activity for which the facility is intended. Areas that contain a primary function include the customer services lobby of a bank, the dining area of a cafeteria, the meeting rooms in a conference center, and offices and other work areas in which the activities of the public or private entity using the facility are performed. Mechanical rooms, boiler rooms, supply storage rooms, employee lounges, or locker rooms, janitorial closets, entrances, corridors, and restrooms are not areas containing a primary function.
      </li>
      <li id="t20p07c174s2900ol18">
       "Public building" means a State, county, or municipal building; airport terminal; bus or railroad station; school building; school; society hall; hotel as defined in <cite class="vt-code">32 V.S.A. § 9202</cite>; restaurant; apartment; church or other house of worship; factory; mill; office building or other building in which persons are employed; store or other space in which goods are offered for sale at wholesale or retail; nursery; convalescent home; home for persons who are elders; or child care facility, provided that the term "public building" does not include a family residence registered as a child care home under 33 V.S.A. chapter 35, subchapter 1. "Public building" also means a tent or outdoor structure, place of amusement, barn, shed, or workshop, if normally open to the public for the purpose of offering goods for sale at wholesale or retail; public assembly; or viewing, entertainment, or education. "Public building" shall not include a working farm or farms, as that term is defined by section 2730 of this title. However, for purposes of this chapter, "public building" shall not include existing housing on a working farm provided to farm employees or a farm building that is open for public tours and for which no fee is charged for those tours.
      </li>
      <li id="t20p07c174s2900ol19">
       "Technically infeasible" means that an alteration of a building or a facility has little likelihood of being made accessible because compliance with accessibility standards would require removal or alteration of a load-bearing member that is an essential part of the existing structural frame, or because other existing physical or site constraints prohibit modification or addition of elements, spaces, or features that are in full and strict compliance with the minimum requirements for new construction and are necessary to provide accessibility.
      </li>
      <li id="t20p07c174s2900ol110">
       "Unit" means a self-contained portion of a public building under the control of the owner or lessee of the public building, such as a retail store in a shopping complex or a restaurant in an office building.

     <p>
      As used in this subchapter, the term "fireworks" means any combustible or explosive composition, or any substance or combination of substances, or article prepared for the purpose of producing a visible or an audible effect by combustion, explosion, deflagration, or detonation, including blank cartridges, toy pistols, toy cannons, toy canes, or toy guns in which explosives are used, balloons that are propelled by explosives, firecrackers, torpedoes, sky rockets, Roman candles, cherry bombs, or other fireworks of like construction and any fireworks containing any explosive or flammable compound, or any tablets or other device containing any explosive substance, except sparklers. The term "fireworks" does not include toy pistols, toy canes, toy guns, or other devices in which paper caps containing 0.25 grains or less of explosive compound are used, providing they are so constructed that the hand cannot come in contact with the cap when in place for use, and toy pistol paper caps that contain less than 0.2 grains of explosive mixture. The term "fireworks" does not include fixed ammunition for firearms or primers for firearms. The term "sparkler" means a sparkling item that complies with the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission regulations and is one of the following:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t20p07c177sub03s3131ol11">

       <p>
        The prosecution of defendant in 1994 for selling fireworks was not barred by claim preclusion, or res judicata, because, although the parties and causes of action may have been the same in 1987, 1992 and 1994, the subject matter was not. Defendant was charged with a crime that is capable of frequent repetition. Each event is separate and gives rise to separate liability. State v. Dann, 167 Vt. 119, 702 A.2d 105 (1997), cert. denied, Wurzberger v. Vermont, 522 U.S. 1112, 118 S. Ct. 1043, 140 L. Ed. 2d 108 (1998).

       <p>
        There is little difference between an intent to sell fireworks and a knowing sale of fireworks. Thus, there was no error in charging the jury that, in order to convict, it had to find that defendants acted "knowingly" and that their acts were "voluntary and conscious and not because of mistake, inadvertence, accident or some other innocent mistake," and in failing to charge, as requested, that defendants must have intended to commit the elements of the offense.

         4. Permits.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Because Vermont law did not authorize a permit for the general retail sale of fireworks to consumers who did not hold valid permits to display those fireworks, appellants, whose store sold fireworks for use by consumers, without regard to whether the purchasers had permits to possess and display them, were not entitled to a permit to sell fireworks. Green Mtn. Fireworks v. Town of Colchester, - Vt.
    - , 249 A.3d 296 (Aug. 7, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Based on the plain language of the fireworks permit statute, a distinct municipal permit is required for the sale of fireworks, and appellants' zoning permits were insufficient under the statute. Green Mtn. Fireworks v. Town of Colchester, - Vt.
    - , 249 A.3d 296 (Aug. 7, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute governing fireworks permits requires a distinct permit for the sale of fireworks, but does not authorize a permit for the general retail sale of fireworks to consumers who do not hold valid permits to display those fireworks. The only fireworks sales authorized by the statute are sales to the holder of a display permit for the purpose of the permitted display. Green Mtn. Fireworks v. Town of Colchester, - Vt.
    - , 249 A.3d 296 (Aug. 7, 2020).

       <p>
        Running at large is used in the section in the sense of strolling without restraint or confinement, as wandering, roving, or rambling at will, unrestrained. Russell v. Cone, 46 Vt. 600 (1874).
       </p>
       <p>
        As to the nature, character and amount of restraint necessary to be exercised over a domestic animal when permitted to be on a highway incident to its use, there is no general rule under the statute: The restraint need not be entirely physical; it may depend much upon the training, habits, and instincts of the animal in the particular case; and the sufficiency of the restraint is to be determined more from its effect upon, and controlling and restraining influence over, the animal, than from the nature or kind. Russell v. Cone, 46 Vt. 600 (1874).

        An instruction of the court to the jury that if a horse, after the defendant left it to go back home, was out of control of him and his son, and running about in the highway, at liberty to follow its own instincts and inclinations, and to go wherever it would, it was running at large within the meaning of the section, was, as a general proposition, correct.

        Where the defendant, or his son, kept so near a horse that, owing to its training, it would not wander about the highway when thus left, and would, and did, on such occasions go directly back to the defendant's premises, or to his son, it was not running at large within the meaning of this section.

        The phrase "knowingly permits" in this section is to be construed the same as the like phrase in
        §
        3341 of this title. State v. Clark, 118 Vt. 131, 101 A.2d 868 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        Merely permitting cattle to go at large implies knowledge, consent or willingness on the part of the owner or the custodian, or such negligent conduct as is equivalent thereto. State v. Clark, 118 Vt. 131, 101 A.2d 868 (1954).

       </h5>
       <p>
        As used in this section, the word "knowingly" imports a knowledge of the essential facts from which the law presumes a knowledge of the legal consequences arising therefrom; therefore, for example, if one pastures his cattle unattended in an unfenced field, which abuts upon a highway and adjoins land of another located upon the same highway, and the cattle go therefrom into and along the highway and go upon such adjoining land, he has knowingly neglected to restrain them, because of the well known tendency of cattle in such circumstances to stray, and the same rule also applies when the cattle escape through a defective fence between the field and highway, when the owner knows that the cattle will be likely to escape through such fence. State v. Clark, 118 Vt. 131, 101 A.2d 868 (1954).

       </h5>
       <p>
        In a prosecution under this section the state must prove facts which will justify a jury in finding beyond a reasonable doubt that cattle went on the land of another, either by voluntary act of the owner or custodian, or by reason of his having knowingly neglected to restrain them. State v. Clark, 118 Vt. 131, 101 A.2d 868 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, in a prosecution under this section, the evidence relied on to show that the owner knowingly neglected to restrain his cattle from going on the land of another is entirely circumstantial, the circumstances proved must exclude every reasonable hypothesis except that the owner is guilty. State v. Clark, 118 Vt. 131, 101 A.2d 868 (1954).

       <p>
        When two or more rams owned by different persons escaped together and were found with the sheep of another, the owner of each was liable to the penalty for the escape of his own ram, and payment by one of the penalty that he was subject to for escape of his ram was no discharge of the liability of the other. Town v. Lamphire, 37 Vt. 52 (1864).
       </p>
       <p>
        The owner or keeper of a ram was bound to restrain him at all events during the season prescribed in subsection (a) of this section and could not rely for defense in an action under subsection (b) of the section on the promise of an adjoining owner to keep up a legal fence. Town v. Lamphire, 37 Vt. 52 (1864).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (b) of this section is violated if a ram is found off its owner's or keeper's premises and with the sheep of another, unless this was caused by some positive wrongful act of the prosecutor of the action himself, or could not have been prevented by the utmost care and diligence of the owner or keeper. Town v. Lamphire, 36 Vt. 101 (1863).
       </p>
       <p>
        The neglect of the prosecutor of an action under subsection (b) of this section to maintain and keep in repair his portion of a division fence through which a ram escaped was not a positive wrongful act as would excuse the owner or keeper of the ram from liability.

        Consistent with Vermont statutory law, because a noncustodial landowner had no connection to the ownership, management, or control of an injurious horse owned by a tenant or the fence that contained the horse, the landowner had no duty to prevent the horse from escaping and harming passing motorists.

       <p>
        In an action of tort brought under this section for the death of plaintiff's decedent from injuries inflicted by a stallion running at large, whether the defendant, who had not willfully permitted the animal to go at large, had otherwise taken adequate precautions to prevent the escape of the animal, and whether the defendant's negligence, if any, caused the decedent's injury, were properly questions for the jury.

      1. Purpose of statute
     </b>
     .
    </h5>
    <p>
     The object of the statute is to compel the owners of animals to restrain their animals from running at large to the annoyance and damage of others, and to give to any one who is thus injured and annoyed, a summary remedy, not only to relieve and protect himself from such encroachment, but to compensate himself for damage he has suffered; to that end, he is authorized to seize the animals, if taken in the act, and impound or imprison them, until his damages and charges are paid, and even to sell them at public auction if the owner of the animals fails to make payment. Harriman v. Fifield, 36 Vt. 341 (1863).
    </p>
    <h5 id="t20p08c191sub02a01a02-annotations-2">
     <b>
      2. Nature of proceedings.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     The action of both parties is required to be most prompt and speedy: notice of the impounding must be given to the owner of the animals within twenty-four hours, and if the impounder claims for damages the animals have done, he must give notice for the appointment of appraisers of the damage at the same time, and all subsequent action on both sides is equally summary. Harriman v. Fifiels, 36 Vt. 341 (1863).
    </p>
    <p>
     The whole proceeding rests upon the idea that the impounded animals are to be confined in close legal custody, from which they are to be relieved at the earliest moment, after reparation can be made for the damage they have done, and the costs of the proceeding and charges for keeping. Harriman v. Fifiels, 36 Vt. 341 (1863).

       </h5>
       <p>
        A person may impound animals found in his "enclosure" doing damage and the word "enclosure," as used in the section, means only that the land is occupied, not that it is fenced. Davis v. Mudgett, 81 Vt. 252, 69 A. 762 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right to impound applied to an animal found by a person in his "enclosure" doing damage; only occupied land is deemed an enclosure. Porter v. Aldrich, 39 Vt. 326 (1866).
       </p>
       <p>
        The legislature did not intend for the summary remedy by impoundment of animals for damages feasant to extend to animals upon wild, uncultivated, unimproved and unoccupied land lying open and common. Porter v. Aldrich, 39 Vt. 326 (1866).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to impound it is not necessary for a landowner to have enclosed a field with a legal fence. Keith v. Bradford, 39 Vt. 34 (1866).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a landowner has done upon and around his own land, by way of fence and improvement and occupancy, all that the law requires in order, under the same law, to cast the duty on others to keep their cattle off his land, such land, in the sense of the word as used in this section, giving the right to impound, is the enclosure of the owner. Keith v. Bradford, 39 Vt. 34 (1866).

        There may be a restraining of animals taken doing damage without its being an impounding; to constitute an impounding; the animals must be placed in a pound and there restrained with the intent on the part of the person so restraining them to impound them.

        It was duty of a poundkeeper to advertise, whether the impounding was lawful or unlawful. Farrar v. Bell, 73 Vt. 342, 50 A. 1107 (1901).

        The duty to advertise cattle impounded was ministerial and could be delegated to a servant, and though the poundkeeper was personally absent and unaware of the impounding, it must be performed within the time fixed by the section, or their detention thereafter became unlawful.

        This section, and other statutes concerning dog damage to domestic animals and fowl, did not undertake to cover the whole subject matter of dog damage, and, insofar as they were more narrow than the common law, the common law right continued as to cases outside their scope. State v. Sylvester, 112 Vt. 202, 22 A.2d 505 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the common law, to warrant the killing of a dog for the protection of domestic animal or fowl, the circumstances must have been such as to create a reasonable belief that such killing was necessary to prevent injury to the animal or fowl.

       When a domestic pet or wolf-hybrid has bitten a person while the domestic pet or wolf-hybrid is off the premises of the owner or keeper, and the person bitten requires medical attention for the attack, the person may file a written complaint with the legislative body of the municipality. The complaint shall contain the time, date, and place where the attack occurred, the name and address of the victim or victims, and any other facts that may assist the legislative body in conducting its investigation required by subsection (b) of this section.

       The legislative body, within seven days from receipt of the complaint, shall investigate the charges and hold a hearing on the matter.

The order shall be sent by certified mail, return receipt requested. A person who, after receiving notice, fails to comply with the terms of the order shall be subject to the penalties provided in section 3550 of this chapter.

       The procedures provided in this section shall apply if the domestic pet or wolf-hybrid is not a rabies suspect.

        The penalty provided in this section applies to violations of
        §
        3681 of this title, where the keeper of a kennel fails to obtain the required permit. 1950-52 Op. Atty. Gen. 253.
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a dog was found at large without the prescribed collar, which he had just lost without the knowledge or the fault of owner, the owner was not liable to the penalty imposed by this section on "a person keeping a dog contrary to the foregoing provisions" for the word "keeping" is synonymous with maintaining, and implies some degree of permanence.

       <p>
        In a prosecution under this section for keeping a dog without a license, where the defendant answered that the dog was vicious and could not be licensed, a verdict of guilty was properly entered; it being unlawful to keep a dog without a license, and also unlawful to procure a license for a vicious dog, it follows that a vicious dog cannot be kept at all.

     <p>
      A pet dealer shall apply to the municipal clerk of the town or city in which the cats, dogs, or wolf-hybrids are kept for a pet dealer permit to be issued on forms prescribed by the Secretary and pay the clerk a fee of $25.00 for the permit. A pet dealer who acquires a pet dealer permit shall allow inspections of the pet dealer's premises pursuant to section 3682 of this title as a condition of receiving and retaining the permit. The provisions of subchapters 1, 2, and 4 of this chapter not inconsistent with this subchapter shall apply to the pet dealer permit, which shall be in addition to other permits required. A pet dealer permit shall expire on March 31 next after issuance and shall be displayed prominently on the premises in which the cats, dogs, or wolf-hybrids are kept. If the permit fee is not paid by April 1, the owner or keeper may thereafter procure a permit for that license year by paying a fee of 50 percent in excess of that otherwise required. Municipal clerks shall maintain a record of the type of animals being kept by the permit holder. Upon issuance of the pet dealer permit, the municipal clerk shall provide the pet dealer with a copy of Part 3 (Standards) of the Animal Welfare Rules adopted by the Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets relating to cats, dogs, and wolf-hybrids. The municipal clerk shall also provide the pet dealer with contact information for the Animal Health Section within the Division of Food Safety and Consumer Protection of the Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets and with information from the Department of Taxes on sales tax obligations for the sale of pets.

       The pet dealer's premises may be inspected upon the issuance of the pet dealer permit or at any time the pet dealer permit is in effect. Inspections may be conducted by a municipal animal control officer, a law enforcement officer as that term is defined in <cite class="vt-code">23 V.S.A. § 4(11)</cite>, or a representative of the Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets. The inspector may, at his or her discretion and with the approval of the municipality, be accompanied by a veterinarian or an officer or agent of a humane society incorporated in Vermont. This section shall not create an obligation on the part of any municipal legislative body to conduct inspections.
      </li>
      <li id="t20p08c193sub03s3682ol1b">
       Inspections shall be scheduled in advance with the pet dealer or pet dealer's agent. Inspections shall be conducted to facilitate compliance with the applicable standards in Part 3 (Standards) of the Animal Welfare Rules adopted by the Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets relating to cats, dogs, and wolf-hybrids. The person or persons authorized to inspect the pet dealer's premises shall be accompanied by the pet dealer or pet dealer's agent. If the pet dealer's premises are also used for human habitation, the inspection may occur only in those areas of the premises used for animal housing, animal care, birthing, and storage of food and bedding. Photographs or videos of the pet dealer's premises or property shall not be taken during an inspection and while on the pet dealer's premises without the written consent of the permit holder. Repeated failure to consent to an inspection may result in a revocation of the pet dealer permit.
      </li>
      <li id="t20p08c193sub03s3682ol1c">
       If an inspector, during the course of an inspection under this section, has reason to believe that a criminal animal welfare violation exists on the pet dealer's premises, nothing in this chapter shall preclude a criminal investigation into the suspected violation or shall preclude seeking the remedies available under 13 V.S.A. chapter 8. Assessment of an administrative penalty under this chapter shall not prevent assessment of a criminal penalty under 13 V.S.A. chapter 8.
      </li>
      <li id="t20p08c193sub03s3682ol1d">
       The inspector shall record the results of each inspection in a log and sign and date each entry. The entries shall be submitted to the municipality, which shall maintain records of all pet dealer inspections. A copy of the inspection results shall be provided to the permit holder.

        Where, in an action against a town for the value of sheep killed by dogs, the defendant's evidence showed that its selectman, when notified by the plaintiff, failed to perform his duty to determine whether the sheep had been killed by dogs, the defendant was not prejudiced by an instruction that, if the selectman when notified did not make a full, fair, and honest investigation, he did not do his duty, and plaintiff could recover if his case was made out in other respects.

        If the department of agriculture finds that the mandatory vaccination of dogs and the limited use of fox den bombings are not adequate to stop the spread of rabies, it may hold a hearing in the affected area relative to the use of poisonous bait. 1964-66 Op. Atty. Gen. 57.

        Since this section does not indicate the procedure for publicizing a public hearing, reasonable publication, such as two weeks' publication in a newspaper circulated in the affected area, should precede the hearing. 1964-66 Op. Atty. Gen. 57.

However, if the official finds that it is not reasonable to suspect that a domestic pet or wolf-hybrid impounded under section 3806 of this title is rabid or has been exposed to rabies, the official may deliver the domestic pet or wolf-hybrid to the owner. When it is impractical to confine or impound a domestic pet or wolf-hybrid pursuant to section 3806 of this title, or when the owner of a domestic pet or wolf-hybrid confined or impounded cannot be ascertained, the officials may immediately order the domestic pet or wolf-hybrid to be killed.

     Legislative findings and intent.

    <cite class="vt-code">2017, No. 5</cite>,
    
     §
    
    1 provides: "The General Assembly finds that:
     </p>
     <p>
      "(1) In Vermont, we celebrate the rich cultural heritage and diversity of our residents.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(2) All Vermont residents should be free from discrimination on the basis of their sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, race, color, religion, national origin, immigration status, age, or disability.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(3) Vermont must uphold the protection of religious freedom enshrined in the U.S. Constitution and the Vermont Constitution for all its people, and the State has a moral obligation to protect its residents from religious persecution.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(4) Article 3 of Chapter I of the Vermont Constitution prohibits any power from assuming any authority that interferes with or controls, in any manner, the rights of conscience in the free exercise of religious worship.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(5) Article 7 of Chapter I of the Vermont Constitution, also known as the Common Benefits Clause, provides that State benefits and protections are "for the common benefit, protection, and security of the people, nation, or community, and not for the particular emolument or advantage of any single person, family, or set of persons, who are a part only of that community."
     </p>
     <p>
      "(6) Vermont residents have a right to privacy with respect to religious affiliation and an expectation that religious affiliation or identification shall not affect their residency in the State.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(7) Vermont residents are afforded the benefits and protections of law enforcement and public safety without regard to their sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, marital status, race, color, religion, national origin, immigration status, age, or disability. Consequently, they have a reasonable expectation that government officials will not monitor them or otherwise single them out merely on the basis of these characteristics. They likewise have a reasonable expectation that State and local government officials will not contribute to the creation or development of a registry based on the personally identifying information as defined in this act. Indeed, Vermont residents have expressed grave concerns that the federal government seeks to create or develop such a registry, which would be contrary to Vermont and American values. This act is intended to narrowly address those concerns without impeding Vermont residents' enjoyment of other legal rights and benefits.
     </p>
     <p>
      "(8) Vermont State and local law enforcement work tirelessly to protect the rights and security of all Vermont residents afforded them under the Vermont and U.S. Constitutions. Moreover, Vermont residents benefit from and are safer through the cooperative and mutually beneficial interaction between local, State, and federal law enforcement, including the U.S. Border Patrol.

      "(9) Vermont residents are more likely to engage with law enforcement and other officials by reporting emergencies, crimes, and acting as witnesses; to participate in economic activity; and to be engaged in civic life if they can be assured they will not be singled out on the basis of the personally identifying information as defined in this act.

      "(10) This act is not intended to interfere with the enforcement of Vermont's public safety laws or efforts to prioritize immigration enforcement concerning individuals who pose a threat to Vermont's public safety.

      "(11) The State of Vermont therefore has a substantial, sovereign interest in prohibiting State and local government officials from collecting or disclosing certain information to federal authorities for the purposes of registration of its residents based on the personally identifying information as defined in this act. These prohibitions are not intended to interfere with Vermont residents' rights to free and equal access to government benefits and protection or the collection or sharing of data necessary to provide such benefits and protections."
