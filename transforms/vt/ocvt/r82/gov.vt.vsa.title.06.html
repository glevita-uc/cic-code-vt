      It is hereby declared that the inability of individual producers to develop new and larger markets for agricultural commodities results in an unreasonable and unnecessary economic waste of the agricultural wealth of this State. These conditions and the accompanying waste jeopardize the future continued production of adequate food supplies for the people of this and other states. These conditions vitally concern the health, safety, and general welfare of the people in this State. It is therefore declared the legislative purpose and the policy of this State:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t06p02c24sub01s250ol11">
       to enable agricultural producers of this State, with the aid of the State, to more effectively correlate the marketing of their agricultural commodities with market demands;

      It shall be unlawful to use the term "maple syrup" or "maple sugar," however modified, to describe any product, flavoring, sweetener, or food additive unless the product, flavoring, sweetener, or food additive so described meets the statutory definition of "maple syrup" or "maple sugar." Terms such as "artificial maple syrup" or "artificial maple sugar" are declared to be misleading and deceptive and may not be used in the labeling or advertising of any product. Terms such as "artificial maple flavor" or "artificial maple flavor sweetener" may be used to describe a product flavored or sweetened with a substance which attempts to duplicate real maple flavor, providing that words such as "artificial," "flavor," and other modifiers of the word "maple" shall appear in equal prominence to the word "maple" on the label and in all advertising of the product.

       In order to avoid confusion, endangering the public health, resulting from diverse requirements, particularly as to the labeling and coloring of economic poisons, and to avoid increased costs to the people of this State due to the necessity of complying with such diverse requirements in the manufacture and sale of such poisons, it is desirable that there should be uniformity between the requirements of the several states and the federal government relating to such poisons.
    To this end the Secretary is authorized to adopt rules, applicable to and in conformity with the primary standards established by this chapter, as have been or may be prescribed by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency with respect to economic poisons.

      <p>
       The examination of economic poisons shall be made under the direction of the Secretary for the purpose of determining whether they comply with the requirements of this chapter.
    If it shall appear from such examination that an economic poison fails to comply with the provisions of this chapter, and the Secretary contemplates instituting criminal proceedings against any person, the Secretary shall cause appropriate notice to be given to such person.
    Any person so notified shall be given an opportunity to present his or her views, either orally or in writing, with regard to such contemplated proceedings and if thereafter in the opinion of the Secretary it shall appear that the provisions of the chapter have been violated by such person, then the Secretary shall refer the facts to the State's Attorney for the county in which the violation shall have occurred with a copy of the results of the analysis or the examination of such article.
    However, nothing in this chapter shall be construed as requiring the Secretary to report for prosecution or for the institution of libel proceedings minor violations of the chapter whenever he or she believes that the public interests will be best served by a suitable notice of warning in writing.

      Assistance and Reimbursement
     </p>
     <p>
      (a)
    Each party state pledges to each other party state that it will employ its best efforts to eradicate, or control within the strictest practicable limits, any and all pests. It is recognized that performance of this responsibility involves:
     </p>
     <p>
      (1) The maintenance of pest control and eradication activities of interstate significance by a party state at a level that would be reasonable for its own protection in the absence of this compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      (2) The meeting of emergency outbreaks or infestations of interstate significance to no less an extent than would have been done in the absence of this compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      (b)
    Whenever a party state is threatened by a pest not present within its borders but present within another party state, or whenever a party state is undertaking or engaged in activities for the control or eradication of a pest or pests, and finds that such activities are or would be impracticable or substantially more difficult of success by reason of failure of another party state to cope with infestation or threatened infestation, that state may request the Governing Board to authorize expenditures from the Insurance Fund for eradication or control measures to be taken by one or more of such other party states at a level sufficient to prevent, or to reduce to the greatest practicable extent, infestation or reinfestation of the requesting state. Upon such authorization, the responding state or states shall take or increase such eradication or control measures as may be warranted. A responding state shall use moneys available from the Insurance Fund expeditiously and efficiently to assist in affording the protection requested.
     </p>
     <p>
      (c)
    In order to apply for expenditures from the Insurance Fund, a requesting state shall submit the following in writing:
     </p>
     <p>
      (1) A detailed statement of the circumstances which occasion the request for the invoking of the compact.
     </p>

      (2) Evidence that the pest on account of whose eradication or control assistance is requested constitutes a danger to an agricultural or forest crop, product, tree, shrub, grass, or other plant having a substantial value to the requesting state.
     </p>
     <p>
      (d)
    The Governing Board or Executive Committee shall give due notice of any meeting at which an application for assistance from the Insurance Fund is to be considered. Such notice shall be given to the compact administrator of each party state and to such other officers and agencies as may be designated by the laws of the party states. The requesting state and any other party state shall be entitled to be represented and present evidence and argument at such meeting.
     </p>
     <p>
      (e)
    Upon the submission as required by subsection (c) of this article and such other information as it may have or acquire, and upon determining that an expenditure of funds is within the purposes of this compact and justified thereby, the Governing Board or Executive Committee shall authorize support of the program. The Governing Board or Executive Committee may meet at any time or place for the purpose of receiving and considering an application. Any and all determinations of the Governing Board or Executive Committee, with respect to an application, together with the reasons therefor shall be recorded and subscribed in such manner as to show and preserve the votes of the individual members thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      (f)
    A requesting state which is dissatisfied with a determination of the Executive Committee shall upon notice in writing given within 20 days of the determination with which it is dissatisfied, be entitled to receive a review thereof at the next meeting of the Governing Board. Determinations of the Executive Committee shall be reviewable only by the Governing Board at one of its regular meetings, or at a special meeting held in such manner as the Governing Board may authorize.
     </p>
     <p>
      (g)
    Responding states required to undertake or increase measures pursuant to this compact may receive moneys from the Insurance Fund, either at the time or times when such state incurs expenditures on account of such measures, or as reimbursement for expenses incurred and chargeable to the Insurance Fund. The Governing Board shall adopt and, from time to time, may amend or revise procedures for submission of claims upon it and for payment thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      (h)
    Before authorizing the expenditure of moneys from the Insurance Fund pursuant to an application of a requesting state, the Insurance Fund shall ascertain the extent and nature of any timely assistance or participation which may be available from the federal government and shall request the appropriate agency or agencies of the federal government for such assistance and participation.

Any such Advisory or Technical Committee or any member or members thereof may meet with and participate in its deliberations upon request of the Governing Board or Executive Committee. An Advisory or Technical Committee may furnish information and recommendations with respect to any application for assistance from the Insurance Fund being considered by such Board or Committee, and the Board or Committee may receive and consider the same, provided that any participant in a meeting of the Governing Board or Executive Committee held pursuant to Article VI(d) of the compact shall be entitled to know the substance of any such information and recommendations, at the time of the meeting if made prior thereto or as a part thereof or, if made thereafter, no later than the time at which the Governing Board or Executive Committee makes its disposition of the application.

    A party state may make application for assistance from the Insurance Fund in respect of a pest in a nonparty state. Such application shall be considered and disposed of by the Governing Board or Executive Committee in the same manner as an application with respect to a pest within a party state, except as provided in this article.
     </p>
     <p>
      (b)
    At or in connection with any meeting of the Governing Board or Executive Committee held pursuant to Article VI(d) of this compact, a nonparty state shall be entitled to appear, participate, and receive information only to such extent as the Governing Board or Executive Committee may provide. A nonparty state shall not be entitled to review of any determination made by the Executive Committee.
     </p>
     <p>
      (c)
    The Governing Board or Executive Committee shall authorize expenditures from the Insurance Fund to be made in a nonparty state only after determining that the conditions in such state and the value of such expenditures to the party states as a whole justify them. The Governing Board or Executive Committee may set any conditions which it deems appropriate with respect to the expenditure of moneys from the Insurance Fund in a nonparty state and may enter into such agreement or agreements with nonparty states and other jurisdictions or entities as it may deem necessary or appropriate to protect the interests of the Insurance Fund with respect to expenditures and activities outside party states.

      (a)
    The Insurance Fund shall submit to the executive head or designated officer or officers of each party state a budget for the Insurance Fund for such period as may be required by the laws of that party state for a presentation to the legislature thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      (b)
    Each of the budgets shall contain specific recommendations of the amount or amounts to be appropriated by each of the party states. The request for appropriations shall be apportioned among the party states as follows: one-tenth of the total budget in equal shares and the remainder in proportion to the value of agricultural and forest crops and products, excluding animals and animal products, produced in each party state. In determining the value of such crops and products, the Insurance Fund may employ such source or sources of information as in its judgment present the most equitable and accurate comparisons among the party states. Each of the budgets and requests for appropriations shall indicate the source or sources used in obtaining information concerning value of products.
     </p>
     <p>
      (c)
    The financial assets of the Insurance Fund shall be maintained in two accounts to be designated respectively as the "operating account" and the "claims account." The operating account shall consist only of those assets necessary for the administration of the Insurance Fund during the next ensuing two-year period. The claims account shall contain all moneys not included in the operating account and shall not exceed the amount reasonably estimated to be sufficient to pay all legitimate claims on the Insurance Fund for a period of three years. At any time when the claims account has reached its maximum limit or would reach its maximum limit by the addition of moneys requested for appropriation by the party states, the Governing Board shall reduce its budget requests on a pro rata basis in such manner as to keep the claims account within such maximum limit. Any moneys in the claims account by virtue of conditional donations, grants, or gifts shall be included in calculations made pursuant to this subsection only to the extent that such moneys are available to meet demands arising out of the claims.
     </p>
     <p>
      (d)
    The Insurance Fund shall not pledge the credit of any party state. The Insurance Fund may meet any of its obligations in whole or in part with moneys available to it under Article IV(g) of this compact, provided that the Governing Board take specific action setting aside such moneys prior to incurring any obligation to be met in whole or in part in such manner. Except where the Insurance Fund makes use of moneys available to it under Article IV(g) hereof, the Insurance Fund shall not incur any obligation prior to the allotment of moneys by the party states adequate to meet the same.
     </p>
     <p>
      (e)
    The Insurance Fund shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the Insurance Fund shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Insurance Fund shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant and a report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the Insurance Fund.
     </p>
     <p>
      (f)
    The accounts of the Insurance Fund shall be open at any reasonable time for inspection by duly authorized officers of the party states and by any persons authorized by the Insurance Fund.

      (b)
    Any party state may withdraw from this compact by enacting a statute repealing the same, but no such withdrawal shall take effect until two years after the executive head of the withdrawing state has given notice in writing of the withdrawal to the executive heads of all other party states. No withdrawal shall affect any liability already incurred by or chargeable to a party state prior to the time of such withdrawal.

The provisions of this compact shall be severable and if any phrase, clause, sentence, or provision of this compact is declared to be contrary to the constitution of any state or of the United States or the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance is held invalid, the validity of the remainder of this compact and the applicability thereof to any government, agency, person, or circumstance shall not be affected thereby. If this compact shall be held contrary to the constitution of any state participating herein, the compact shall remain in full force and effect as to the remaining party states and in full force and effect as to the state affected as to all severable matters.

      Within a reasonable time, the Secretary shall examine any imported domestic animal placed in quarantine and may apply such tests or retests as the Secretary deems necessary to determine the health of the animals. After tests or retests ordered by the Secretary have been applied, any domestic animal found free from contagious or infectious disease shall be released from quarantine, unless the Secretary determines that the animal may have been exposed to a contagious disease and that it is necessary to continue the quarantine in order to prevent the potential spread of a contagious disease.

      <ol type="a">
       <li id="t06p06c141sub01a01s1801ol1a">
        The purpose of this compact is to recognize by constitutional prerequisite the interstate character of the northeast dairy industry and to form an Interstate Commission for the northeast region. The mission of the Commission is to take such steps as are necessary to assure the continued viability of dairy farming in the northeast, and to assure consumers of an adequate, local supply of pure and wholesome milk.
       </li>
       <li id="t06p06c141sub01a01s1801ol1b">
        The participating states find and declare that the dairy industry is the paramount agricultural activity of the northeast. Dairy farms, and associated suppliers, marketers, processors, and retailers, are an integral component of the region's economy. Their ability to provide a stable, local supply of pure, wholesome milk is a matter of great importance to the health and welfare of the region.
       </li>
       <li id="t06p06c141sub01a01s1801ol1c">
        The participating states further find that dairy farms are essential to the region's rural communities and character. The farms preserve open spaces, sculpt the landscape, and provide the land base for a diversity of recreational pursuits. In defining the rural character of our communities and landscape, dairy farms also provide a major draw for our tourist industries.
       </li>
       <li id="t06p06c141sub01a01s1801ol1d">
        By entering into this compact, the participating states affirm that their ability to regulate the price which northeast dairy farmers receive for their product is essential to the public interest.
       </li>
       <li id="t06p06c141sub01a01s1801ol1e">
        Assurance of a fair and equitable price for dairy farmers ensures their ability to provide milk to the market and the vitality of the northeast dairy industry, with all the associated benefits.
       </li>
       <li id="t06p06c141sub01a01s1801ol1f">
        Recent, dramatic price fluctuations, with a pronounced downward trend, threaten the viability and stability of the northeast dairy region. Historically, individual state regulatory action has been an effective emergency remedy available to farmers confronting a distressed market. The federal order system, implemented by the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, establishes only minimum prices for dairy products, without preempting the power of states to regulate milk prices above the minimum levels so established. Based on this authority, each state in the region has individually attempted to implement at least one regulatory program in response to the current dairy industry crisis.
       </li>
       <li id="t06p06c141sub01a01s1801ol1g">
        In today's regional dairy marketplace, cooperative rather than individual state action may address more effectively the market disarray. Under our constitutional system, properly authorized, states acting cooperatively may exercise more power to regulate interstate commerce than they may assert individually without such authority. For this reason, the participating states invoke their authority to act in common agreement, with the consent of Congress, under the compact clause of the Constitution.
       </li>
       <li id="t06p06c141sub01a01s1801ol1h">
        In establishing their constitutional regulatory authority over the region's fluid milk market by this compact, the participating states declare their purpose that this compact neither displace the federal order system nor encourage the merging of federal orders. Specific provisions of the compact itself set forth this basic principle.
       </li>
       <li id="t06p06c141sub01a01s1801ol1i">
        Designed as a flexible mechanism able to adjust to changes in a regulated marketplace, the compact also contains a contingency provision should the federal order system be discontinued. In that event, the Interstate Commission is authorized to regulate the marketplace in replacement of the order system. This contingent authority does not anticipate such a change, however, and should not be so construed. It is only provided should developments in the market other than establishment of this compact result in discontinuance of the order system.

       This compact shall be construed liberally in order to achieve the purposes and intent enunciated in section 1801 of this compact. It is the intent of this compact to establish a basic structure by which the Commission may achieve those purposes through the application, adaptation, and development of the regulatory techniques historically associated with milk marketing and to afford the Commission broad flexibility to devise regulatory mechanisms to achieve the purposes of this compact. In accordance with this intent, the technical terms which are associated with market order regulation and which have acquired commonly understood general meanings are not defined herein but the Commission may further define the terms used in this compact and develop additional concepts and define additional terms as it may find appropriate to achieve its purposes.

     <p>
      Before promulgation of any regulations establishing a compact over-order price or Commission marketing order, including any provision with respect to milk supply under subsection 1809(f), or amendment thereof, as provided in Article IV, the Commission shall conduct an informal rulemaking proceeding to provide interested persons with an opportunity to present data and views. Such rulemaking proceeding shall be governed by section four of the federal Administrative Procedure Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. § 553).
    In addition, the Commission shall, to the extent practicable, publish notice of rulemaking proceedings in the official register of each participating state. Before the initial adoption of regulations establishing a compact over-order price or a Commission marketing order and thereafter before any amendment with regard to prices or assessments, the Commission shall hold a public hearing. The Commission may commence a rulemaking proceeding on its own initiative or may, in its sole discretion, act upon the petition of any person including individual milk producers, any organization of milk producers or handlers, general farm organizations, consumer or public interest groups, and local, state, or federal officials.

       It is the policy of the State of Vermont to protect and promote the public interest by:
       <ol>
        <li id="t06p06c151sub01s2671ol1a1">
         Insuring the citizens of this State and the general public an adequate supply of pure fresh milk and other dairy products of constantly improving quality.
        </li>
        <li id="t06p06c151sub01s2671ol1a2">
         Establishing such appropriate dairy laws, regulations, and administrative procedures, as will protect the public health and welfare.
        </li>
        <li id="t06p06c151sub01s2671ol1a3">
         Improving the economy of the State and the welfare of dairy farmers and milk handlers by improving the competitive position of the dairy industry and increasing the consumption of milk and other dairy products.
        </li>
        <li id="t06p06c151sub01s2671ol1a4">
         Securing uniformity in dairy standards, labeling, and sanitary procedures, and developing milk markets by cooperating and coordinating with the appropriate dairy agencies of other states and the federal government to the extent consistent with the interest of the State of Vermont.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t06p06c151sub01s2671ol1b">
       It is essential, in order to assure the continued production of milk and its handling and distribution, that prices to producers be such as to return reasonable cost of production and at the same time assure an adequate supply of milk and dairy products to consumers at reasonable prices; and to these ends it is essential that consumers and others be adequately informed as to the dietary needs and advantages of milk and dairy products and as to the economics resulting from the use of milk and dairy products, and to command for milk and dairy products consumer attention and demand consistent with their importance and value.
    It is further declared that continued decline in the consumption of fluid milk and some other dairy products will jeopardize the production of adequate supplies of milk and dairy products because of increasing surpluses necessarily returning less to producers; and that continued adequate supplies of milk and dairy products is a matter of vital concern as affecting the health and general welfare of the people of this State.
    It is therefore declared to be the legislative intent and policy of the State:
       <ol>
        <li id="t06p06c151sub01s2671ol1b1">
         to enable milk producers and others in the dairy industry, with the aid of the State, to more effectively promote the consumption of milk and dairy products;
        </li>
        <li id="t06p06c151sub01s2671ol1b2">
         to provide methods and means for the development of new and improved dairy products, and to promote their use; and
        </li>
        <li id="t06p06c151sub01s2671ol1b3">
         to this end, to eliminate the possible impairment of the purchasing power of the milk producers of this State and to assure an adequate supply of milk for consumers at reasonable prices.

       Role of state government.
    
    The Vermont General Assembly finds, as does the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, that the states under our federal system of government have traditionally undertaken the role of overseeing milk production. The Vermont General Assembly also finds that the intent of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is to rely primarily on state governments to validate rbST labeling claims regarding milk and dairy products and to ensure that such claims are truthful and not misleading.

    It is the policy of this State:
       <ol>
        <li id="t06p06c151sub05s2760ol1b1">
         that Vermont citizens should have an opportunity to choose to consume milk or dairy products which have not had rbST used in their production ("rbST-free"), based on truthful and nonmisleading product labeling;
        </li>
        <li id="t06p06c151sub05s2760ol1b2">
         that Vermont dairy product manufacturers who want to sell rbST-free products in Vermont or out of state should be able to do so, based on a State-sanctioned process for certifying rbST-free labeling claims;
        </li>
        <li id="t06p06c151sub05s2760ol1b3">
         that the economic health and vitality of the Vermont dairy industry is critical to the health of the overall Vermont economy, which depends in part on the high reputation of Vermont farmers and their dairy products, and the associated goodwill toward other Vermont enterprises, and that this economic asset should not be jeopardized by consumer doubts about the integrity of Vermont milk or dairy products caused by false, misleading, or unverifiable rbST-free labeling claims; and

         finds a substantial State interest in ensuring the availability of milk and dairy product labeling information that is accurate and nonmisleading, and in which Vermont and out-of-state consumers can place their confidence; and

        <li id="t06p06c151sub05s2760ol1c2">
         seeks to serve this interest through this subchapter by:

     §
    
    1 provides: "(a) Vermont farmers who currently sell unpasteurized (raw) milk directly to consumers operate in a largely unregulated environment that fails to address a full range of food safety issues, and in which restricted supply is the primary method of addressing food safety concerns.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(b) There are widely divergent views on unpasteurized milk's benefits and risks.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(c) Vermont's current unpasteurized milk law also limits economic development opportunities. Farmers sell their unpasteurized milk for $5.00 to $10.00 per gallon, which represents an economic opportunity.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(d) The purpose of this act is to allow farmers to sell larger quantities of unpasteurized milk while at the same time creating new sanitary production, marketing, and consumer education standards."

    If a handler fails so to disclose a producer's lien, he or she shall be liable to any person thereby injured in an action on this statute for the damages sustained.

    1 provides: "(a) Sec. 4 of No. 50 of the Acts of 2007 directed that the 'Vermont milk commission shall establish by rule ... a minimum producer price that is designed to achieve a price by which the cost of picking up the milk and hauling the milk from the farm to the purchaser will be paid by the purchaser.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(b) Under Sec. 6(c) of Act 50 (2007), the milk commission was directed to 'commence the rulemaking process necessary to implement the provisions of Sec. 4 ... within 60 days of the effective date of the act,' which became effective on May 26, 2007. Also under Sec. 6(c), the rule itself 'shall take effect when, by rule, legislation, or other agreement, New York and one other state in the Northeast Marketing Area, Federal Order 1, have accomplished the purpose of this act or on January 15, 2009, whichever comes first.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(c) Sec. 4 of Act 50 (2007) was amended the following year by Sec. 1 of No. 157 of the Acts of the 2007 Adj. Sess. (2008), which split Sec. 4 into two subsections. Subsection (a) directed the Vermont Milk Commission to establish 'by order ... a minimum producer price that is designed to reflect the cost of production,' Subsection (b) mandated that 'The cost of picking up the milk and hauling the milk from the farm to the purchaser will be paid by the purchaser.' Sec. 6(c) of Act 50 (2007) was also amended to change the date certain for the effective date of the milk commission's order from January 15, 2009 to July 1, 2010.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(d) Despite the mandate to the Vermont milk commission to adopt an order governing the minimum producer price and stop and hauling charges, no order was ever adopted. Furthermore, legal opinions differ as to the force and effect of the amendments made by Act 157 (2007 Adj. Sess.), and consequently, it remains uncertain whether and when the buyer of cows' milk, rather than the dairy producer, is responsible for paying dairy hauling costs.
    </p>
    <p>

       It is hereby declared by the General Assembly that dairy farming is of paramount importance in helping to maintain a strong economy and in preserving the State's remaining rural character; that dairy farming at present is in serious jeopardy because of the rapidly declining price of milk being paid to producers while corresponding costs of production remain the same or increase; that the federal milk marketing order minimum price for milk is now and may be in the future inadequate to cover the costs of milk production and provide for a reasonable economic return to dairy producers; that the entire distribution structure of the milk industry is threatened; and that Vermont should ensure that there is an adequate supply of milk for the consuming public both inside and outside Vermont.
    The General Assembly also reaffirms and restates its findings and statement of policy as set forth in section 2671 of this title.
    Due to the uncertainty in the federal market order structure and marked fluctuations in market order prices, the dairy industry of the State is imperiled, which is a menace to the health, welfare, and reasonable comfort of the inhabitants of the State.

       The general purposes of this subchapter are to protect and promote the public welfare by insuring at all times an adequate supply of clean, pure milk and cream of proper quality to meet the needs of the inhabitants of this State and to ensure the continuing economic vitality of the dairy industry by stabilizing the price received by farmers for their milk at a level allowing them an equitable rate of return.
    These purposes are to be accomplished through regulation of the milk-marketing industry, and through control in general, consistent with constitutional limitations, of the price of all fluid dairy products sold or offered or exposed for sale to the inhabitants of this State and by Vermont farmers, to the end that the public health and economic welfare of the State shall not be menaced or jeopardized.

       The Commission may make, rescind, or amend an order regulating minimum producer prices if the Commission finds that the federal milk marketing order minimum price is adequate or inadequate as the case may be to ensure that the price paid to dairy producers will cover the costs of milk production and provide a reasonable economic return to dairy producers sufficient to ensure a stable milk production and distribution system in Vermont.

       Guidelines for setting prices.
    
    In setting equitable minimum prices, the Commission may investigate and ascertain what are reasonable costs and charges for producing, hauling, handling, processing, and any other services performed in respect to dairy products. The Commission shall take into consideration the balance between production and consumption of dairy products, the costs of production and distribution, the purchasing power of the public, and the price necessary to yield a reasonable return to the producers, handlers, and distributors.

         Minimum producer prices may be based on the producer prices prevailing in federal market order I and reflect as accurately as possible the costs of production in Vermont.

    Minimum producer prices should also reflect the actual rate of return received by distributors or handlers, whichever is greater, as determined by the Commission.

        Evidence tending to show that compliance with an order of the Milk Control Board raising the price of milk so that many poor families would not be able to purchase as much milk as before or in some cases might be unable to purchase milk when there had been no change in the supply of milk available for sale did not support a finding of a loss or substantial lessening of the supply of milk but on the contrary tended to create the resulting lessening of availability of milk which the action of the Milk Control Board was calculated to prevent.

        Although Dairy Industry Income Stabilization Program (DIISP) had expired, claim of dairy farmers that DIISP's exclusion of farmers who were not members of a cooperative violated 42 U.S.C.
        §
        1983 was not moot because a live controversy remained concerning whether plaintiffs suffered monetary loss because of an illegal application of DIISP and plaintiffs filed suit long before DIISP expired. Heleba v. Allbee, 160 Vt. 283, 628 A.2d 1237 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Dairy farmers who were not members of a cooperative did not establish that Commissioner of Agriculture and State Treasurer acted in bad faith by rejecting farmers' applications for inclusion in Dairy Industry Income Stabilization Program (DIISP) after farmers initiated a lawsuit; mere initiation of lawsuit did not create a clearly established right to participate in DIISP. Heleba v. Allbee, 160 Vt. 283, 628 A.2d 1237 (1992).

        Where statute provided that dairy farmers who were not members of a regional marketing cooperative were not eligible for a Dairy Industry Income Stabilization Program (DIISP) subsidy, Commissioner of Agriculture and State Treasurer could not be sued in their individual capacities for rejecting DIISP applications of farmers who were not members of cooperatives. Heleba v. Allbee, 160 Vt. 283, 628 A.2d 1237 (1992).

     <p>
      Meat, meat food products, poultry, and poultry products are an important source of the State's total supply of food.
    They are consumed throughout the State.
    It is essential to the public interest that the health and welfare of consumers be protected by assuring that these commodities are wholesome, unadulterated, and properly marked, labeled, and packaged. Unwholesome, adulterated, or misbranded meat, meat food products, and poultry products impair the effective regulation of intrastate commerce, are injurious to the public welfare, destroy markets for wholesome, not adulterated and properly labeled and packaged meat, meat food product, and poultry product, as well as cause injury to consumers.
    The unwholesome, adulterated, mislabeled, or deceptively packaged articles can be sold at lower prices and compete unfairly with the wholesome, unadulterated, correctly labeled, or nondeceptively packaged articles, to the detriment of consumers and the public generally.
    It is hereby found that the regulation, enforcement, licensing, and other provisions contained within this chapter are necessary to protect the health and welfare of consumers.

     <p>
      It is the objective of this chapter to provide for meat and poultry products inspection programs that will impose and enforce requirements with respect to intrastate operations and commerce that are at least equal to those imposed and enforced under the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Federal Poultry Products Inspection Act with respect to operations and transactions in interstate commerce.
    In addition, it is the further objective of this chapter to provide for licensing, and periodic review of establishments, such as retail vendors, custom licensed establishments, and wholesale distributors, which are not subject to traditional inspection under the Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Federal Poultry Products Inspection Act.
    In this way the public will be better protected from uninspected, adulterated, unwholesome, mislabeled, or otherwise illegal meat and poultry products. The Secretary is directed to administer this chapter so as to accomplish these purposes.
    The Agency of Agriculture, Food and Markets is designated as the appropriate State agency to cooperate with the Secretary of Agriculture of the United States and to administer this chapter.

       The report issued by the Council on the Future of Vermont indicates that over 97 percent of Vermonters polled endorsed the value of the "working landscape" as key to our future.
      </li>
      <li id="t06p10c207sub02s4603ol12">
       Vermont's unique agricultural and forest assets - its working landscape - are crucial to the State's economy, communities, character, and culture. These assets provide jobs, food and fiber, energy, security, tourism and recreational opportunities, and a sense of well-being. They contribute to Vermont's reputation for quality, resilience, and self-reliance.
      </li>
      <li id="t06p10c207sub02s4603ol13">
       Human activity involving Vermont's agricultural and forestland has been integral to the development of Vermont's economy, culture, and image. Sustainable land use will need to balance economic development demands with the other services the land provides, many of which have economic benefits beyond the agriculture and forest product sectors. Some of these benefits include clean air and water, recreational opportunities, ecosystem restoration, scenic vistas, and wildlife habitat.
      </li>
      <li id="t06p10c207sub02s4603ol14">
       The agriculture and forest product sectors are similar and share many of the same challenges. There are potential benefits to be realized by the joining of these sectors in development planning and coordination, making policy decisions, and leveraging economic opportunities.
      </li>
      <li id="t06p10c207sub02s4603ol15">
       The agriculture and forest product sectors provide renewable and harvestable products that form the basis of Vermont's land-based economy. The conversion of these raw commodities into value-added products within our borders represents further economic and employment opportunities.
      </li>
      <li id="t06p10c207sub02s4603ol16">
       Vermont is in the midst of an agricultural renaissance and is at the forefront of the local foods movement. Success has been due to the efforts of skilled and dedicated farmers, creative entrepreneurs, and the strategic investment of private and public funds.
      </li>
      <li id="t06p10c207sub02s4603ol17">
       State investment in a given industry or economic sector is often essential to stimulate and attract additional private and philanthropic investment. The combination of public, private, and foundation support can create enterprise opportunities that any one of them alone cannot. Grants issued as a result of 2011 Acts and Resolves, No. 52 helped create jobs and economic activity in the agricultural sector. They also leveraged private and foundation investments.
      </li>
      <li id="t06p10c207sub02s4603ol18">
       Vermont's land-based economy has proven to be a driver for Vermont's ongoing economic recovery.
      </li>
      <li id="t06p10c207sub02s4603ol19">
       Value-added and specialty Vermont products are a growing source of revenue for Vermont's agricultural producers, many of whom have benefited from the existing infrastructure requirements of commodity producers. Both export and instate markets are necessary options for the agriculture and forest product sectors' economic development.
      </li>
      <li id="t06p10c207sub02s4603ol110">
       The Vermont brand is highly regarded both nationally and internationally. Forest management is seen as crop management by those active in the forest product industry. An actively managed forest is a healthy and productive one.
      </li>
      <li id="t06p10c207sub02s4603ol111">
       Vermont's agriculture and forest product sectors have not been perceived or treated as businesses by the traditional business and lending communities. They often lack available capital and financial package options that match their stage of development.
      </li>
      <li id="t06p10c207sub02s4603ol112">
       Financial service and workforce development programs need to be customized to meet the unique needs of Vermont's agriculture and forest product sectors. Landowner education and labor skills training are also important for future productive management of forestlands.
      </li>
      <li id="t06p10c207sub02s4603ol113">
       Scale is an important determining factor for the successful development of businesses that utilize Vermont's agriculture and forest products. Other limiting factors include labor and transportation costs, support services, resource base, and the regulatory environment.
      </li>
      <li id="t06p10c207sub02s4603ol114">
       Workers' compensation, health care, energy costs, and regulatory requirements are a major concern to the agriculture and forest product sectors. For example, workers' compensation premiums for loggers may run as high as 48 percent of each dollar of wages.
      </li>
      <li id="t06p10c207sub02s4603ol115">
       The amount of land in Vermont is finite, and part of its community and economic value is tied to the way it is used. Farmland and forestland that are developed for other uses affect the future viability of remaining farms and forest enterprises.
      </li>
      <li id="t06p10c207sub02s4603ol116">
       A forestland owner is often not the person actively engaged in the business of land management, such as planning, harvesting, or marketing the raw product, whereas in agricultural operations, the farmer often owns both the land and the business. Many farm operations have woodlots that have traditionally been used for syrup, timber, and firewood production.
      </li>
      <li id="t06p10c207sub02s4603ol117">
       Vermonters' perception of and support for local wood and forest products are not at the same level as they are for local food. Public outreach and education efforts need to be created to address the public's perception of actively managed working lands and the people who perpetuate them. Over the last decade, consumers of wood products have become more interested in production and management methods, certification programs, and the source of the raw materials.
      </li>
      <li id="t06p10c207sub02s4603ol118">
       Vermont's forest products industry has been in decline for many years, in part due to rising costs, a poor housing market, and a lack of manufacturing. The total value of the forest product industry has dropped from $1.8 billion to $1.3 billion since 2007. If wood chips were priced at the equivalent BTU replacement value of oil, they would command a higher price. The number of active sawmills has also declined to fewer than 20 today.
      </li>
      <li id="t06p10c207sub02s4603ol119">
       The average age of Vermont's farmers and loggers is over 55 years of age and the average age of forestland owners is over 65. Attention needs to be brought to efforts that will ensure intergenerational succession and lower those averages. Economically viable farm- and forest-based operations are critical to that goal. "Legacy" skills such as farming and logging are disappearing, as the children of those making a living from those skills often aspire to different employment opportunities.
      </li>
      <li id="t06p10c207sub02s4603ol120">
       Access to land is a challenge for many, especially younger, people who want the opportunity to make a living from productive use of the land. Farm and forestland ownership is often out of reach for young people who do not have some sort of assistance.
      </li>
      <li id="t06p10c207sub02s4603ol121">
       The Vermont forest product sector contains approximately 7,000 jobs, and approximately 57,000 jobs are in Vermont's food system.
      </li>
      <li id="t06p10c207sub02s4603ol122">
       Regulations for forest product enterprises need to reflect a balance between economic development and responsible land use practices. There is a need to assess regulations involving the primary processing and transportation elements of the forest product sector.
      </li>
      <li id="t06p10c207sub02s4603ol123">
       Seventy-six percent of Vermont's 4.5 million acres is forested, 84 percent of which is privately owned. Sustainable management of State-owned forestlands represents an opportunity for private sector forest businesses.
      </li>
      <li id="t06p10c207sub02s4603ol124">
       Forest product sector representatives have identified needs for their industry, including market development, additional secondary processing facilities, lower energy and transportation costs, and capital for growth enterprises as well as research and development for new and improved value-added products that make use of Vermont's forest resources. Factors such as health care, labor, and energy policies in Canada contribute to the northward flow of Vermont logs. Research is needed in order to develop strategies that will help keep Vermont's forest product sector competitive.
      </li>
      <li id="t06p10c207sub02s4603ol125">
       Vermont's Use Value Appraisal (Current Use) Program is critically important to every component of Vermont's agriculture and forest product sectors. It also helps keep Vermont forestland productive and healthy through the requirement of active forest management plans.

      It is the purpose of this chapter to ensure that agricultural animal wastes do not enter the waters of this State. Therefore, it is State policy that:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t06p10c215sub01s4801ol11">
       All farms meet certain standards in the handling and disposal of animal wastes, as provided by this chapter, and the cost of meeting these standards shall not be borne by farmers only, but rather by all members of society, who are in fact the beneficiaries. Accordingly, State and federal funds shall be made available to farms, regardless of size, to defray the major cost of complying with the requirements of this chapter. State and federal conservation programs to assist farmers should be directed to those farms that need to improve their infrastructure to prohibit direct discharges or bring existing water pollution control structures into compliance with U.S. Department of Agriculture (U.S.D.A.) Natural Resources Conservation Service standards. Additional resources should be directed to education and technical assistance for farmers to improve the management of agricultural wastes and protect water quality.

     Required Agricultural Practices.
    </b>
    Required Agricultural Practices (RAPs) shall be management standards to be followed by all persons engaged in farming in this State. These standards shall address activities which have a potential for causing agricultural pollutants to enter the groundwater and waters of the State, including dairy and other livestock operations plus all forms of crop and nursery operations and on-farm or agricultural fairground, registered pursuant to <cite class="vt-code">20 V.S.A. § 3902</cite>, livestock and poultry slaughter and processing activities. The RAPs shall include, as well as promote and encourage, practices for farmers in preventing agricultural pollutants from entering the groundwater and waters of the State when engaged in animal waste management and disposal, soil amendment applications, plant fertilization, and pest and weed control. Persons engaged in farming who are in compliance with these practices shall be presumed to not have a discharge of agricultural pollutants to waters of the State. RAPs shall be designed to protect water quality and shall be practical and cost-effective to implement, as determined by the Secretary. Where the Secretary determines, after inspection of a farm, that a person engaged in farming is complying with the RAPs but there still exists the potential for agricultural pollutants to enter the waters of the State, the Secretary shall require the person to implement additional, site-specific on-farm conservation practices designed to prevent agricultural pollutants from entering the waters of the State. When requiring implementation of a conservation practice under this subsection, the Secretary shall inform the person engaged in farming of the resources available to assist the person in implementing the conservation practice and complying with the requirements of this chapter. The RAPs for groundwater shall include a process under which the Agency shall receive, investigate, and respond to a complaint that a farm has contaminated the drinking water or groundwater of a property owner. A farmer may petition the Secretary to reduce the size of a perennial buffer or change the perennial buffer type based on site-specific conditions.

     Best Management Practices.
    </b>
    Best management practices (BMPs) are site-specific on-farm conservation practices implemented in order to address the potential for agricultural pollutants to enter the waters of the State. The Secretary may require any person engaged in farming to implement a BMP. When requiring implementation of a BMP, the Secretary shall inform a farmer of financial resources available from State or federal sources, private foundations, public charities, or other sources, including funding from the Clean Water Fund established under <cite class="vt-code">10 V.S.A. § 1388</cite>, to assist the person in implementing BMPs and complying with the requirements of this chapter. BMPs shall be practical and cost effective to implement, as determined by the Secretary, and shall be designed to achieve compliance with the requirements of this chapter. The Secretary may require soil monitoring or innovative manure management as a BMP under this subsection. Soil monitoring or innovative manure management implemented as a BMP shall be eligible for State assistance under the Clean Water Fund established under 10 V.S.A. chapter 47, subchapter 7. If a perennial buffer of trees or other woody vegetation is required as a BMP, the Secretary shall pay the farmer for a first priority easement on the land on which the buffer is located.

     Cooperation and coordination.
    </b>
    The Secretary of Agriculture, Food and Markets shall coordinate with the Secretary of Natural Resources in implementing and enforcing programs, plans, and practices developed for reducing and eliminating agricultural non-point source pollutants and discharges from concentrated animal feeding operations. On or before July 1, 2016, the Secretary of Agriculture, Food and Markets and the Secretary of Natural Resources shall revise the memorandum of understanding for the non-point program describing program administration, grant negotiation, grant sharing, and how they will coordinate watershed planning activities to comply with Pub. L. No. 92-500. The memorandum of understanding shall describe how the agencies will implement the antidegradation implementation policy, including how the agencies will apply the antidegradation implementation policy to new sources of agricultural non-point source pollutants. The Secretary of Agriculture, Food and Markets and the Secretary of Natural Resources shall also develop a memorandum of understanding according to the public notice and comment process of <cite class="vt-code">10 V.S.A. § 1259(i)</cite> regarding the implementation of the federal Concentrated Animal Feeding Operation Program and the relationship between the requirements of the federal Program and the State agricultural water quality requirements for large, medium, and small farms under this chapter. The memorandum of understanding shall describe Program administration, permit issuance, an appellate process, and enforcement authority and implementation. The memorandum of understanding shall be consistent with the federal National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System permit regulations for discharges from concentrated animal feeding operations. The allocation of duties under this chapter between the Secretary of Agriculture, Food and Markets and the Secretary of Natural Resources shall be consistent with the Secretary's duties, established under the provisions of <cite class="vt-code">10 V.S.A. § 1258(b)</cite>, to comply with Pub. L. No. 92-500. The Secretary of Natural Resources shall be the State lead person in applying for federal funds under Pub. L. No. 92-500, but shall consult with the Secretary of Agriculture, Food and Markets during the process. The agricultural non-point source program may compete with other programs for competitive watershed projects funded from federal funds. The Secretary of Agriculture, Food and Markets shall be represented in reviewing these projects for funding. Actions by the Secretary of Agriculture, Food and Markets under this chapter concerning agricultural non-point source pollution shall be consistent with the water quality standards and water pollution control requirements of 10 V.S.A. chapter 47 and the federal Clean Water Act as amended. In addition, the Secretary of Agriculture, Food and Markets shall coordinate with the Secretary of Natural Resources in implementing and enforcing programs, plans, and practices developed for the proper management of composting facilities when those facilities are located on a farm. On or before January 15, 2016, the Secretary of Agriculture, Food and Markets and the Secretary of Natural Resources shall each develop three separate measures of the performance of the agencies under the memorandum of understanding required by this subsection. Beginning on January 15, 2017, and annually thereafter, the Secretary of Agriculture, Food and Markets and the Secretary of Natural Resources shall submit separate reports to the Senate Committee on Agriculture, the House Committee on Agriculture and Forestry, the Senate Committee on Natural Resources and Energy, and the House Committee on Natural Resources, Fish, and Wildlife regarding the success of each agency in meeting the performance measures for the memorandum of understanding.
