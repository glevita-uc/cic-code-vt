        Notwithstanding the exception in this section relating to the dispensing of alcoholic beverages by a person in his private dwelling, a minor furnishing alcoholic beverages to other minors in his private dwelling would be in direct violation of the provisions of section 658 of this title, which prohibits the furnishing of alcoholic beverages to minors by any person. 1964-66 Op.

        Under provision that one shall not "furnish or sell" intoxicating liquor, except that this prohibition "shall not apply to the furnishing of" such liquor by a person in his private dwelling, except in certain specified instances, the words "sell" and "furnish" have different significations: "furnish" and "furnishing" mean to supply or provide in any other way than by sale, and it is unlawful for a person to sell liquor in his private dwelling under circumstances in which it would be lawful for him to furnish it without financial gain.

The General Assembly also finds that unattended drinks can be compromised with the insertion of drugs and other foreign substances. While there may be concern about the safety of holding drinks while dancing, the vulnerability of unattended drinks is a far greater safety hazard to patrons. This act will permit patrons to maintain control of their drinks while at the licensed premises."

       <p>
        Where the Legislature has intended licensing agencies to aid in the enforcement of unrelated laws, it has specifically authorized such activity. There is, however, no statute authorizing licensing agencies generally or liquor control commissions in particular to suspend a liquor license for failure to comply with municipal ordinances unrelated to intoxicating liquor, such as entertainment and public-indecency ordinances. SBC Enterprises, Inc. v. City of South Burlington Liquor Control Commission, 166 Vt. 79, 689 A.2d 427 (1996).

       <p>
        Regulation of Liquor Control Board prohibiting obscene, lewd, or indecent entertainment at licensed establishments was beyond Board's authority and was thus invalid. In re Club 107, 152 Vt. 320, 566 A.2d 966 (1989).

        Because the Department of Liquor Control is expressly authorized to enforce Vermont's liquor control laws, no interpretive rule is necessary to outline specific guidelines that must be followed in looking for violations. State v. Wuerslin, 174 Vt. 570, 816 A.2d 445 (mem.) (2002).

         9. Regulatory authority.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Department of Liquor Control General Regulation 17 (GR 17) specifically ties together loitering with the state of intoxication, bringing it squarely within the Liquor Control Board's purview; there is the necessary nexus between the regulation and the consequences of excessive use of alcohol because the regulation prevents licensees from allowing only intoxicated people to idle at their establishments, which are places where intoxicated people may pose a threat to themselves and to public safety. Although GR 17 uses the word "loiter," which has a definition and connotation unrelated to the consumption of alcohol, the regulation prohibits the licensee from tolerating only intoxicated loitering and so directly relates to the Board's enabling legislation. In re Rusty Nail Acquisition, 186 Vt. 195, 980 A.2d 758 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Removing intoxicated patrons from a licensed establishment furthers the Liquor Control Board's mandate to facilitate sales of alcoholic beverage in such a manner as to discourage intoxication and encourage temperance, encourages patrons to consume moderately to avoid being ejected, reduces the likelihood of further consumption by those who appear already intoxicated, and promotes the general welfare by removing intoxicated persons from the confines of an establishment where they may pose a threat to other people's safety; further, given the nature of licensed establishments as highly regulated environments, the Board's authority should be construed broadly when applied to regulating the presence of intoxicated persons within such establishments. Accordingly, Department of Liquor Control General Regulation 17 does not exceed the Board's enabling legislation. In re Rusty Nail Acquisition, 186 Vt. 195, 980 A.2d 758 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Department of Liquor Control General Regulation 17 (GR 17) does not attempt to regulate loitering generally in contravention of the Liquor Control Board's statutory authority to regulate only intoxicating liquors. Under GR 17, the Board does not place conditions on licensees forcing them to prohibit loitering generally at their establishments; instead, the regulation forbids licensees from allowing patrons to loiter when they appear intoxicated, which is well within the power delegated to the Board. In re Rusty Nail Acquisition, 186 Vt. 195, 980 A.2d 758 (2009).

        This section, which gives the liquor control commission broad authority to control the conduct of liquor licensees and to discipline for proscribed conduct, must be read in conjunction with section 814 of Title 3, the provision of Administrative Procedure Act governing procedures relative to suspension or revocation of licenses, which specifically envisions situations where a license is to be renewed, but subject to limiting terms. In re Judy Ann's Inc., 143 Vt. 228, 464 A.2d 752 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Liquor control commission had authority to suspend and attach limitations to plaintiff's renewed liquor licenses for violations which occurred during the term of the previous year's licenses, notwithstanding the fact that this section provided that the commission had power to suspend such licenses for violations which occurred during "the term thereof," since to interpret this section literally would result in irrational consequences, in that violations occurring near April 30, the date when all liquor licenses expire pursuant to section 232 of this title, would either have to be dealt with immediately, which would be impossible under the hearing provisions of sections 801-847 of Title 3, the Administrative Procedure Act, or not at all. In re Judy Ann's Inc., 143 Vt. 228, 464 A.2d 752 (1983).

       </h5>
       <p>
        In taking steps to revoke a license allowing the sale of intoxicating liquors, the control commissioners act as a tribunal in carrying out a judicial function and in such case they are immune from civil liability. Verrill v. Dewey, 130 Vt. 627, 299 A.2d 182 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where control commissioners revoked a license without previous hearing by the Liquor Control Board, they acted in excess of their authority rather than in clear absence of authority, but their actions were well within the protection of immunity for the exercise of judicial functions. Verrill v. Dewey, 130 Vt. 627, 299 A.2d 182 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Liquor Control Board, when passing upon question whether license shall be revoked for violation of liquor act or regulation, sits as tribunal with judicial function to perform. In re Wakefield, 107 Vt. 180, 177 A. 319 (1935).

         3. Suspension.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where Liquor Control Board found that an employee of licensee sold beer to a sixteen-year-old and that licensee conceded the fact of the sale, these findings were sufficient to support its decision to suspend licensee's second class license for a period of ten days, and unsupported finding of the Board that licensee had been issued three letters of warning by the Department of Liquor Control regarding sales to minors, even if error, was harmless. In re Handy, 144 Vt. 610, 481 A.2d 1051 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        The mere fact the liquor control commission voted to suspend appellant's liquor licenses for fifteen days, after hearing unrefuted testimony of at least four infractions of Liquor Board regulations, did not provide evidence that members of the commission were biased against appellant. In re Judy Ann's Inc., 143 Vt. 228, 464 A.2d 752 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Control commissioners have authority under this section to impose a penalty of license suspension without referral to the Liquor Control Board. Verrill v. Dewey, 130 Vt. 627, 299 A.2d 182 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where alcoholic beverage statutes do not provide for a hearing in case of suspension of license, licensee is bound by acceptance of license and such license may be temporarily suspended without a hearing. Verrill v. Daley, 126 Vt. 444, 236 A.2d 238 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where licensee has not been convicted by a court of violating liquor laws, control commissioners may, without hearing, suspend a license only for a definite and limited period of time, such period being limited to such time as would give opportunity for due notice to be given for hearing upon revocation of license, if such is called for. 1938-40 Op. Atty. Gen. 285.

         4. Revocation.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where liquor licenses were revoked for violation of State Liquor Control Board's regulation prohibiting the furnishing or sale of alcoholic liquor to a minor and licensee had, in the past, been found guilty of violating board regulations, claim by licensee that a short period of suspension would be in keeping with punishments ordered in like cases, and more consistent with the nature of the particular violation given that the minor was over seventeen years of age at the time she was served alcohol by licensee's bartender, did not demonstrate an abuse of discretion. In re Johnston, 145 Vt. 318, 488 A.2d 750 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Control commissioners did not have authority to revoke license without a hearing and decision by the Liquor Control Board. Verrill v. Daley, 126 Vt. 444, 236 A.2d 238 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Generally, where, as in this section, a statute, by its terms, requires notice and hearing before a liquor or beer license may be revoked, compliance with the statutory requirement is a prerequisite of the validity of the order of revocation; a disregard of these requirements is a jurisdictional defect. Verrill v. Daley, 126 Vt. 444, 236 A.2d 238 (1967).

         7. Review.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Supreme Court review of revocation of liquor licenses by State Liquor Control Board was limited to whether, on the record developed before the Board, there was any reasonable basis for the Board's actions. In re Johnston, 145 Vt. 318, 488 A.2d 750 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        To win reversal of an order revoking a liquor license, a matter committed to the discretion of the Liquor Control Board, the licensee must show an abuse of discretion which caused prejudice. In re Johnston, 145 Vt. 318, 488 A.2d 750 (1985).

       </h5>
       <p>
        A license for the sale of intoxicating liquor is a privilege which the state may grant to some and deny to others. Carousel Grill Inc. v. Liquor Control Board, 123 Vt. 93, 182 A.2d 336 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        No right attaches to a license to sell intoxicating liquor, it being at most a privilege which of necessity is subordinate to the public interest and the police power of the state. Carousel Grill Inc. v. Liquor Control Board, 123 Vt. 93, 182 A.2d 336 (1962).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Control commissioners may, in their discretion, disapprove an application even though all minimum requirements of law have been met, provided there is sufficient evidence considered by them at time of exercising discretion to support their action. 1946-48 Op. Atty. Gen. 191, 207.
       </p>
       <p>
        Duty of control commissioners, when application is made for license, involves exercise of a wise discretion, is quasi judicial in character, and the discharge of it cannot be controlled by mandamus. State ex rel. Billado v. Control Commissioners, 114 Vt. 350, 45 A.2d 430 (1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        Discretion as to the granting of licenses may lawfully be delegated to public officials without prescribing definite rules of action, not, however, to be exercised arbitrarily. State ex rel. Billado v. Control Commissioners, 114 Vt. 350, 45 A.2d 430 (1946).

        Subsection (a) of this section requires that the dispensing of food as meals to the public be performed by the licensee, and it is therefore improper for the dispensing of food and the dispensing of intoxicating beverages to be separated so that a party other than the licensee conducts the former. 1946-48 Op. Atty. Gen. 182.

       <p>
        Where the holder of first class license turns the conduct of restaurant for which he holds such license over to another party, there is a violation of the terms of the license. 1946-48 Op. Atty. Gen. 182.

        The condition placed upon a liquor license requiring the husband of the sole director and stockholder of licensee to remain off the premises was reasonably related to licensee's fitness to conduct its business, and did not unconstitutionally interfere with licensee's ability to operate its business, because it was designed to protect the public's safety, health and morals, given the fact that the husband was convicted of two drug offenses, including one that took place on or very near the premises and involved one of licensee's vehicles.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Under plain language of statute as well as previous decisions, relatives of a deceased imbiber have an independent and direct right of recovery under Dram Shop Act. Thompson v. Dewey's South Royalton, Inc., 169 Vt. 274, 733 A.2d 65 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        The word "furnishing," as used in the Dram Shop Act, connotes possession or control of an alcoholic beverage by the furnisher. Carrick v. Franchise Assocs., 164 Vt. 418, 671 A.2d 1243 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The wording of 7 V.S.A.
        §
        501(f) is clear and unambiguous, in the context of the whole statute, and authorizes contribution. Swett v. Haig's, Inc., 164 Vt. 1, 663 A.2d 930 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The intoxicated driver is a person responsible for the injuries to the other motorist, although the common law creates that responsibility rather than the Dram Shop Act, and there is nothing in 7 V.S.A.
        §
        501(f), or the Act as a whole, to suggest that the Legislature used the word "responsible" in other than its ordinary and plain meaning especially given that the Legislature used the phrase "defendant in an action brought under this section" in subsection (f), showing that it knew how to limit its action to Dram Shop Act defendants when that was clear but it did not express such an intent in defining the responsible person from whom contribution could be sought. Swett v. Haig's, Inc., 164 Vt. 1, 663 A.2d 930 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Support for Supreme Court's holding that contribution may be sought from the intoxicated driver for damages a dram shop may be required to pay a motorist injured in an accident with the intoxicated driver can be found in the fact that each of the bills that led to the 1987 amendment to the Dram Shop Act had as one of its two main purposes to limit liability under the dram shop law, as allowing a dram shop to obtain contribution would limit a dram shop's eventual liability. Swett v. Haig's, Inc., 164 Vt. 1, 663 A.2d 930 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Dram Shop Act preempts common-law negligence actions that come within its scope. Swett v. Haig's, Inc., 164 Vt. 1, 663 A.2d 930 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the preemptive effect of the Dram Shop Act is limited, an accident in which a third party is injured can give rise to common-law negligence liability as well as liability against the dram shop under the Act, so that an injured motorist may bring a common-law negligence action against the intoxicated driver, and a claim against the dram shop can be joined with the claim against the intoxicated driver, or the intoxicated driver can sue the dram shop for the driver's damages on a common-law negligence theory. Swett v. Haig's, Inc., 164 Vt. 1, 663 A.2d 930 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Dram Shop Act does not preempt all common-law negligence actions for those suffering damages based on the furnishing or selling of alcoholic beverages. Estate of Kelley v. Moguls, Inc., 160 Vt. 531, 632 A.2d 360 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Dram Shop Act preempts those common-law negligence actions that come within its scope. Estate of Kelley v. Moguls, Inc., 160 Vt. 531, 632 A.2d 360 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Liability under dram shop statute is not based on negligence. Plante v. Johnson, 152 Vt. 270, 565 A.2d 1346 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Dram Shop Act does not preclude a negligence action against the intoxicated person. Plante v. Johnson, 152 Vt. 270, 565 A.2d 1346 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section provides the exclusive remedy for cases falling within its scope, and preempts a cause of action in common law negligence. Winney v. Ransom & Hastings, Inc., 149 Vt. 213, 542 A.2d 269 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section gives a cause of action only to third persons who are injured by an intoxicated person. Langle v. Kurkul, 146 Vt. 513, 510 A.2d 1301 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section provides no remedy to the imbiber, whether he be a customer of a commercial vendor or a guest of a social host, to recover for subsequent injuries to himself as the result of his consumption of too much alcohol. Langle v. Kurkul, 146 Vt. 513, 510 A.2d 1301 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not purport to cover all the possible rights and remedies flowing from intoxication-related injuries. Langle v. Kurkul, 146 Vt. 513, 510 A.2d 1301 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not foreclose a cause of action for negligence. Langle v. Kurkul, 146 Vt. 513, 510 A.2d 1301 (1986).

        The Dram Shop Act imposes strict liability for injuries to third parties on dram shops that serve persons apparently under the influence of intoxicating liquor or where the person served is a minor, the person is served after legal serving hours, or where it would be reasonable to expect that the person served would be under the influence of intoxicating liquor as a result of the amount of liquor served.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Although 7 V.S.A.
        §
        501(f) states that the dram shop's right to contribution may be enforced in a separate action brought for that purpose,
    nothing in the language suggests that a separate action is the exclusive method of enforcing the right; in wording the statute as it did, the Legislature acted to ensure that contribution could be sought in a separate action, and not that it intended to prohibit use of third-party practice. Swett v. Haig's, Inc., 164 Vt. 1, 663 A.2d 930 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though allowing contribution from an intoxicated driver to a dram shop held responsible for a motorist's injuries due to an accident with the intoxicated driver introduces complexities because the different tortfeasors' liability is based on different theories, much of the complexity would be present even if the Supreme Court were to deny the availability of contribution, and the courts can be trusted to treat the injured motorist fairly while allowing contribution as authorized by 7 V.S.A.

        Where franchise agreement merely provided that franchisor had the right to prescribe and approve standards of service but plaintiff offered no evidence that defendants had actually prescribed such standards, or if they had, that those standards included training bartenders in the proper exercise of discretion in serving alcoholic beverages, the franchise agreement failed to demonstrate that franchisors exercised such control over the operation of the franchise and lounge located in it that liability for overserving intoxicated driver could be laid directly at their doors.

        Because she was born alive, a child's fetal status at the time of her father's death did not preclude her, as a matter of law, from recovering under the Dram Shop Act. Her claim accrued when she was injured, and she was injured under the act when she was born alive and deprived of her father as a means of support; thus, at the time her claim accrued, she was a "child" for purposes of the act and entitled to bring a claim thereunder.

       </p>
       <p>
        Because the Dram Shop Act contains its own limitations provision and is not codified in the chapter governing limitation of actions, an action under the Act is "otherwise specially limited" and removed from the operation of the minority tolling provision by the statute stating that provisions of the chapter governing limitation of actions "shall not affect an action otherwise specially limited by law."

       </p>
       <p>
        Discovery rule did not require that plaintiff obtain proof of motorist's being overserved in order for dram shop claim to accrue; rather, plaintiff's claim accrued once he learned that motorist had been drinking at defendant's establishment and had been charged with DWI in connection with accident.

        To arrest without a warrant for public intoxication, additional element of disturbing the public or domestic peace and tranquility had to be present. State v. Adams, 131 Vt. 413, 306 A.2d 92 (1973), overruled on other grounds, State v. Dacey (1980) 138 Vt. 491, 418 A.2d 856; State v.

        Fact that Indian tribe's independent shipper was responsible for obtaining a proper liquor transport permit did not protect tribe from forfeiture of its liquor under liquor control laws; Legislature's explicit provision of an innocent owner defense solely for owner of conveyance used in illegal transportation of liquor demonstrated that Legislature did not intend such a defense for owner of liquor being unlawfully transported.

       <p>
        Statute governing forfeiture of unlawfully transported liquor was not unconstitutionally vague; constitutional prohibition did not apply, where Indian tribe whose liquor was forfeited did not argue that relevant prohibition was vague, but that remedy statute was vague, and court would not extend void-for-vagueness rule to scope of a remedy.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Remedy of forfeiture was applicable to liquor being transported by Indian tribe without a proper liquor transport permit, since liquor was "being smuggled, delivered or transported contrary to law" within meaning of liquor control statutes, and fact that illegal transport of liquor was also a crime did not mean Legislature intended that forfeiture not be available as a sanction.

        Because Department of Liquor Control monitoring does not involve the detention or search of bartenders, no written guidelines are necessary to legitimate its undercover operations to enforce prohibitions on furnishing alcohol to minors. State v. Wuerslin, 174 Vt. 570, 816 A.2d 445 (mem.) (2002).

       <p>
        Term "knowingly" modifies the age element of the statute which prohibits enabling the consumption of alcohol by a minor. Accordingly, the trial court erred in instructing the jury that the State was not required to prove defendant's knowledge that the person he enabled to consume an alcoholic beverage was a minor. State v. Richland, 200 Vt. 401, 132 A.3d 702 (2015).

       <p>
        Trial court's error in instructing the jury that the State was not required to prove defendant's knowledge that the person he enabled to consume an alcoholic beverage was a minor was not harmless, because defendant never expressly admitted that he knew the minor's age and because the jury, as factfinder, was not required to weigh the evidence of defendant's knowledge of the minor's age. State v. Richland, 200 Vt. 401, 132 A.3d 702 (2015).
