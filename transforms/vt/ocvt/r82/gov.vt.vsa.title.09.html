        2233 requires a court to declare a loan unenforceable if the lender received additional monies from a variety of other sources, whether interest, consideration, finance charges, discounts, or other charges, that exceed what is allowed by 9 V.S.A.
        <span class="s1">
         ยง
        </span>
        41a(d). That statute is not limited to an excess rate of interest, but rather encompasses excessive interest, consideration, and charges collected vis a vis the outstanding balance. Ag Venture Fin. Servs. v. Montagne (In re Montagne), 421 B.R. 65 (Bankr. D. Vt. 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether a transaction is usurious was not to be determined by its form; rather, the whole transaction and the interest of the parties, particularly the lender, were to be gathered from all the circumstances and events which preceded and accompanied the transaction. Brown v. Pilini, 128 Vt. 324, 262 A.2d 479 (1970). (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>
       <p>
        To constitute usury, it was essential that an excess of the legal maximum rate of interest prescribed by this section be exacted in consideration of a loan of forbearance, but the extent of the advantage or the amount of the surplus in excess of legal interest was wholly inconsequential. Farnsworth v. Cochran, 125 Vt. 174, 212 A.2d 818 (1965). (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>
       <p>
        A contract was usurious when any premium, profit, bonus, or charge was exacted or required by the lender in excess of the money actually loaned, which, in addition to the interest stipulated, rendered the return to the lender greater than the lawful rate of interest. Farnsworth v. Cochran, 125 Vt. 174, 212 A.2d 818 (1965). (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>
       <p>
        To constitute a usurious transaction, there must generally be: first, a loan express or implied; second, an agreement that the money or thing loaned shall or may be returned; and, third, an agreement that a greater rate of interest than is allowed by law shall be paid. Gleason v. Childs, 52 Vt. 421 (1880). (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>
       <p>
        To constitute usury, there was required to be an intent, or corrupt agreement, to take illegal interest. Farmers' Bank v. Burchard, 33 Vt. 346 (1860). (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>
       <p>
        The question of usury was divisible: the first matter to be ascertained was whether too great interest had been taken or secured; the next was whether it was done corruptly, or, in other words, with intent to violate the statute. Bank of Burlington v. Durkee, 1 Vt. 399 (1829). (Decided under prior law.)

       </p>
       <p>
        The sale of mortgage securities at a premium could not subject the party to an action to recover back the premium on ground of usury. Culver v. Bigelow, 43 Vt. 249 (1870). (Decided under prior law.)

        Although courts rarely, if ever, as between debtor and creditor, enforce an executory contract for payment of compound interest, yet payment of it is not necessarily in a legal sense payment of a usury; and if a debtor knowingly, understandingly and unconditionally paid it under no peculiar circumstances of oppression, it could be recovered back.

        If the penalty provided in of this section was to be invoked, the debtor was required to prove the transaction was a loan and usurious and also that the lender entered into the contract knowingly or wilfully with a wrongful intent.

     Contractors' lien is purely a creature of statute, and, therefore, cases from other jurisdictions, and even Vermont cases decided prior to present statute, have limited application. Newport Sand & Gravel Co. v. Miller Concrete Construction, Inc., 159 Vt. 66, 614 A.2d 395 (1992).

    <p>
     General intent of mechanics' lien statutes is to provide limited protection for suppliers to construction projects by giving them a tool to secure payment for their products, which is, presumably, part of contract price received by general contractor from owner.

        Mechanics' lien statute states that the lien is imposed on "such improvements and the lot of land on which the same stand," but prevents a lien from extending to "other adjacent lands used for purposes of profit"; the use of the word "other" indicates that the Legislature intended to refer to different land than what was referred to at the beginning of the phrase. Applying the plain language, the Vermont Supreme Court concludes that the phrase simply emphasizes that adjacent land used for profit and not connected to the improvements is exempt from attachment; this phrase is not surplusage, but a clarification to prevent land used for profit but not connected to the improvements from being attached. Birchwood Land Co. v. Ormond Bushey & Sons, Inc., 194 Vt. 478, 82 A.3d 539 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        With regard to a developer's slander of title claim, there was no malice in a contractor's refusal to release certain building lots from a mechanics' lien so that the developer could complete the sales for those lots. Nothing in the mechanics' lien statute requires a contractor to reduce the amount of land validly covered by a lien on the theory that the lien can cover only such land as is equal in value to the outstanding claim. Birchwood Land Co. v. Ormond Bushey & Sons, Inc., 194 Vt. 478, 82 A.3d 539 (2013).

        The reach back of a judgment is not limited by the amount of an attachment, but rather the attached property is encumbered by the full amount of plaintiff's judgment subject to the priority of a contractor's lien and the available equity. Official Unsecured Creditors' Comm. v. Moulton Constr. (In re Rainbow Trust), 216 B.R. 77 (2d Cir. BAP 1997).

       <p>
        Mechanic's lien can exist only when work was done under a contract with one who owned some interest, legal or equitable, in the property, and attaches only to such interest; if the contract was made with an agent, the right to a lien depends upon the scope of the agency. Greene v. McDonald, 70 Vt. 372, 40 A. 1035 (1898).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mechanics' lien is given only to those who contract with the owner of the building, or have a claim against him for their labor, and not to workmen, employed by contractors, and between whom and the owner there is no privity of contract. Greenough, Cook & Co. v. Nichols, 30 Vt. 768 (1858).

        The obligation of the defendant, under a mechanic's lien, is only as to the sum of money, if any, which was due under the contract, but where the contractor has left the work uncompleted and the defendant owes him nothing then there is nothing due the person filing the lien.

        Prelien notice provided for in subsec.

       </p>
       <p>
        Owner of property benefited by supplier's provision of materials to subcontractor was not exempt from interest on supplier's lien award on ground that it unwisely released balance of contract funds to general contractor after it had notice of supplier's claim or on ground that supplier failed to give notice of potential for recovery of interest when it gave notice of principal amount of its lien, as owner was charged with knowledge that interest might be awarded and this section requires only that lienor give notice of its claim for labor or material. Newport Sand & Gravel Co. v. Miller Concrete Construction, Inc., 159 Vt. 66, 614 A.2d 395 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in awarding supplier of construction materials to subcontractor interest from date complaint to enforce lien was filed, where amount owed supplier was undisputed and owner, instead of paying claim, allowed general contractor to post bond in amount of lien and take over litigation so that general contractor could litigate operation of this section. Newport Sand & Gravel Co. v. Miller Concrete Construction, Inc., 159 Vt. 66, 614 A.2d 395 (1992).

        Even though a mechanics' lien had expired, until it was discharged it was required to be disclosed to potential purchasers; thus, assuming plaintiffs' allegations that they had suffered actual damages from the cloud on title created by defendant's lien were true, they met their burden of stating the grounds upon which they were entitled to relief.

        Merely filing, but not perfecting, a mechanics' lien does not involve court process and therefore cannot be the basis for a claim of abuse of process in Vermont. Wharton v. Tri-State Drilling & Boring, 175 Vt. 494, 824 A.2d 531 (mem.) (2003).

        Action under this section is not an ordinary action of creditor against debtor but is action to determine amount due plaintiff which is secured by lien. Goodro v. Tarkey, 112 Vt. 212, 22 A.2d 509 (1941).

       <p>
        Mechanic's lien upon building for labor and materials rests not only upon building itself, but carries with it such right to land on which building stands and which is appurtenant thereto, as is necessary to enable party holding lien to hold, appropriate and use building for all legitimate purposes to which such building might be put, in order to render it available as property in its full value and usefulness. H. Roby & Bros. v. University of Vermont, 36 Vt. 564 (1864).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mechanic's lien stands upon same ground as a mortgage would stand if executed at same time as filing of the claim, and affects existing rights whether legal or equitable, to no greater extent than such mortgage would affect them. Kenny v. Gage, 33 Vt. 302 (1860).

        When an action to enforce contractor's lien is not commenced within the three-month period provided by this section, the lien will be lost. Filter Equipment Co. v. International Business Machines Corp., 142 Vt. 499, 458 A.2d 1091 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under provisions of this section that if payment is not due at the time of filing a memorandum of lien in the town clerk's office of the town where the property is located, the action must be commenced within three months from the time payment becomes due, the property involved must be actually attached within the three-month period, and it is not enough that the suit be merely commenced, since the resulting judgment, when obtained, has the force of a mortgage under section 1925 of this title and a right of foreclosure for nonpayment. Filter Equipment Co. v. International Business Machines Corp., 142 Vt. 499, 458 A.2d 1091 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff filed action under this section to enforce contractor's lien and asking for attachment of defendant's property exactly three months after payment became due for materials it had furnished to defendant's subcontractor for incorporation into a building constructed by defendant, trial court correctly denied the motion for attachment, since the lien had lapsed for lack of perfecting. Filter Equipment Co. v. International Business Machines Corp., 142 Vt. 499, 458 A.2d 1091 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Attachment of property upon which mechanics' lien is claimed is necessary incident to action under this section, and time within which action must be commenced is determined by date on which attachment is made. Goodro v. Tarkey, 112 Vt. 212, 22 A.2d 509 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        In perfecting mechanic's lien under this section, property must be actually attached within the three months; it is not enough that the suit be begun. Piper v. Hoyt, 61 Vt. 539, 17 A. 798 (1889).

      When the owner or manager of a stallion has complied with the requirements of section 2072 of this title, if the owner or person in whose name a mare has been mated with such stallion for breeding purposes disposes of such mare by sale or otherwise before foaling time without first settling with the owner or manager for the service of the stallion, or within 10 days after the disposal of the mare, he or she shall be subject to the same penalties that he or she would be for disposing of a colt encumbered by a lien.
    If such mare is returned for trial to the stallion after three weeks from the date of the last service and found not to have become pregnant and is not again served during that breeding season, the provisions of this section shall not apply to the disposal of such mare.

        Trainer of horses has a common law lien on a horse for its keeping and training during a period for which the horse was committed to him for that purpose with the consent of the owner, and a lien under this section for its keeping without training during a period immediately subsequent.

        Where livestock, which was encumbered by chattel mortgage and also by agister's lien subsequent thereto, was taken from possession of agister by process of law and sold upon mortgage, any balance remaining in hands of officer after satisfaction of the mortgage belonged to agister up to amount of his lien.

        Oral assignment of chose in action operates as an equitable transfer, and when followed by notice thereof from assignee to debtor, will be protected and enforced by courts of law against subsequent attachment by trustee process. Noyes v. Brown, 33 Vt. 431 (1860).

       <p>
        Assignment purporting to be for the benefit of all the creditors of the assignor was not invalid on ground of preference when real estate was conveyed to the assignee subject to attachments, which were prior liens thereon. Hilliard v. Burlington Shoe Co., 76 Vt. 57, 56 A. 283 (1903).

        Assignment of portion of debtor's property for benefit of part only of his creditors was not assignment "for the benefit of creditors" within the meaning and operation of this section. Passumpsic Bank v. Strong, 42 Vt. 295 (1869).

        Assignee was not so interested in provisions of assignment as to invalidate it against creditors, simply because as attorney he had caused attachments to be placed upon property, subject to which assignment was made. Hilliard v. Burlington Shoe Co., 76 Vt. 57, 56 A. 283 (1903).

       <p>
        Where one of defendants assigned his assets to three other defendants, but the assignees were also creditors, the assignment was void as against other creditors, unless they assented thereto. Farrar, Burt & Co. v. Powell, 71 Vt. 247, 44 A. 344 (1899).

         1. Intent.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The fraud of a voluntary grantor may be an actual fraudulent purpose, or the fraud which the law implicates to him from the condition of his estate and the necessary consequences of his act; when the grantor is found to have conveyed for the express purpose of defrauding his creditors, the condition of his estate is immaterial, and only in cases where the actual fraud appears, can the conveyance be sustained on the ground that the grantor retained sufficient property to satisfy his debts. In re STN Enters., Inc., 73 B.R. 470 (Bankr. D. Vt. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case involving an alleged fraudulent conveyance where the transfer of property is for consideration, the creditor must show that the grantor-debtor and the grantee knowingly participated in the fraudulent conveyance. Becker v. Becker, 138 Vt. 372, 416 A.2d 156 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where creditor claimed benefit of this section, and there was no evidence of actual fraudulent purpose, the question was whether on the facts the law would impute fraud to debtor from the condition of his estate and the necessary consequence of his conveyance, regardless of any actual fraudulent intent or purpose on his part, since the law in no case presumes fraud. Becker v. Becker, 138 Vt. 372, 416 A.2d 156 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        In suits to set aside fraudulent conveyances, it is only when there is a valuable consideration for the conveyance that fraud on part of grantee is essential. Corey v. Morrill, 71 Vt. 51, 42 A. 976 (1898).
       </p>
       <p>
        Deed executed in consideration of marriage will not be set aside as to existing creditors, unless it appears that both parties to deed intended by conveyance to delay creditors of grantor. Pierce v. Harrington, 58 Vt. 649, 7 A. 462 (1886).
       </p>
       <p>
        In general, to make conveyance for valuable consideration fraudulent, there must be fraudulent intent both on part of grantor and grantee. Leach v. Francis, 41 Vt. 670 (1869); Prout v. Vaughn, 52 Vt. 451 (1880); Cole v. Cole, 117 Vt. 354, 91 A.2d 819 (1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        If one honestly supposes it necessary for the preservation of his business interests to purchase and does purchase for a full consideration, with no intent to aid the seller in a fraud upon his creditors, the sale will be valid; it will not be valid if the purchaser, with knowledge of the vendor's fraudulent intent, is a mere volunteer in the purchase, and buys the property simply to make a good bargain. Root v. Reynolds, 32 Vt. 139 (1859).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where one not a creditor to the full value of purchased property, purchases for an adequate consideration, and without any intention to defeat or delay any creditors of vendor, his purchase cannot be impeached by such creditors, even if the vendor were at the time threatened with attachments and this was known to the vendee. Lyon v. Rood, 12 Vt. 233 (1840).

         2. Consideration.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Proof of the nature of any consideration passing to debtor is an element of a fraudulent conveyance, and where the conveyance is for consideration the creditor must show that the grantor-debtor and the grantee knowingly participated in the fraudulent conveyance, whereas if the conveyance is without adequate consideration, only proof of grantor's fraud is required. Becker v. Becker, 138 Vt. 372, 416 A.2d 156 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Love and affection cannot be a consideration under the law of fraudulent conveyances. Abbadessa v. Tegu, 122 Vt. 338, 173 A.2d 153 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where debtor gave an order directing payment to claimant of his wages due and to become due, in consideration of an old debt and a further loan and also for the purpose of preventing other creditors trusteeing, to the extent of the indebtedness the contract of assignment was on a legal consideration, but, beyond that, was in contravention of this section and, being thus based upon a consideration illegal in part, the whole contract was void. Dow v. Taylor, 71 Vt. 337, 45 A. 220 (1899).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where services had been rendered to intestate by grantees upon understanding that farm should be conveyed in payment thereof, which services amounted at time of conveyance to more than value of farm, conveyance would not be fraudulent as to creditors. Darling v. Ricker, 68 Vt. 471, 35 A. 376 (1896).
       </p>
       <p>
        Conveyance upon inadequate consideration, or upon no consideration, is not void as to creditors, provided the grantor has remaining property sufficient with which to pay his debts. Wilbur v. Nichols, 61 Vt. 432, 18 A. 154 (1889).
       </p>
       <p>
        Conveyance by debtor of all his attachable property for not more than half its value was void as to existing creditors, and fact that grantee engaged as additional consideration, to support grantor during life, did not render conveyance valid as to creditors. Church v. Chapin, 35 Vt. 223 (1862).
       </p>
       <p>
        Reservation by debtor merely of cash on hand and debts due him from out of state, so that they cannot be attached by trustee process, though amounting in aggregate to sum of his debts, will not render valid a conveyance which, without any reservation of property, would have been invalid as to creditors. Church v. Chapin, 35 Vt. 223 (1862).

       <p>
        This section was not designed to protect, alone, creditors in the strict sense of the term, and the words, "right" and "duty," embrace something more than is covered by the word, "debt." Corey v. Morrill, 71 Vt. 51, 42 A. 976 (1898).
       </p>
       <p>
        Liability upon judgment at law was a "right, debt or duty," within the meaning of this section. Corey v. Morrill, 71 Vt. 51, 42 A. 976 (1898).
       </p>
       <p>
        Wife has tangible and valuable interest in estate of husband, and conveyance made and accepted with intent to defeat this right will be held void as to such right. Nichols v. Nichols, 61 Vt. 426, 18 A. 153 (1889).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that a consideration passed does not validate a deed executed with fraudulent intent to defeat vested right of wife. Nichols v. Nichols, 61 Vt. 426, 18 A. 153 (1889).
       </p>
       <p>
        Claim being founded in tort is not within this section, which relates only to rights and duties arising out of contracts. Green v. Adams, 59 Vt. 602, 10 A. 742 (1887).
       </p>

        A creditor cannot make use of a confession of judgment by his debtor, and a sale of the debtor's property on execution, in accordance with a secret agreement between them, to create a lien merely upon such property to secure the debt, and still permit property after sale to remain in hands of debtor.

        An absolute conveyance of property, with a secret clause of defeasance, written or verbal, is not a conclusive badge of fraud, but such a conveyance is open to suspicion. Smith v. Onion, 19 Vt. 427 (1847).

        A fraudulent conveyance within the meaning of this section is voidable, not void, and is voidable only as to that creditor; the conveyance is valid as between the parties to it and as to the whole world, other than the creditor, and can even bind the creditor if he affirms it.

        If conveyance of land is made to one person, and purchase money is paid by another, a resulting trust is thereby created, and person who has legal title will hold the same for the use and benefit of person paying the money, and if transaction was had with fraudulent intent, property will be held subject to be taken by creditors of person who paid money for the land.

       </p>
       <p>
        This section is subject to case law since the enactment of the English statute from which it was drawn, and one claiming fraud must establish (1) that there existed a right, debt or duty owed to claimant by person accused of fraud, (2) that the defrauder conveyed property which was subject to execution in satisfaction of the debt, (3) the nature of any consideration passing to conveyor, and (4) that the defrauder acted fraudulently to the hindrance of claimant's rights against defrauder.

        Once a creditor shows his debtor made a voluntary conveyance and that the condition of a debtor's estate was such that creditor could not collect on the debt, the law will impute to the debtor fraud in the conveyance, but one seeking to sustain the conveyance may rebut the imputation by evidence showing that at the time of the transfer the debtor had resources sufficient to answer his debts.

        When this section is pleaded, and determination is made whether the debtor has other assets sufficient to answer for his debts, sustaining of the conveyance depending upon whether or not he does, court does not have to exclude out-of-state assets unless it is shown that they are not subject to process in the situs state.

       <p>
        Giving of an absolute deed, without taking back a writing of defeasance, when deed is intended only as security to the grantee is, when grantor is in debt, evidence of fraud, and should be so considered unless it satisfactorily appears that there was some valid reason for transacting the business in that way.

        Joint action against fraudulent grantor and grantee to recover penalty cannot be maintained under this section, and if both are joined as defendants and a verdict is obtained against them, judgment will be arrested. Slack v. Gibbs, 14 Vt. 357 (1842).

         1. Applicability.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where an action on a protested check is between the immediate parties and it is shown that the check was taken by the creditor under an agreement of the parties that it should operate as a memorandum of the amount due from the debtor, this section does not apply. Neverett v. Towne, 123 Vt. 45, 179 A.2d 583 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        An injury under this section is suffered in this State when a check is not paid here. Neverett v. Towne, 121 Vt. 447, 159 A.2d 345 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not apply to instruments whose conditional delivery did not give them the effect and operation of bank checks. Hooper v. Levin, 112 Vt. 321, 24 A.2d 337 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section has no application to postdated checks. Lovell v. Eaton, 99 Vt. 255, 133 A. 742 (1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section is limited to checks, drafts, or orders upon a bank or other depository for payment of money, and applies equally to each named; hence it is immaterial how instrument sued upon is classified so long as it is one covered. J.B. LaCroix & Frere v. Eaton, 99 Vt. 262, 133 A. 745 (1925).

         2. Nature of action.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Action under this section is not in contract, nor an action on check for collection of a debt, but is an action of tort and design of this section is to provide indemnity to holder of an unpaid check falling within its provisions by means of a body action against any person liable under its terms. Neverett v. Towne, 121 Vt. 447, 159 A.2d 345 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        Action under this section is neither common law action for fraud and deceit nor action on check for collection of a debt, but is an action to enforce statutory remedy for benefit of payee or holder of check. Lovell v. Eaton, 99 Vt. 259, 133 A. 744 (1925).

         3. Elements of right of action.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The essential element of the right of action under this section is the knowledge on the part of the maker that at the time of issuing a check he does not have sufficient funds on deposit in the institution upon which the check is drawn to pay it. Neverett v. Towne, 123 Vt. 45, 179 A.2d 583 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section created a remedy for benefit of holder of presently dated check, and was designed to provide indemnity to him by means of body action against maker of unpaid check falling within its provisions; hence, no injury or damage beyond non-payment need be shown. North Adams Beef & Produce Co. v. Cantor, 103 Vt. 514, 156 A. 879 (1931).
       </p>
       <p>
        Neither fraud nor deceit is an essential element of right of action under this section. Lovell v. Eaton, 99 Vt. 259, 133 A. 744 (1925); North Adams Beef & Produce Co. v. Cantor, 103 Vt. 514, 156 A. 879 (1931).

         4. Effect of payee's knowledge of lack of funds.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Since fraud and deceit are not essential elements of a right of action under this section, it is no defense to the action that the payee had knowledge of such lack of funds at the time of taking the check from the maker. Neverett v. Towne, 123 Vt. 45, 179 A.2d 583 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section applies to presently dated check, although payee was informed at time of delivery that there were no funds to meet check. North Adams Beef & Produce Co. v. Cantor, 103 Vt. 514, 156 A. 879 (1931).

    </h5>
    <p>
     There was sufficient evidence to support a judgment in favor of plaintiffs in a suit under the Consumer Protection Act based on a misrepresentation or omission of material fact, as a fact-finder could reasonably infer that defendant agreed to the sale of a demonstrator modular home while harboring an unstated intention not to consummate it, but rather to persuade plaintiffs later to take a different, newly manufactured model. McKinstry v. Fecteau Residential Homes, 200 Vt. 392, 131 A.3d 1123 (2015).
    </p>
    <p>
     In an action under the Consumer Protection Act, the trial court did not err in awarding an attorney's fee less than sought by plaintiffs, as it considered the result obtained by plaintiffs versus the recovery they sought, and did not err in finding that plaintiffs had not shown a pattern of socially irresponsible behavior on the part of defendant. McKinstry v. Fecteau Residential Homes, 200 Vt. 392, 131 A.3d 1123 (2015).
    </p>
    <p>
     Trial court erred by offsetting the deposit refunded by defendant against the attorney's fees awarded to plaintiffs, as the return of the deposit had nothing to do with plaintiffs' claim that defendant violated the Consumer Protection Act. McKinstry v. Fecteau Residential Homes, 200 Vt. 392, 131 A.3d 1123 (2015).

        As to homeowners' Consumer Fraud Act claim, the trial court made precise findings concerning the parties' knowledge of a defective carpet, its location, and the carpet company's willingness to replace it. There was no reason to disturb the trial court's determination that the company made no misleading statements to the homeowners regarding the carpeting. First Quality Carpets, Inc. v. Kirschbaum, 191 Vt. 28, 54 A.3d 465 (2012).

        Car buyer satisfied the elements for a claim under the Vermont Consumer Fraud Act. The dealer represented that the title was clear and erroneously certified an odometer reading; the buyer reasonably relied on the misrepresentations since nothing suggested he had reason to question the car's title or the odometer's accuracy; and the misrepresentations were material as they were closely linked to the vehicle's longevity and value.

        "In commerce" requirement narrows the Vermont Consumer Fraud Act's application to prohibit only unfair or deceptive acts or practices that occur in the consumer marketplace. To be considered "in commerce," the transaction must take place in the context of an ongoing business in which the defendant holds himself out to the public; further, the practice must have a potential harmful effect on the consuming public, and thus constitute a breach of a duty owed to consumers in general. Foti Fuels, Inc. v. Kurrle Corp., 195 Vt. 524, 90 A.3d 885 (2013).

        Transactions resulting not from the conduct of any trade or business but rather from private negotiations between two individual parties who have countervailing rights and liabilities established under common law principles of contract, tort, and property law remain beyond the purview of the Vermont Consumer Fraud Act.

        Although certain representations may give rise to a malpractice claim, they are generally not actionable under the Consumer Fraud Act if they are the product of the defendant's professional judgment based upon his legal knowledge and skill. Moreover, for purposes of this rule, there is no meaningful distinction between lawyers and other professionals hired to give a specialized or expert interpretation of a matter. Webb v.

        In a consumer fraud action, where the sellers of property knew about an underground gasoline spill, knew that there was ongoing monitoring of the well on the property in connection with the spill, and failed to disclose these facts to plaintiff buyers, the omission was objectively and plainly material; thus, plaintiffs were entitled to judgment in their favor.

        In regard to plaintiff's claim under Vermont's Consumer Fraud Act, to survive summary judgment, plaintiff was required to demonstrate: (1) that defendant made a representation or omission that was likely to mislead; (2) that plaintiff interpreted the message reasonably under the circumstances; and (3) that the misleading effects were material.

        Under the Consumer Fraud Act, complainant must establish proof of three elements: (1) the representation or omission at issue was likely to mislead consumers; (2) the consumer's interpretation of the representation was reasonable under the circumstances; and (3) the misleading representation was material in that it affected the consumer's purchasing decision.

       <p>
        Under the Consumer Fraud Act, a consumer establishes the element that the representation or omission at issue was likely to mislead if she proves that it had the tendency or capacity to deceive a reasonable consumer; messages susceptible to multiple reasonable interpretations may violate the Act if just one of those interpretations is false and, notably, no intent to deceive or mislead need be proven because the statute requires only proof of an intent to publish.

        Deception under this section is measured by an objective standard focusing on risk of consumer harm in a particular case; actual injury need not be shown, because representations made with the capacity or tendency to deceive satisfy the standard.

        Given the lack of clarity as to what transpired, summary judgment was inappropriate in a suit under the Consumer Fraud Act brought by truck buyers. The evidentiary record did not make it clear how a "mistake" in a bank's giving the truck dealership the wrong payoff amount occurred or even whether there was a mistake; further, the principal facts that the trial court apparently relied on in ruling in favor of the dealership - that the truck buyers knew they had substantial negative equity in their vehicle and that another dealership had recently declined to negotiate with them because of the substantial negative equity in the vehicle - did not necessarily undercut the buyers' allegation that the dealer made, even if good-faith, false and misleading representations actionable under the Act by telling them that their lien holder would not seek over-mileage payments on their trade-in.

        While defendant's marketing brochure advertised its flooring as a "spectacular, lifelike wood," and natural wood floors did not develop blue-green spots all over them, as did the flooring here, this alone was not sufficient to demonstrate that the marketing brochure would mislead a reasonable consumer.

        Real estate sellers' Consumer Fraud Act claim failed because they failed to show that any alleged "misrepresentation" was material to the reasonable consumer or that there was any damage or injury attributable to the representation that a real estate commission would be split equally. There was no evidence that a reasonable seller of a small business would conclude that the greater incentive for the buyer broker was more important than a greater incentive for a seller broker or that the commission split affected the price for which the business was sold.

        Real estate sellers' Consumer Fraud Act claim failed when the parties' listing agreement stated that the broker "recommended" mediation.

        In cases where tenants are basing a Consumer Protection Act (CPA) claim upon the failure of landlords to disclose code violations related to the habitability of residential premises, the tenants must show that the landlords knew or should have known of the alleged defect in the premises. Nothing in the CPA evinces a legislative intent to make landlords strictly liable under the act for having failed to reveal every potential latent defect in residential premises; moreover, requiring knowledge on the part of landlords for their failures to disclose defects or code violations in residential housing is more consistent with the actual notice requirement of the Residential Rental Agreements Act's habitability provision, which often forms the basis for claims under the CPA.

        Landlords may be held liable under the Consumer Protection Act for not revealing material defects or code violations of which they should have been aware; they may not avoid liability by intentionally remaining ignorant of information that they have a duty to disclose, particularly if they fail to inform tenants of the limits of their knowledge with respect to that information. Tenants can establish through circumstantial evidence alone that landlords knew or should have known of a code violation or other defect impacting habitability. Terry v.

        Where the assignor of promissory notes held by plaintiffs and executed by defendants during home solicitation sales never furnished defendants with notices of their right to cancel the credit transactions, defendants' notices of rescission, given at the time of the institution of the action to enforce the notes, were timely.

        The term "probable cause to believe," in subsec.

        The plain meaning of "other violator" in the civil penalty provision of the Consumer Fraud Act (CFA) is anyone engaged in an unfair or deceptive commercial practice in violation of the CFA's prohibition on such activity.

        There was no basis for categorically excluding landlords from the range of potential defendants under the Consumer Fraud Act (CFA), given the court's conclusion that there was evidence that landlords had engaged in unfair and deceptive commercial practices.

        Sheriff's office lacked constitutional standing to assert a predatory pricing claim against a police department in part because it had no legally protected right to "fair competition" with other statutorily created government entities to provide police services to a town. The town was under no obligation to entertain bids for police services in the first instance, or to award the contract to the lowest bidder. Franklin County Sheriff's Office v. St. Albans City Police Dep't, 192 Vt. 188, 58 A.3d 207 (2012).

        Sheriff's office lacked constitutional standing to assert a predatory pricing claim against a police department that bid to provide police services to a town, as no commerce existed so as to provide the sheriff's office with a legally protected interest. The provision of police services in Vermont occurred outside the realm of commerce because it involved no interchange of goods or commodities on the open market; it was a governmental function provided only by governmental entities for the benefit of the public. Franklin County Sheriff's Office v. St. Albans City Police Dep't, 192 Vt. 188, 58 A.3d 207 (2012).

        Sheriff's office lacked prudential standing to assert a predatory pricing claim against a police department that bid to provide police services to a town, as its alleged injuries did not fall within the zone of interests to be protected by the predatory pricing statute. The "competitors" were all statutorily created entities, meaning that one entity could not lower its prices so as to put another out of business, nor could potential entrants be deterred from entering the "market" because the statutory scheme allowed no new entrants. Franklin County Sheriff's Office v. St. Albans City Police Dep't, 192 Vt. 188, 58 A.3d 207 (2012).

       </h5>
       <p>
        There is simply no unrestrained interaction of competitive forces in the Vermont law enforcement market that would require regulation by the predatory pricing statute. It is the protection of competition, rather than the protection of competitors, that antitrust laws are designed to protect, and the statutory scheme relating to law enforcement embraces no element of competition in an open marketplace: this is because the universe of entities that can provide police services is narrowly limited to State actors, and the "market" in which the services are contracted for is wholly restricted. Franklin County Sheriff's Office v. St. Albans City Police Dep't, 192 Vt. 188, 58 A.3d 207 (2012).

The court may issue an award for the person's actual damages or $500.00 for a first violation, or $1,000.00 for each subsequent violation, whichever is greater. In considering the amount of punitive damages, the court may consider, among other relevant factors, the extent to which a telephone solicitor maintained and complied with procedures designed to ensure compliance with the requirements of sections 2464a and 2464b of this title. This section shall not limit any other claims the person may have under applicable law.

    <p>
     "(1) Lead is highly toxic to humans, particularly to young children.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) Ingesting lead can cause irreversible damage that results in long-lasting, permanent neurological damage, such as a decrease in I.Q.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(3) The effects of lead exposure are cumulative, and a child may be harmed by ingesting very small amounts of lead.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(4) Over the years there have been public reports of lead in certain food products, including fruit juices, honey, candy, chocolate, and eggs.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(5) The current statutory definition of 'children's products' includes food, vitamins, and supplements.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(6) Although there is no single governmental limit on lead in food, such limits as do exist are much lower than the 100 parts per million (ppm) limit on lead in 'children's products' under Vermont law. For example, the federal Food and Drug Administration has set a 0.005 ppm limit on lead in bottled water and has recommended a 0.1 ppm limit on lead in candy."

       An "add-on discount membership program" is a program that entitles consumers to receive discounts, rebates, rewards, or similar incentives on the purchase of goods or services or both, sold to a consumer during the purchase of a different good or service using the same billing information.

       "Billing information" means any data that enables a seller of an add-on discount membership program to access a consumer's credit or debit card, bank, or other account, but does not include the consumer's name, e-mail address, telephone number, or mailing address. For credit card and debit card accounts, billing information includes the full account number, card type, and expiration date and, if necessary, the security code. For accounts at a financial institution, "billing information" includes the full account number and routing number and, if necessary, the name of the financial institution holding the account.

      "NOTICE TO VERMONT CONSUMERS
     </p>
     <p>
      Vermont Consumers
     </p>
     <p>
      Have the Right to Obtain a Security Freeze
     </p>
     <p>
      You have a right to place a "security freeze" on your credit report pursuant to <cite class="vt-code">9 V.S.A. ยง 2480h</cite> at no charge. The security freeze will prohibit a credit reporting agency from releasing any information in your credit report without your express authorization. A security freeze must be requested in writing by certified mail.
     </p>
     <p>
      The security freeze is designed to help prevent credit, loans, and services from being approved in your name without your consent. However, you should be aware that using a security freeze to take control over who gains access to the personal and financial information in your credit report may delay, interfere with, or prohibit the timely approval of any subsequent request or application you make regarding new loans, credit, mortgage, insurance, government services or payments, rental housing, employment, investment, license, cellular phone, utilities, digital signature, Internet credit card transaction, or other services, including an extension of credit at point of sale.
     </p>
     <p>
      When you place a security freeze on your credit report, within ten business days you will be provided a personal identification number, password, or other equally or more secure method of authentication to use if you choose to remove the freeze on your credit report or authorize the release of your credit report for a specific party, parties, or period of time after the freeze is in place. To provide that authorization, you must contact the credit reporting agency and provide all of the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      (1) The unique personal identification number, password, or other method of authentication provided by the credit reporting agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      (2) Proper identification to verify your identity.
     </p>
     <p>
      (3) The proper information regarding the third party or parties who are to receive the credit report or the period of time for which the report shall be available to users of the credit report.
     </p>
     <p>
      A credit reporting agency may not charge a fee to remove the freeze on your credit report or authorize the release of your credit report for a specific party, parties, or period of time after the freeze is in place.
     </p>
     <p>
      A credit reporting agency that receives a request from a consumer to lift temporarily a freeze on a credit report shall comply with the request no later than three business days after receiving the request.
     </p>
     <p>
      A security freeze will not apply to "preauthorized approvals of credit." If you want to stop receiving preauthorized approvals of credit, you should call [INSERT PHONE NUMBERS] [ALSO INSERT ALL OTHER CONTACT INFORMATION FOR PRESCREENED OFFER OPT-OUT.]
     </p>
     <p>
      A security freeze does not apply to a person or entity, or its affiliates, or collection agencies acting on behalf of the person or entity with which you have an existing account that requests information in your credit report for the purposes of reviewing or collecting the account, provided you have previously given your consent to this use of your credit reports. Reviewing the account includes activities related to account maintenance, monitoring, credit line increases, and account upgrades and enhancements.
     </p>
     <p>
      You have a right to bring a civil action against someone who violates your rights under the credit reporting laws. The action can be brought against a credit reporting agency or a user of your credit report."

      Structured settlement agreements, which provide for payments to a person over a period of time, are often used in the settlement of actions such as personal injury or medical claims and serve a number of valid purposes, including protection of persons from economic victimization and ensuring a person's ability to provide for his or her future needs and obligations. It is the policy of this State that such agreements, which have often been approved by a court, should not be set aside lightly or without good reason.

        Vermont's statute requires the trial court to issue express findings of fact based on admissible evidence directed at each factor in the provision governing approval of transfers of structured settlement payment rights; through consideration of each factor, no one of which should weigh more heavily than any other, the court determines whether a proposed transfer is in a payee's best interest. Because the trial court did not make express findings of fact on all factors based on admissible evidence, remand was required. Stevens Law Office v. Symetra, 205 Vt. 136, 172 A.3d 793 (2017).

The Attorney General may enforce the performance of the requirements of subsection (c) of this section by sending a letter by certified mail, return receipt requested, demanding that the charitable organization comply with the requirements of subsection (c) of this section. A charitable organization that fails to comply with subsection (c) of this section shall be subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $1,000.00 for each noncomplying agreement, up to a maximum total penalty of $10,000.00.

        A trademark consisting of an eagle with wings thereon and the words "Nationwide" in block type for use on insurance policies, letterheads, printed advertisements, and other written material concerned primarily with insurance was not registerable since it would not be used to designate goods, wares, or merchandise. 1954-56 Op.

        A name or design that was to be used for the identification of a service to be rendered to a subscriber to an insurance plan was not within the contemplation of this section authorizing registration of tradenames to designate goods, wares, or merchandise. 1946-48 Op. Atty. Gen. 268.

      Commodities in liquid form shall be sold only by liquid measure or by weight, and, except as otherwise provided in this chapter, commodities not in liquid form shall be sold only by weight, by measure of length or area, or by count. However, liquid commodities may be sold by weight and commodities not in liquid form may be sold by count only if such methods give accurate information as to the quantity of commodity sold. The provisions of this section shall not apply (1) to commodities when sold for immediate consumption on the premises where sold, (2) to vegetables when sold by the head or bunch, (3) to commodities in containers standardized by a law of this State or by federal law, (4) to commodities in package form when there exists a general consumer usage to express the quantity in some other manner, (5) to concrete aggregates, concrete mixtures, and loose solid materials such as earth, soil, gravel, crushed stone, and the like, when sold by cubic measure, or (6) to unprocessed vegetable and animal fertilizer when sold by cubic measure. The Secretary may issue such reasonable regulations as are necessary to ensure that amounts of commodity sold are determined in accordance with good commercial practice and are so determined and represented as to be accurate and informative to all parties at interest.

       <br/>
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In bargains for or purchase of saw logs or round timber by measure, the number of feet shall be ascertained either by the international log rule as designed by the U.S. Forestry Service for a one-quarter inch kerf or by the Vermont rule as follows: multiply the average diameter of the top of the log, inside the bark, in inches, by half such diameter in inches, disregarding fractions of an inch less than a half, and regarding fractions greater than a half as a full inch, and the number obtained as the product will represent the contents in feet of a log of that diameter 12 feet long. If the log is less than 12 feet long, the actual contents will be the same fraction of the above product as the actual length of the log is of 12 feet.
    If the log is more than 12 feet long, commence at the upper end and measure it into sections of 12 feet; then, according to the above rule, find the contents of each section and fractional section.
    The aggregate of the contents of the sections will be the contents of the whole log, and shall be marked on the small end as to its contents.

      The General Assembly finds that:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t09p04c74s2792ol11">
       Efficiency standards for certain products sold or installed in the State assure consumers and businesses that those products meet minimum efficiency performance levels, thus saving money on utility bills.
      </li>
      <li id="t09p04c74s2792ol12">
       These efficiency standards save energy and thus reduce pollution and other environmental impacts associated with the production, distribution, and use of electricity, natural gas, and oil.
      </li>
      <li id="t09p04c74s2792ol13">
       These efficiency standards can make electricity systems more reliable by reducing the strain on the electricity grid during peak demand periods. Furthermore, improved energy efficiency can reduce or delay the need for new power plants, power transmission lines, and power distribution system upgrades.
      </li>
      <li id="t09p04c74s2792ol14">
       Energy efficiency standards contribute to the economy of this State by helping to balance better energy supply and demand, thus reducing pressure for higher natural gas and electricity prices. By saving consumers and businesses money on energy bills, efficiency standards help the State and local economy since energy bill savings can be spent on local goods and services.

     ยง
    
    1, effective July 1, 2016, provides: "The General Assembly finds and declares that:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(1) Federal law does not provide for the labeling of food that is produced with genetic engineering, as evidenced by the following:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(A) Federal labeling and food and drug laws do not require manufacturers of food produced with genetic engineering to label such food as genetically engineered.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(B) As indicated by the testimony of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Supervisory Consumer Safety Officer, the FDA has statutory authority to require labeling of food products, but does not consider genetically engineered foods to be materially different from their traditional counterparts to require such labeling.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(C) No formal FDA policy on the labeling of genetically engineered foods has been adopted. Currently, the FDA only provides nonbinding guidance on the labeling of genetically engineered foods, including a 1992 draft guidance regarding labeling of food produced from genetic engineering and a 2001 draft guidance for industry regarding voluntary labeling of food produced from genetic engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) Federal law does not require independent testing of the safety of food produced with genetic engineering, as evidenced by the following:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(A) In its regulation of food, the FDA does not distinguish genetically engineered foods from foods developed by traditional plant breeding.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(B) Under its regulatory framework, the FDA does not independently test the safety of genetically engineered foods. Instead, manufacturers submit safety research and studies, the majority of which the manufacturers finance or conduct. The FDA reviews the manufacturers' research and reports through a voluntary safety consultation, and issues a letter to the manufacturer acknowledging the manufacturer's conclusion regarding the safety of the genetically engineered food product being tested.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(C) The FDA does not use meta-studies or other forms of statistical analysis to verify that the studies it reviews are not biased by financial or professional conflicts of interest.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(D) There is a lack of consensus regarding the validity of the research and science surrounding the safety of genetically engineered foods, as indicated by the fact that there are peer-reviewed studies published in international scientific literature showing negative, neutral, and positive health results.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(E) There have been no long-term or epidemiologic studies in the United States that examine the safety of human consumption of genetically engineered foods.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(F) Independent scientists may be limited from conducting safety and risk-assessment research of genetically engineered materials used in food products due to industry restrictions or patent restrictions on the use for research of those genetically engineered materials used in food products.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(3) Genetically engineered foods are increasingly available for human consumption, as evidenced by the fact that:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(A) it is estimated that up to 80 percent of the processed foods sold in the United States are at least partially produced from genetic engineering; and
    </p>
    <p>
     "(B) according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, in 2012, genetically engineered soybeans accounted for 93 percent of U.S. soybean acreage, and genetically engineered corn accounted for 88 percent of U.S. corn acreage.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(4) Genetically engineered foods potentially pose risks to health, safety, agriculture, and the environment, as evidenced by the following:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(A) There are conflicting studies assessing the health consequences of food produced from genetic engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(B) The genetic engineering of plants and animals may cause unintended consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(C) The use of genetically engineered crops is increasing in commodity agricultural production practices, which contribute to genetic homogeneity, loss of biodiversity, and increased vulnerability of crops to pests, diseases, and variable climate conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(D) Cross-pollination of or cross-contamination by genetically engineered crops may contaminate organic crops and, consequently, affect marketability of those crops.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(E) Cross-pollination from genetically engineered crops may have an adverse effect on native flora and fauna. The transfer of unnatural deoxyribonucleic acid to wild relatives can lead to displacement of those native plants, and in turn, displacement of the native fauna dependent on those wild varieties.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(5) For multiple health, personal, religious, and environmental reasons, the State of Vermont finds that food produced from genetic engineering should be labeled as such, as evidenced by the following:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(A) Public opinion polls conducted by the Center for Rural Studies at the University of Vermont indicate that a large majority of Vermonters want foods produced with genetic engineering to be labeled as such.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(B) Polling by the New York Times indicated that many consumers are under an incorrect assumption about whether the food they purchase is produced from genetic engineering, and labeling food as produced from genetic engineering will reduce consumer confusion or deception regarding the food they purchase.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(C) Because genetic engineering, as regulated by this act, involves the direct injection of genes into cells, the fusion of cells, or the hybridization of genes that does not occur in nature, labeling foods produced with genetic engineering as 'natural,' 'naturally made,' 'naturally grown,' 'all natural,' or other similar descriptors is inherently misleading, poses a risk of confusing or deceiving consumers, and conflicts with the general perception that 'natural' foods are not genetically engineered.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(D) Persons with certain religious beliefs object to producing foods using genetic engineering because of objections to tampering with the genetic makeup of life forms and the rapid introduction and proliferation of genetically engineered organisms and, therefore, need food to be labeled as genetically engineered in order to conform to religious beliefs and comply with dietary restrictions.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(E) Labeling gives consumers information they can use to make decisions about what products they would prefer to purchase.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(6) Because both the FDA and the U.S. Congress do not require the labeling of food produced with genetic engineering, the State should require food produced with genetic engineering to be labeled as such in order to serve the interests of the State, notwithstanding limited exceptions, to prevent inadvertent consumer deception, prevent potential risks to human health, protect religious practices, and protect the environment."

       Public health and food safety.
    
    Establish a system by which persons may make informed decisions regarding the potential health effects of the food they purchase and consume and by which, if they choose, persons may avoid potential health risks of food produced from genetic engineering.
      </li>
      <li id="t09p04c82As3041ol12">
       Environmental impacts.
    
    Inform the purchasing decisions of consumers who are concerned about the potential environmental effects of the production of food from genetic engineering.
      </li>
      <li id="t09p04c82As3041ol13">
       Consumer confusion and deception.
    
    Reduce and prevent consumer confusion and deception by prohibiting the labeling of products produced from genetic engineering as "natural" and by promoting the disclosure of factual information on food labels to allow consumers to make informed decisions.

       <p>
        Plaintiffs' Commerce Clause claim challenging Vermont's law regulating signage and advertising of food produced through genetic engineering (GE food) stated plausible per se violation of Commerce Clause in regulating such communications regardless of where they take place; however, remaining Commerce Clause claims challenging the law's labeling requirements were subject to dismissal because the law does not require manufacturers to alter their labeling, production, and distribution practices nationwide and is indifferent regarding whether and how GE food is labeled in other states. Grocery Mfrs. Ass'n v. Sorrell, 102 Supp. 3d 583 (D. Vt. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont's law regulating labeling and advertising of GE food was neither express nor conflict preempted by Food, Drug & Cosmetic Act or Nutrition Labeling and Education Act given the lack of any clear congressional intent to preempt, but there was express preemption under Federal Meat Inspection Act and Poultry Products Inspection Act for meat and poultry products; however, these were primarily exempt under the law and plaintiffs' failure to produce evidence that its members actually manufactured non-exempt products subject to these federal statutes rendered them not likely to succeed on merits. Grocery Mfrs. Ass'n v. Sorrell, 102 Supp. 3d 583 (D. Vt. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Preliminary injunction on plaintiffs' First Amendment claim that Vermont law requiring labeling of GE food was denied, as State had established that the labeling requirement was reasonably related to the State's substantial interests; higher scrutiny (intermediate or strict) was not warranted. Grocery Mfrs. Ass'n v. Sorrell, 102 Supp. 3d 583 (D. Vt. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiffs were likely to prevail on the merits of their First Amendment challenge to Vermont law's ban on the use of "natural" terminology in advertising, labeling, and signage for GE food because State failed to establish that restriction directly advanced substantial State interest and was no greater than necessary to serve that interest; however, preliminary injunction was not warranted due to plaintiffs' failure to show irreparable harm. Grocery Mfrs. Ass'n v. Sorrell, 102 Supp. 3d 583 (D. Vt. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiffs were likely to prevail on the merits of their First Amendment and Due Process claims that Vermont law's ban on use of "natural" terminology in advertising, labeling, and signage for GE food is void for vagueness with respect to its restriction on use of "any words of similar import" because that phrase fails to provide fair notice of what is prohibited; however, preliminary injunction was not warranted due to plaintiffs' failure to show irreparable harm. Grocery Mfrs. Ass'n v. Sorrell, 102 Supp. 3d 583 (D. Vt. 2015).

     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     The classification for legislative purposes of a person, firm, or corporation engaged in the business of outdoor advertising for direct profit through rental or compensation in a class apart from one engaged in advertising, not for such direct profit but for the purpose of fostering a local business, a community enterprise, or public safety, is clearly not unconstitutional.

      2. Nature of regulation.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     Ostensibly located on private property, the real and sole value of a billboard is its proximity to public thoroughfares; thus the regulation of billboards and their restriction is not so much a regulation of private property as it is a regulation of the use of streets and other public thoroughfares. Kelbro, Inc. v. Myrick, 113 Vt. 64, 30 A.2d 527 (1943).

     <p>
      At the time of making a loan, a pawnbroker shall deliver to the person pawning or pledging any goods, articles, or things a memorandum or note signed by him or her containing the substance of the entry required to be made in his or her book by section 3865 of this title, and a charge shall not be made or received by the pawnbroker for such entry, memorandum, or note. The holder of such memorandum or note shall be presumed to be the person entitled to redeem the pledge, and the pawnbroker shall deliver such article to the person so presenting such memorandum or note on payment of principal and interest. Should such ticket be lost or mislaid, the pawnor shall at once apply to the pawnbroker describing the article pawned, in which case it shall be the duty of the pawnbroker to permit such person to examine his or her books, and, on finding the entry for such ticket, note, or memorandum so lost, the pawnbroker shall issue a second or stop ticket for the same. In case such pawnor neglects so to apply and examine such books and receive such memorandum or note in the manner provided in this section, the pawnbroker shall deliver the pledge to any person producing such original ticket for the redemption thereof. This section shall not be so construed as to limit or affect such pawnbroker's common law liability in cases where goods are stolen or other legal defects of title in the pledgor exist.

     Where a construction contract was entered into on a date prior to the effective date of this chapter, and modified by the addendum agreement on a date subsequent to that date, because of the principle that "[t]he modification of a contract results in the establishment of a new agreement between the parties which pro tanto supplants the affected provisions of the original agreement while leaving the balance of it intact," the addendum provision was not itself a stand-alone agreement, and plaintiff's argument for application of this chapter failed.

        There was no merit to a developer's argument that a jury verdict for a contractor on the contractor's counterclaim under the Prompt Payment Act was unsupported by the evidence. For each witness whose testimony the developer cited, there was contrary testimony from a witness for the contractor; the jury simply chose to credit the testimony favoring the contractor rather than that favoring the developer.

        Prompt Pay Act plainly does not condition its application upon a contractor submitting monthly invoices; the plain meaning of the statutory language is that the contractor is entitled to submit progress invoices monthly, in the absence of an agreement otherwise, but is not required to do so. A plaintiff is not denied the protection of the Act because it did not bill monthly. Reed v. Zurn, 187 Vt. 613, 992 A.2d 1061 (mem.) (2010).

        Good-faith-claim defense applies to a penalty authorized by the section of the Prompt Pay Act dealing with disputes and penalties and is nowhere reflected in the section dealing with an owner's payment obligations. Thus, prejudgment interest was available to a contractor despite the presence of a developer's unliquidated claim for the contractor's taking of sand from the job site. Birchwood Land Co. v. Ormond Bushey & Sons, Inc., 194 Vt. 478, 82 A.3d 539 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        "Except as otherwise agreed" language in the section of the Prompt Pay Act concerning an owner's payment obligations gives effect to an agreement by the parties about prejudgment interest rather than an agreement about the right of the developer to withhold payment of an invoice; similarly, the due date language refers to the times for payment set out in the statute and not to the right of a developer to withhold a payment over a dispute with a contractor. In light of this construction, the trial court properly ruled that a contractor was entitled to prejudgment interest on its net judgment when a developer withheld payment for the loss of its sand. Birchwood Land Co. v. Ormond Bushey & Sons, Inc., 194 Vt. 478, 82 A.3d 539 (2013).

        In action arising out of the construction of a modular home by plaintiff contractor for defendant homeowner, the court did not abuse its discretion when it declined to apply the interest rate contained in the contract's "late fee" provision because the homeowner had a good faith basis for withholding the outstanding balance, and, after concluding it was not bound by the contractual interest rate, the court correctly applied the statutory 12% interest rate found throughout statute pertaining to construction contracts.

        4002(d) and 4007(b) was denied where there was a dispute at trial over the amount, if any, the creditor was due, the waste company called into question the propriety of the creditor's lost profit, and it was unclear whether the jury compensated the creditor on its quantum meruit and breach of contract awards; thus, the jury award did not represent amounts readily ascertainable at the time of the default and prejudgment interest was not due the creditor as of right.

        When a general contractor communicated to a subcontractor that a check was a "payment in full" on the contract, and there was a dispute regarding the amount the general contractor owed to the subcontractor, the subcontractor's cashing the check could be construed as an accord and satisfaction on the contract. The subcontractor could not cash the check until the general contractor acknowledged that the subcontractor could still pursue its claims; therefore, the general contractor wrongfully withheld the retainage check in violation of the Prompt Pay Act.

         1. Attorney's fees.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        $234,320 fee award under the Prompt Pay Act was reasonable, as an award of attorneys' fees in excess of the judgment amount was not per se unreasonable and the trial court found that the specialized legal skills of both defense counsel, who specialized in construction law, were of importance and that the paper-intensive nature of the case made it preferable to have two attorneys. Construction Drilling, Inc. v. Engineers Construction,
    Inc., - Vt.
    - , 236 A.3d 193 (May 29, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Contractor's status as the net victor - both in terms of number of claims and monetary award - did not compel a conclusion that it substantially prevailed under the Prompt Pay Act for purposes of recovering attorney's fees. The trial court acted within its discretion to consider the contractor's position in determining whether it substantially prevailed. Birchwood Land Co. v. Ormond Bushey & Sons, Inc., 194 Vt. 478, 82 A.3d 539 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff brought an action for partition and her father brought a claim under the Prompt Pay Act for time and labor he contributed to the building project, it was error to deny defendant legal fees associated with the father's claim, on which defendant prevailed. Although the personal and emotional alignment of plaintiff and her father was obvious, their legal interests were not so overlapping as to warrant treating them as the same party. Nystrom v. Hafford, 192 Vt. 300, 59 A.3d 736 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont Supreme Court does not mean to suggest that in a typical construction dispute, trial courts must parse Prompt Pay Act (PPA) and non-PPA claims in identifying the substantially prevailing party in connection with the PPA claim, or in calculating a fee award. A fee award should not be apportioned among claims that arise from a common core of facts; however, as a threshold matter, trial courts must consider and determine which claims do, in fact, arise from a common core of facts insofar as the evidence relevant to those claims is the same. Nystrom v. Hafford, 192 Vt. 300, 59 A.3d 736 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in finding that neither homeowners nor a contractor were a substantially prevailing party for purposes of an attorney fee award under the Prompt Payment Act with respect to their construction contract dispute. Trombly Plumbing & Heating v. Quinn, 190 Vt. 552, 25 A.3d 565 (mem.) (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a homeowner recovered a net judgment of $566 against a contractor, the trial court did not err in finding that the contractor was the substantially prevailing party. The contractor not only prevailed on its own counterclaim, but also successfully defended against the bulk of the homeowner's claims. Burton v. Jeremiah Beach Parker Restoration & Construction Management Corp., 188 Vt. 583, 6 A.3d 38 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        In awarding a contractor attorney's fees after the contractor succeeded on its counterclaim and successfully defended against most of a homeowner's claims, the trial court did not err in awarding fees incurred in defending the claims that the contractor ultimately lost. The homeowner had cited no authority to suggest that the trial court had to break down the winning and losing claims in determining the reasonableness of the fee award. Burton v. Jeremiah Beach Parker Restoration & Construction Management Corp., 188 Vt. 583, 6 A.3d 38 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in awarding a contractor attorney's fees for both defending against a developer's claims and for the contractor's counterclaim under the Prompt Payment Act. The central issues contested at trial were common to the claims and the counterclaims, and the same evidence was central to resolving both the claims and the counterclaims. B & F Land Development, LLC v. Steinfeld, 184 Vt. 624, 966 A.2d 127 (mem.) (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff submitted a motion for attorney's fees to the court following the jury's verdict, and, following this request, the court made no findings concerning whether plaintiff was entitled to fees under a contract as the "prevailing party," or whether it was entitled to fees pursuant to statute as the "substantially prevailing party," thus, without any findings or conclusions to support its decision, the court erred in denying fees. EBWS, LLC v. Britly Corp., 181 Vt. 513, 928 A.2d 497 (May 25, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in refusing to invoke the "late fee" provision of a construction contract concerning attorney's fees because the homeowner had a good faith basis for withholding payment of the outstanding balance: first, because the contractor breached the contract by failing to complete the installation of the home in a workmanlike manner and, second, because, prior to the time the home became ready for occupancy, an unpaid subcontractor filed an action and a mechanic's lien against the homeowner. Fletcher Hill, Inc. v. Crosbie, 178 Vt. 77, 872 A.2d 292 (January 14, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the mandatory language of this section requires an award of attorney's fees to a substantially prevailing party, the question of whether any party to a lawsuit substantially prevailed is left to the trial court's discretion. Fletcher Hill, Inc. v. Crosbie, 178 Vt. 77, 872 A.2d 292 (January 14, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the jury verdict resulted in awards to both parties, the trial court correctly declined to award attorney's fees under this section because neither the language of the statute nor case law dictates that determining whether a party substantially prevailed turns on a simple mathematical comparison of the parties' respective recoveries: first, although the statute accords no discretion to the court to deny fees where it applies, determining where it applies-or identifying the substantially prevailing party-falls within the trial court's discretion, and does not flow automatically from the calculation of the net victor and, furthermore, the use of the words "the substantially prevailing party," does not imply that there must be a substantially prevailing party in every case. Fletcher Hill, Inc. v. Crosbie, 178 Vt. 77, 872 A.2d 292 (January 14, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court correctly awarded attorney fees to defendant because it was clear that it was the "substantially prevailing party" in a "proceeding to recover any payment" due under a construction contract. DJ Painting, Inc. v. Baraw Enterprises, Inc., 172 Vt. 239, 776 A.2d 413 (2001).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Good-faith-claim defense applies to a penalty authorized by the section of the Prompt Pay Act dealing with disputes and penalties and is nowhere reflected in the section dealing with an owner's payment obligations. Thus, prejudgment interest was available to a contractor despite the presence of a developer's unliquidated claim for the contractor's taking of sand from the job site. Birchwood Land Co. v. Ormond Bushey & Sons, Inc., 194 Vt. 478, 82 A.3d 539 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in awarding a contractor prejudgment interest on his counterclaim against a developer under the Prompt Payment Act. The jury found for the contractor in the amount requested in his counterclaim, which was the amount the developer had refused to pay. B & F Land Development, LLC v. Steinfeld, 184 Vt. 624, 966 A.2d 127 (mem.) (2008).

        4002(d) and 4007(b) was denied where there was a dispute at trial over the amount, if any, the creditor was due, the waste company called into question the propriety of the creditor's lost profit, and it was unclear whether the jury compensated the creditor on its quantum meruit and breach of contract awards; thus, the jury award did not represent amounts readily ascertainable at the time of the default and prejudgment interest was not due the creditor as of right.

       <p>
        Because all of the claims between a general contractor and a subcontractor arose out of the same factual situation, in determining attorney's fees under the Prompt Pay Act, the trial court should have determined which was the substantially prevailing party as a whole, considering all the claims together.

       <p>
        Plaintiff prevailed on all claims at trial and the remittitur order clearly stated the reduction in damages was simply due to the jury's miscalculation, and the new award of damages was the maximum amount the jury could award.

       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in finding that a contractor that brought suit against developers was the substantially prevailing party under the Prompt Pay Act. The contractor prevailed on a large number of its claims, but the developers prevailed on only one of many, and the contractor had a net award of over $36,000. Reed v. Zurn, 187 Vt. 613, 992 A.2d 1061 (mem.) (2010).

        Evidence supported the trial court's findings that a carpet company was prepared to uphold the parties' plan to replace defective carpeting and that the homeowners were not credible in representing that the company's charges to their credit card were not authorized. These findings supported the finding of lack of good faith under the attorney's fees provision of the Prompt Pay Act. First Quality Carpets, Inc. v. Kirschbaum, 191 Vt. 28, 54 A.3d 465 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no merit to homeowners' argument that the trial court erred when it did not again explicitly recite its finding of bad faith when awarding attorney's fees to a carpet company under the Prompt Payment Act. The trial court already stated its conclusion as to the homeowners' lack of good faith when deciding the merits; having already spoken on this issue once, the fee statute required no redundancy on the issue when addressing attorney's fees. First Quality Carpets, Inc. v. Kirschbaum, 191 Vt. 28, 54 A.3d 465 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a suit by a contractor against developers, there was a sufficient finding of a lack of good faith on the developers' part under the Prompt Pay Act. The record was replete with evidence of one developer's close involvement in the project, his knowledge and approval of the work the contractor was doing, his payment for that work based on the first two invoices and his agents' advice, his abrupt decision to terminate the contractor, and his refusal to meet with the contractor to discuss their differences.

        July 1 default date of the statute concerning the effective date of laws cannot apply to invalidate the Legislature's intent to accomplish exactly the opposite as expressed in its repeal of the sunset provision of the attorney's fees provision of the Prompt Pay Act; nor does the statutory prohibition against ex post facto reanimation of expired legislation apply to the alteration of a statute if passed before the affected statute has expired, as with the Legislature's repeal of the sunset provision. Thus, in accordance with the Legislature's explicit and undisputed intention, the attorney's fees provision of the Prompt Pay Act remained in effect after June 30, 1996. First Quality Carpets, Inc. v. Kirschbaum, 191 Vt. 28, 54 A.3d 465 (2012).

       <p>
        Since the Vermont Code forbids an application of the default date of the statute concerning the effective date of laws to frustrate plain legislative intent, and since the court is to effectuate that intent, the Legislature's repeal of the sunset provision of the attorney's fees provision of the Prompt Pay Act must be read as taking effect before any unintended nullification by default. Accordingly, the attorney's fees provision continued in effect after June 30, 1996. First Quality Carpets, Inc. v. Kirschbaum, 191 Vt. 28, 54 A.3d 465 (2012).

        Trial court did not err in denying a contractor a penalty for a payment withheld by a developer based on the contractor's removal of sand from the job site without the developer's permission. Under the circumstances, where the developer had difficulty ascertaining exactly how much sand the contractor had removed from the construction site and the developer reasonably believed it was also entitled to trucking and spreading costs for the sand, the amount withheld by the developer was reasonable, and the evidence supported the finding that the amount was withheld in good faith.

    1 provides: "(a) The General Assembly finds:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(1) Vermont has long relied on economic activity relating to working farms and forestland in the State. These working lands, and the people who work the land, are part of the State's cultural and ecological heritage, and Vermont has made major policy and budget commitments in recent years in support of working lands enterprises. Farm and forest enterprises need a robust system of infrastructure to support their economic and ecological activities, and that infrastructure requires a strong economic base consisting of dealers, manufacturers, and repair facilities. Initiatives to help strengthen farm and forest working lands infrastructure are in the best interest of the State.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) Snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles have a significant economic impact in the State, including the distribution and sale of these vehicles, use by residents, ski areas, and emergency responders, as well as tourists that come to enjoy riding snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles in Vermont. It is in the best interest of the State to ensure that Vermont consumers who want to purchase snowmobiles and all-terrain vehicles have access to a competitive marketplace and a strong network of dealers, suppliers, and repair facilities in the State.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(3) The distribution and sale of equipment, snowmobiles, and all-terrain vehicles within this State vitally affects the general economy of the State and the public interest and the public welfare, and in order to promote the public interest and the public welfare, and in the exercise of its police power, it is necessary to regulate equipment, snowmobile, and all-terrain vehicle suppliers and their representatives, and to regulate dealer agreements issued by suppliers who are doing business in this State, in order to protect and preserve the investments and properties of the citizens of this State.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(4) There continues to exist a disparity in bargaining power between equipment, snowmobile, and all-terrain vehicle suppliers and the independent dealer network. This disparity in bargaining power enables equipment, snowmobile, and all-terrain vehicle suppliers to compel dealers to execute dealer agreements, related contracts, and addenda that contain terms and conditions that would not routinely be agreed to by the equipment, snowmobile, and all-terrain vehicle dealer if this disparity did not exist. It therefore is in the public interest to enact legislation to prevent unfair or arbitrary treatment of equipment, snowmobile, and all-terrain vehicle dealers by equipment, snowmobile, and all-terrain vehicle suppliers. It is also in the public interest that Vermont consumers, municipalities, businesses, and others that purchase equipment, snowmobiles, and all-terrain vehicles in Vermont have access to a robust independent dealer network to obtain competitive prices when purchasing these items and to obtain warranty, recall, or other repair work.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(b) It is the intent of the General Assembly that this act be liberally construed in order to achieve its purposes."

       The Legislature finds and declares that the distribution and sale of vehicles within this State vitally affects the general economy of the State and the public interest and the public welfare, and that in order to promote the public interest and the public welfare, and in the exercise of its police power, it is necessary to regulate vehicle manufacturers, distributors, or wholesalers and factory or distributor representatives, and to regulate franchises issued by the aforementioned who are doing business in this State in order to prevent frauds, impositions, and other abuses upon its citizens and to protect and preserve the investments and properties of the citizens of this State.
      </li>
      <li id="t09p04c108s4084ol1b">
       The Legislature further finds that there continues to exist an inequality of bargaining power between motor vehicle franchisors and motor vehicle franchisees. This inequality of bargaining power enables motor vehicle franchisors to compel motor vehicle franchisees to execute franchises and related agreements that contain terms and conditions that would not routinely be agreed to by the motor vehicle franchisees if this inequality did not exist. Furthermore, as the result of the inequality of bargaining power, motor vehicle franchisees have not had the opportunity to have disputes with their motor vehicle franchisors arising out of the franchisor-franchisee relationship heard in an appropriate venue, convenient to both parties, by tribunals established by statute for the resolution of these disputes. It therefore is in the public interest to enact legislation to prevent unfair or arbitrary treatment of motor vehicle franchisees by motor vehicle franchisors. It is the Legislature's intent to have this chapter liberally construed in order to achieve its purpose.

      <li id="t09p04c108s4086ol1b">
       A schedule of compensation shall not fail to include reasonable compensation for diagnostic work as well as for repair service and labor. Time allowances for the diagnosis and performance of predelivery and warranty service shall be reasonable and adequate for the work to be performed. The hourly rate paid to a new motor vehicle dealer shall not be less than the rate charged by the dealer to customers for nonwarranty service and repairs. Each manufacturer shall compensate each of its dealers for parts used to fulfill warranty, predelivery, and recall obligations of repair and servicing at amounts not less than the retail amounts customarily charged by the dealer to its retail customers for like parts for nonwarranty work. The amounts established by a dealer to its retail customers for labor and like parts for nonwarranty work are deemed to be fair and reasonable compensation; provided, however, a manufacturer may rebut such a presumption by showing that such amount so established is unfair and unreasonable in light of the practices of at least four other franchised motor vehicle dealers in the vicinity offering the same line-make or a similar competitive line-make. A manufacturer may not otherwise recover all or any portion of its costs for compensating its motor vehicle dealers licensed in this State for warranty parts and service either by reduction in the amount due to the dealer or by separate charge, surcharge, or other imposition.

      <li id="t09p04c108s4086ol1c">
       For purposes of this section, the "retail amounts customarily charged" by the franchisee for parts may be established by submitting to the manufacturer 100 sequential nonwarranty customer-paid service repair orders or 60 days of nonwarranty customer-paid service repair orders, whichever is less in terms of total cost, covering repairs made no more than 180 days before the submission and declaring the average percentage markup. The average percentage markup so declared is the retail amount, which goes into effect 30 days following the declaration, subject to audit of the submitted repair orders by the manufacturer and adjustment of the average percentage markup based on that audit. Only retail sales not involving warranty repairs, not involving state inspection, not involving routine maintenance such as changing the oil and oil filter, and not involving accessories may be considered in calculating the average percentage markup. A manufacturer may not require a new motor vehicle dealer to establish the average percentage markup by an unduly burdensome or time-consuming method or by requiring information that is unduly burdensome or time-consuming to provide, including part-by-part or transaction-by-transaction calculations. A new motor vehicle dealer may not change the average percentage markup more than two times in one calendar year. Further, the manufacturer shall reimburse the new motor vehicle dealer for any labor performed at the retail rate customarily charged by that franchisee for the same labor when not performed in satisfaction of a warranty, provided the franchisee's rate for labor not performed in satisfaction of a warranty is routinely posted in a place conspicuous to its service customer.

       It is a violation of this section for any new motor vehicle manufacturer to fail to perform any warranty obligations or to fail to include in written notices of factory recalls to new motor vehicle owners and dealers the expected date by which necessary parts and equipment will be available to dealers for the correction of such defects, or to fail to compensate any of the new motor vehicle dealers in this State for repairs effected by a recall.
      </li>
      <li id="t09p04c108s4086ol1e">
       All claims made by new motor vehicle dealers pursuant to this section for labor and parts shall be paid within 45 days following their approval; provided, however, that the manufacturer retains the right to audit the claims and to charge back the dealer for fraudulent claims for a period of two years following payment. All claims shall be either approved or disapproved within 45 days after their receipt on forms and in the manner specified by the manufacturer, and any claim not specifically disapproved in writing within 45 days after the receipt shall be construed to be approved and payment must follow within 45 days. No claim that has been approved and paid may be charged back to the dealer unless it can be shown that the claim was false or fraudulent, that the repairs were not made properly or were unnecessary to correct the defective condition, or that the dealer failed to reasonably substantiate the claim either in accordance with the manufacturer's reasonable written procedures or by other reasonable means.

       A manufacturer shall retain the right to audit warranty claims for a period of one year after the date on which the claim is paid.

       A manufacturer shall retain the right to audit all incentive and reimbursement programs and charge back any amounts paid on claims that are false or unsubstantiated for a period of 18 months from the date on which the claim is paid or one year from the end of a program that gave rise to the payment, whichever is later.

The manufacturer has the burden of proof in any proceeding filed at the Board under this section.

The manufacturer shall also serve the protest on the new motor vehicle dealer within the 45-day period. If the manufacturer does not file a protest with the Board within 45 days, then the dealer may participate in the management of, investment in, or acquisition of another line-make of new motor vehicles or related products as set forth in its written notice of intent.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The General Assembly makes the following findings of fact:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t09p04c111As4125ol11">
       Today's international trade agreements have impacts that extend significantly beyond the bounds of traditional trade matters such as tariffs and quotas. Restrictive government procurement rules, for example, may undermine State purchasing laws and preferences that are designed to promote good jobs and a healthy environment.
      </li>
      <li id="t09p04c111As4125ol12">
       As the subject matters contained within trade agreements expand, these agreements may impact on areas traditionally governed by the states, including economic development, financial investment, environmental policies, pharmaceutical policy, recreational services, utilities and energy distribution, and agricultural subsidies. The subject matter addressed by trade agreements is constantly evolving into new areas and becomes more likely over time to infringe on State law or policy.
      </li>
      <li id="t09p04c111As4125ol13">
       Specific examples in one area important to Vermont - State economic development and environmental policies - that might be constrained by government procurement provisions in international trade agreements include buy-local laws, electronic waste recycling laws, and renewable energy purchasing requirements. Measures that conflict with obligations in one or more international trade agreements could be challenged as potential barriers to trade.
      </li>
      <li id="t09p04c111As4125ol14">
       Input from states has been essential to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative's understanding of state practices that may be impacted by policies in trade agreements. For example, after states protested that language in the Australia-United States trade agreement was ambiguous and created uncertainty as to whether it applied to Medicaid preferred drug lists, the United States specifically clarified in the Korea-United States trade agreement that similar pharmaceutical policies did not apply to Medicaid.
      </li>
      <li id="t09p04c111As4125ol15">
       Currently, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative asks state governors, without input from state legislatures, whether they will commit state purchasing to trade rules. States, through their governors, may opt into or out of trade rules dealing with government procurement.
      </li>
      <li id="t09p04c111As4125ol16">
       Historically, the General Assembly and the Governor have worked together to adopt and implement State procurement policies. The decision to consent to the coverage of Vermont under procurement provisions of international trade agreements should also include consultation with and agreement by the Legislative Branch.
      </li>
      <li id="t09p04c111As4125ol17">
       If future trade rules permit states to opt into or out of trade rules dealing with investment and services, in addition to procurement, then the General Assembly intends for the procedures in this chapter to apply to those provisions as well.
      </li>
      <li id="t09p04c111As4125ol18">
       It is important for the State to provide information and recommendations to Congress and the U.S. Trade Representative about the possible impacts of proposed trade agreements on State law and policy.

After a determination has been made by the Governor that the program is required to meet a petroleum supply shortage within the State that will significantly impair essential public services or essential economic activity, and after the Governor has complied with any notice requirements and has received any approval required by federal law, the Commissioner shall implement only that portion of the State set-aside program necessary to prevent and alleviate any energy hardships or shortages.

      The Legislature finds and declares that manufacturers, distributors, and importers of new motor vehicles should be obligated to provide speedy and less costly resolution of automobile warranty problems.
    Manufacturers should be required to provide in as expeditious a manner as possible a refund of the consumer's purchase price or payments to a lessor and lessee or a replacement vehicle that is acceptable to the consumer whenever the manufacturer is unable to make the vehicle conform with its applicable warranty.
    New motor vehicle dealers and used motor vehicle dealers cannot be sued under this chapter.

    The manufacturer may delegate responsibility to its agents or authorized dealers; provided, however, in the event the manufacturer delegates its responsibility under this chapter to its agents or authorized dealers, it shall compensate the dealer for all work performed by the dealer in satisfaction of the manufacturer's responsibility under this chapter in the manner set forth in chapter 108 of this title known as the "Motor Vehicle Manufacturers, Distributors, and Dealers' Franchising Practices Act" as that act may be from time to time amended.

       A manufacturer, its agent, or authorized dealer shall not refuse to provide a consumer with a written repair order and shall provide to the consumer each time the consumer's vehicle is brought in for examination or repair of a defect a written summary of the complaint and a fully itemized statement indicating all work performed on the vehicle including examination of the vehicle, parts, and labor.

If the manufacturer refunds the purchase price or a portion of the price to the consumer, any Vermont motor vehicle purchase and use tax paid shall be refunded by the State to the consumer in the proportionate amount.

        4176(a) states that the decision of the Vermont Motor Vehicle Arbitration Board shall be final and shall not be modified or vacated unless, on appeal to the Superior Court, a party to the arbitration proceeding proves by clear and convincing evidence that one of four errors occurred: (1) the award was procured by corruption, fraud, or other undue means; (2) there was evident partiality by the Board or corruption or misconduct prejudicing the rights of any party by the board; (3) the Board exceeded its powers; (4) the Board refused to postpone a hearing after being shown sufficient cause to do so or refused to hear evidence material to the controversy or otherwise conducted the hearing contrary to the rules promulgated by the Board so as to prejudice substantially the rights of a party.

        Where Motor Vehicle Arbitration Board found that stalling condition of vehicle was a "substantial defect which adversely affects either the safety or market value of the vehicle," failure to specify whether the affect was on safety or market value, as required by section 4172(e) of this title, was a technical deficiency not rising to the level of cognizable error.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The Vermont Motor Vehicle Arbitration Board does not have authority to reopen a final award; a party seeking to modify or vacate a Board award is required to apply to the Superior Court within thirty days of the Board's order, and since appellee failed to do so the Board's original order is reinstated. Cyr v. Subaru of America, Inc., 162 Vt. 226, 647 A.2d 706 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appellees' argument that the Vermont Motor Vehicle Arbitration Board had the authority to reopen their case pursuant to V.R.C.P. 60(b) is erroneous because the Rules of Civil Procedure do not apply to Board hearings and the express legislative appeal scheme found in 9 V.S.A.

        The New Motor Vehicle Arbitration Board violated its own rules and that violation provided jurisdiction to vacate its award where two of the Board members rendering the decision had been absent from the evidentiary hearing and had not, as the other members had, viewed and test drove the vehicle.

        4172(e) and (f) (enforcement of warranties under the New Motor Vehicle Arbitration Act) clearly set forth an objective (as opposed to a subjective) standard, neither the arbitration board nor the court erred in using such a standard to determine whether defendant-automobile company proved the affirmative defense that the alleged nonconformity did not substantially impair the use, market value, or safety of the vehicle.

       The General Assembly finds that:
       <ol>
        <li id="t09p04c120s4195ol1a1">
         Vermont is striving to build an entrepreneurial and knowledge-based economy. Attracting and nurturing small- and medium-size Internet technology ("IT") and other knowledge-based companies is an important part of this effort and will be beneficial to Vermont's future.
        </li>
        <li id="t09p04c120s4195ol1a2">
         Patents are essential to encouraging innovation, especially in the IT and knowledge-based fields. The protections afforded by the federal patent system create an incentive to invest in research and innovation, which spurs economic growth. Patent holders have every right to enforce their patents when they are infringed, and patent enforcement litigation is necessary to protect intellectual property.
        </li>
        <li id="t09p04c120s4195ol1a3">
         The General Assembly does not wish to interfere with the good faith enforcement of patents or good faith patent litigation. The General Assembly also recognizes that Vermont is preempted from passing any law that conflicts with federal patent law.
        </li>
        <li id="t09p04c120s4195ol1a4">
         Patent litigation can be technical, complex, and expensive. The expense of patent litigation, which may cost hundreds of thousands of dollars or more, can be a significant burden on small- and medium-size companies. Vermont wishes to help its businesses avoid these costs by encouraging the most efficient resolution of patent infringement claims without conflicting with federal law.
        </li>
        <li id="t09p04c120s4195ol1a5">
         In order for Vermont companies to be able to respond promptly and efficiently to patent infringement assertions against them, it is necessary that they receive specific information regarding how their product, service, or technology may have infringed the patent at issue. Receiving such information at an early stage will facilitate the resolution of claims and lessen the burden of potential litigation on Vermont companies.
        </li>
        <li id="t09p04c120s4195ol1a6">
         Abusive patent litigation, and especially the assertion of bad faith infringement claims, can harm Vermont companies. A business that receives a letter asserting such claims faces the threat of expensive and protracted litigation and may feel that it has no choice but to settle and to pay a licensing fee, even if the claim is meritless. This is especially so for small- and medium-size companies and nonprofits that lack the resources to investigate and defend themselves against infringement claims.
        </li>
        <li id="t09p04c120s4195ol1a7">
         Not only do bad faith patent infringement claims impose a significant burden on individual Vermont businesses, they also undermine Vermont's efforts to attract and nurture small- and medium-size IT and other knowledge-based companies. Funds used to avoid the threat of bad faith litigation are no longer available to invest, produce new products, expand, or hire new workers, thereby harming Vermont's economy.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t09p04c120s4195ol1b">
       Through this narrowly focused act, the General Assembly seeks to facilitate the efficient and prompt resolution of patent infringement claims, protect Vermont businesses from abusive and bad faith assertions of patent infringement, and build Vermont's economy, while at the same time respecting federal law and being careful to not interfere with legitimate patent enforcement actions.

A hearing shall be held if either party so requests. A bond ordered pursuant to this section shall not exceed $250,000.00.

      Where lessee and lessor of combination gas station and retail grocery store executed a transaction whereby lessor would install a walk-in cooler and a "modern island marketer" facility, to be financed by additional monthly rental and a one cent royalty on each gallon of gas sold, the transaction was an addendum to the lease and was itself a conventional lease agreement; it was not an investment security, in violation of this chapter for not being registered, since there was no expectation on the part of the lessees that increased profits would result substantially from the entrepreneurial or managerial efforts of the lessor.

      A security may be registered in beneficiary form if the form is authorized by this or a similar statute of the state of organization of the issuer or registering entity, the location of the registering entity's principal office, the office of its transfer agent or its office making the registration, or by this or a similar statute of the law of the state listed as the owner's address at the time of registration. A registration governed by the law of a jurisdiction in which this or similar legislation is not in force or was not in force when a registration in beneficiary form was made is nevertheless presumed to be valid and authorized as a matter of contract law.

      On death of a sole owner or the last to die of all multiple owners, ownership of securities registered in beneficiary form passes to the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survive all owners. On proof of death of all owners and compliance with any applicable requirements of the registering entity, a security registered in beneficiary form may be reregistered in the name of the beneficiary or beneficiaries who survived the death of all owners.

       A transfer on death resulting from a registration in beneficiary form by an owner whose last domicile was in this State is effective by reason of the contract recording the registration between the owner and the registering entity and this chapter and is not testamentary. "Nonprobate transfer" means a transfer described in this subsection.
      </li>
      <li id="t09p05c134s4359ol1b">
       A transferee of a nonprobate transfer is subject to liability to any probate estate of the decedent for allowed claims against that estate and statutory allowances to the decedent's spouse and children to the extent the estate is insufficient to satisfy those claims and allowances. The liability of a nonprobate transferee may not exceed the value of nonprobate transfers received by that transferee.

      <li id="t09p05c134s4359ol1e">
       Upon due notice to a nonprobate transferee, the liability imposed by this section is enforceable in proceedings in the Probate Division of the Superior Court in this State, whether or not the transferee is located in this State.

       A proceeding under this section may not be commenced unless the personal representative of the decedent's estate has received a written demand for the proceeding from the surviving spouse or a child, to the extent that statutory allowances are affected, or a creditor. If the personal representative declines or fails to commence a proceeding after demand, a person making demand may commence the proceeding in the name of the decedent's estate, at the expense of the person making the demand and not of the estate. A personal representative who declines in good faith to commence a requested proceeding incurs no personal liability for declining.

       A proceeding under this section must be commenced within one year after the decedent's death, but a proceeding on behalf of a creditor whose claim was allowed after proceedings challenging disallowance of the claim may be commenced within 60 days after final allowance of the claim.

       Unless a written notice asserting that a decedent's estate is insufficient to pay allowed claims and statutory allowances has been received from the decedent's personal representative, a trustee receiving a nonprobate transfer is released from liability under this section with respect to any assets to the trust's beneficiaries. Each beneficiary to the extent of the distribution received becomes liable for the amount of the trustee's liability attributable to those assets received by the beneficiary.

The terms and conditions so established may provide for proving death, avoiding or resolving any problems concerning fractional shares, designating primary and contingent beneficiaries, and substituting a named beneficiary's descendants to take in the place of the named beneficiary in the event of the beneficiary's death. Substitution may be indicated by appending to the name of the primary beneficiary the letters LDPS, standing for "lineal descendants per stirpes." This designation substitutes a deceased beneficiary's descendants who survive the owner for a beneficiary who does not so survive, the descendants to be identified and to share in accordance with the law of the beneficiary's domicile at the owner's death governing inheritance by descendants of an intestate. Other forms of identifying beneficiaries who are to take on one or more contingencies, and rules for providing proofs and assurances needed to satisfy reasonable concerns by registering entities regarding conditions and identities relevant to accurate implementation of registrations in beneficiary form, may be contained in a registering entity's terms and conditions.

    <p>
     "(1) Vermont farmers frequently provide housing to their employees as a benefit of agricultural work performed.

    <p>
     "(2) Farmers and their employees have a reasonable expectation that where housing is provided as a benefit of employment, each party has certain rights and responsibilities that should be mutually understood.

    </p>
    <p>
     "(5) The general assembly therefore recommends that the agency of agriculture, food and markets, the department of health, the department of labor, the department of economic, housing and community development, and other appropriate agencies make available on their websites the notice provisions set forth in 9 V.S.A.

        Evidence supported trial court's conclusion that defendant-landlord breached warranty or habitability applicable to plaintiff's residential leasehold where landlord made two unsuccessful attempts, within days of plaintiff's taking occupancy, to have toilet in apartment repaired and repair was effected only on second try after plaintiff vacated when plumbers, for the first time, used an auger and detected a toothbrush in toilet trap.

        Failure to protect a tenant's car does not implicate the warranty of habitability. Weiler v. Hooshiari, 189 Vt. 257, 19 A.3d 124 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Tenant's claim for damages to her car caused by snow and ice falling off a roof was not covered by the implied warranty of habitability. The claim involved no compromise to the tenant's personal health and safety, but rather damage to her personal property unrelated to the landlord's implied or statutory guarantee of premises "safe, clean and fit for human habitation." Weiler v. Hooshiari, 189 Vt. 257, 19 A.3d 124 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Warranty of habitability applies to premises being safe, clean and fit for human habitation; leases may include many amenities that are clearly beyond such a basic threshold. Thus, the fact that the lease included a parking space did not mean that the habitability warranty extended to parking. Weiler v. Hooshiari, 189 Vt. 257, 19 A.3d 124 (2011).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court did no err in holding that tenant's withholding of rent was allowable for the period beginning after four months of landlord inaction in regard to broken sewer line and other defects and until date repairs were made. Gokey v. Bessette, 154 Vt. 560, 580 A.2d 488 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Landlord was not entitled to withhold former tenant's security deposit for nonpayment of rent where evidence showed tenant had vacated prior to expiration of lease as result of landlord's breach of warranty of habitability through failure to repair clogged toilet. Nepveu v. Rau, 155 Vt. 373, 583 A.2d 1273 (1990).

         2. Attorney's fees.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Plain language of the statutory warranty of habitability indicates that a tenant is entitled to reasonable attorney's fees if the landlord fails to comply with the landlord's obligations for habitability. The statute does not require a tenant to receive an overall net gain in the lawsuit - it requires only that tenants prove a breach of the warranty of habitability. Kwon v. Eaton, 188 Vt. 623, 8 A.3d 1043 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plain language of the statutory warranty of habitability does not require a party to establish that it was the prevailing party. Rather, it grants attorney's fees to a tenant when the landlord fails to comply with the landlord's obligations for habitability. Kwon v. Eaton, 188 Vt. 623, 8 A.3d 1043 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although landlords received a net judgment in a rent dispute, tenants prevailed on their claims for breach of the warranty of habitability and consumer fraud. Thus, they were entitled to recover attorney's fees under the statute dealing with the warranty of habitability, which did not require a tenant to receive an overall net gain or to establish that it was the prevailing party; even if they received no additional damages on their consumer fraud claim, the attorney's fee award was sufficiently supported by the jury's verdict that landlords violated the warranty of habitability. Kwon v. Eaton, 188 Vt. 623, 8 A.3d 1043 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Award of attorney's fees to tenants on their breach of the warranty of habitability claim was not unreasonable. The trial court found that the breach of warranty of habitability claim was more difficult than the landlords' unpaid rent claim; the six tenants lived outside of Vermont, so counsel necessarily had to spend additional time communicating with each of them and attempting to coordinate with them; and the tenants' fee award was only twenty hours more than the landlords' fee award, and in fact was nine hours less than the landlords requested for their own fee award. Kwon v. Eaton, 188 Vt. 623, 8 A.3d 1043 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Tenants are entitled to attorney's fees under Residential Rental Agreements Act. Bisson v. Ward, 160 Vt. 343, 628 A.2d 1256 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Tenant who prevailed on breach of warranty of habitability claims was entitled to recover attorney's fees even though she was represented by Vermont Legal Aid at no cost to her. Bisson v. Ward, 160 Vt. 343, 628 A.2d 1256 (1993).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Because the notice provision in this section has no discernible purpose in latent defect cases where landlords already have actual written notice of a habitability problem from someone other than a tenant, enactment of the Residential Rental Agreements Act did not preempt common-law warranty of habitability actions involving latent defects of which a landlord already had actual knowledge.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Because the parties had a contract for deed instead of a landlord-tenant relationship, the failure of defendant to give notice under the statute requiring that a tenant give a landlord notice before making repairs was not a bar to recovery based on unjust enrichment. Kellogg v. Shushereba, 194 Vt. 446, 82 A.3d 1121 (2013).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        There was sufficient evidence of willful and wanton conduct by the landlord for the trial court to make an award of punitive damages. The landlord took far more than a reasonable time to address heat and water issues; did not offer to pay for the tenant to stay in a hotel room until he was told by code enforcement that he had to do so; used propane heaters in the basement; fraudulently represented to the city that the apartment was not occupied so he could avoid providing the tenant with lead-paint notices; and had the tenant's car towed to force her out of the premises. Kwon v. Edson, - Vt.
    - , 217 A.3d 935 (Aug. 23, 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because there was no evidence that the landlords had actual notice of a habitability defect that led to a fire, the tenants' statutory habitability claim failed as a matter of law. Terry v. O'Brien, 200 Vt. 511, 134 A.3d 203 (2015).

         6. Punitive damages.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Residential Rental Agreements Act does not contain unambiguous language precluding an award of punitive damages and its language is not inconsistent with the common law or exclusive as to remedy. Therefore, the common-law principle survives, and in an appropriate case punitive damages can be awarded for breaches of the implied warranty of habitability. Kwon v. Edson, - Vt.

        Landlord was not entitled to withhold former tenant's security deposit for nonpayment of rent where evidence showed tenant had vacated prior to expiration of lease as result of landlord's breach of warranty of habitability through failure to repair clogged toilet.

         2. Compliance with statute.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Landlord's failure to use the forwarding addresses provided by tenants when sending security deposit statements, rather than the emergency contact addresses they provided two years earlier, constituted a violation of the security deposit statute. The conclusion that a tenant's "last-known address" should be the forwarding address provided by the tenant was consistent with the statute. In re Soon Kwon, 189 Vt. 598, 19 A.3d 139 (mem.) (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont Supreme Court reads the undefined word "return" in subsec. (e) of the security deposit statute as meaning compliance with subsec. (d), the manner of notice subsection. The statute provides an explicit forfeiture remedy for noncompliance with subsec. (d); therefore, the court could not allow an alternative method of giving notice, and there was no merit to a landlord's argument that because the tenants were not prejudiced by noncompliance with respect to the method of giving notice, the landlord should not be denied access to their security deposits. In re Soon Kwon, 189 Vt. 598, 19 A.3d 139 (mem.) (2011).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Requirement by city ordinance that a landlord use certified mail to send security deposit was consistent with the Landlord and Tenant Act. It expressly authorized local towns and cities to adopt provisions to supplement the Act's "minimum protections," which would clearly encompass the city's certified-mail requirement. In re Soon Kwon, 189 Vt. 598, 19 A.3d 139 (mem.) (2011).

        Statute regarding a tenant's abandoned property is not made obsolete; it has continued viability in situations where a residential tenant abandons or vacates a dwelling unit without being formally evicted, and the statute governing a tenant's property remaining on the premises after an eviction applies in circumstances where the abandonment statute does not.

        Because the tenants were still present on the property when the sheriff arrived to execute the writ of possession, the trial court correctly concluded that their personal property was not "abandoned" under the statute regarding a tenant's abandoned property.

       <p>
        Retaliatory conduct prohibited by this section is not limited to eviction actions or otherwise restricted by modifiers to the term "action"; the language, prohibiting an action or threat of an action, is sufficiently broad and evinces the legislative intent to prohibit the nonrenewal of a fixed term lease and resultant summary proceedings instituted at the expiration of such a lease as reprisal for statutorily protected tenant activity. Houle v. Quenneville, 173 Vt. 80, 787 A.2d 1258 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        In finding that landlords' notice of nonrenewal was not retaliatory, the court properly considered the fact that landlords had completed most of the repairs of which tenants complained, and that, despite tenants' initial threat to withhold rent, they had not done so and landlords had abandoned their attempt to evict tenants during the lease term. Houle v. Quenneville, 173 Vt. 80, 787 A.2d 1258 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where tenants invoke the defense of retaliatory conduct in response to a notice of nonrenewal of a fixed term lease, tenants' protected activity must precede the notice of nonrenewal and expiration of the lease term. Houle v. Quenneville, 173 Vt. 80, 787 A.2d 1258 (2001).

         "Farm employee" means an individual employed by a farm employer for farming operations.
        </li>
        <li id="t09p07c137sub03s4469aol1a2">
         "Farm employer" means a person earning at least one-half of his or her annual gross income from the business of farming as that term is defined in Section 1.175-3 of the regulations issued by the U.S. Department of the Treasury under the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, as amended.
        </li>
        <li id="t09p07c137sub03s4469aol1a3">
         "Housing provided as a benefit of farm employment" means housing owned or controlled by the farm employer, whether located on or off the farm premises and provided for the occupancy of the farm employee and the farm employee's family or household members for no payment other than the farm employee's labor. Payment of utility and fuel charges paid by the farm employee does not affect the designation of housing provided as a benefit of farm employment.

       Unless otherwise provided in a written employment contract, a farm employer who provides housing to a farm employee and the farm employee's family or household members as a benefit of the employment may terminate that benefit and all rights of the employee and the employee's family or household members to occupy the housing when the employee's employment is terminated.
      </li>
      <li id="t09p07c137sub03s4469aol1c">
       The termination of the housing benefit shall be by written notice served upon the former farm employee by a law enforcement officer in accordance with Rule 4 of the Vermont Rules of Civil Procedure. The notice shall be served together with a summons and complaint seeking a writ of possession under this section to remove the former farm employee from occupancy of the farm housing. The notice shall include the following statements, in boldface print:
      </li>
      <li id="t09p07c137sub03s4469aol1d">
       A farm employer shall be entitled to a show cause hearing on an expedited basis for the purpose of demonstrating that the failure of the former farm employee to vacate the farm housing is causing an actual hardship to the farm employer. The show cause hearing shall be held not less than 10 calendar days after service on the former employee of the notice described in subsection (c) of this section. The issue before the court at the hearing shall be whether the farm employer has suffered actual hardship because of the unavailability of the farm housing for a replacement employee.
      </li>
      <li id="t09p07c137sub03s4469aol1e">
       If the court finds that the farm employer has suffered actual hardship because of the unavailability of the farm housing for a replacement employee, the court shall enter an order approving a writ of possession, which shall be executed not earlier than five business days nor later than 30 days after the writ is served, to put the plaintiff into possession.

       If the court does not make a finding on behalf of the farm employer, the farm employer may seek an eviction pursuant to sections 4467 and 4468 of this title and 12 V.S.A. chapter 169, subchapter 3. In any action pursuant to this section, the farm employer may file a motion for payment of the reasonable rental value of the premises into court pursuant to <cite class="vt-code">12 V.S.A. ยง 4853a</cite>.

       The right of a former farm employee to pursue any claim that he or she may have against the former farm employer by way of a counterclaim in a civil action brought pursuant to this section is expressly preserved. The assertion of a counterclaim shall not have the effect of delaying or preventing the removal of the employee from the housing, nor shall the employee be entitled to obtain injunctive relief in the form of repossession of farm housing. A former employee who prevails on a counterclaim shall be entitled to relief as provided by applicable law.

        <p>
         The 1992 amendment to the Public Accommodations Act was intended to make it explicit that governmental entities are places of public accommodation, consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Rather than adopt the bifurcated structure of the ADA in which all public entities are subject to the anti-discrimination law under Subchapter II, and other places of public accommodations (i.e. private enterprises that cater to the public) are subject to the law under Subchapter III, the Legislature simply incorporated governmental entities into a newly added definition of "public accommodation" with the expectation that the law would apply to them in general. Department of Corrections v. Human Rights Commission, 181 Vt. 225, 917 A.2d 451 (December 29, 2006).
        </p>
        <p>
         The general scheme of the public accommodations statute, viewed in light of its underlying purpose and history, demonstrates that the Legislature intended to make all governmental entities subject to the public accommodations law. The Legislature has not exempted State prisons, or any other public entity for that matter, from a law that was intended to apply to governmental entities in general. Department of Corrections v. Human Rights Commission, 181 Vt. 225, 917 A.2d 451 (December 29, 2006).
        </p>
        <p>
         As a remedial statute, the Fair Housing and Public Accommodations Act must be liberally construed in order to "suppress the evil and advance the remedy" intended by the Legislature. Human Rights Commission v. Benevolent & Protective Order of Elks, 176 Vt. 125, 839 A.2d 576 (2003).

          3. Exhaustion of remedies.
         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         When a couple claimed that a town and its officials discriminated against them in zoning and permitting decisions on the basis of their sexual orientation, the fact that they had filed a complaint with the Vermont Human Rights Commission, but withdrew the complaint before it was resolved, did not preclude them from litigating their Vermont Fair Housing Act claim in federal court. Ernst v. Kauffman, 50 F. Supp. 3d 553 (D. Vt. 2014).
        </p>
        <p>
         As a policy matter, the Legislature imposed a strict administrative exhaustion requirement upon those seeking to raise harassment claims against schools under the Vermont Public Accommodations Act. This is particularly critical with respect to hostile-school-environment claims based on student-to-student conduct unrelated to harassment by school personnel. Allen v. University of Vermont, 185 Vt. 518, 973 A.2d 1183 (2009).
        </p>
        <p>
         Because exhaustion of administrative remedies is a critical predicate to a Vermont Public Accommodations Act action claiming a hostile school environment based on student-to-student conduct, a university was entitled to avoid litigation by addressing duly reported harassment. That did not occur here, and thus a student who claimed harassment by a fellow student failed to demonstrate that the futility exception to the exhaustion requirement applied. Allen v. University of Vermont, 185 Vt. 518, 973 A.2d 1183 (2009).
        </p>
        <p>
         College student's argument that she should not have to exhaust her administrative remedies as required by statute because a university did not inform her plainly enough of her right to pursue a complaint under its harassment policy after she claimed that she was raped by a fellow student failed both as an appeal to fairness and as an invitation to rewrite the statute. Assuming, for argument's sake, that the university "dropped the ball" in failing to refer her to the officials designated to respond to harassment complaints, the student showed no prejudice that could not have been cured by filing a claim of harassment after harassment was specifically alleged in her civil lawsuit under the Vermont Public Accommodations Act; furthermore, the procedures were not hidden, and nothing suggested that the university, which responded to the rape complaint, sought to defeat or discourage a sexual harassment complaint. Allen v. University of Vermont, 185 Vt. 518, 973 A.2d 1183 (2009).
        </p>
        <p>
         Plaintiff's Vermont Public Accommodations Act cause of action does not exist outside of the statute that makes it explicitly conditioned upon exhaustion of administrative remedies by actual notice to the designated employee, unless excused by specific statutory exceptions. Those exceptions do not recognize constructive notice to designated persons through reports to other, non-designated employees. Allen v. University of Vermont, 185 Vt. 518, 973 A.2d 1183 (2009).

          4. Harassment.
         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         Isolated incidents of misconduct ordinarily are not "pervasive" in nature and thus will not support an action under the Vermont Public Accommodations Act (VPAA) alleging a hostile school environment created by student-student harassment. A plaintiff bringing a VPAA action based on a hostile school environment created by student-student harassment must show, in addition to exhaustion of administrative remedies, that he or she was the victim of harassing conduct so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it deprived him or her of access to the educational opportunities or benefits provided by the school.

         When a couple claimed that a town and its officials discriminated against them in zoning and permitting decisions on the basis of their sexual orientation, the collateral estoppel did not bar their Vermont Fair Housing Act (VFHA) claim even though the State environmental court ruled that neighbors' permits were properly issued; the environmental court did not have jurisdiction to rule on a VFHA discrimination claim, and the couple did not have an opportunity to raise this issue previously.

         .
        </h5>
        <p>
         The 1992 amendment to the Public Accommodations Act was intended to make it explicit that governmental entities are places of public accommodation, consistent with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). Rather than adopt the bifurcated structure of the ADA in which all public entities are subject to the anti-discrimination law under Subchapter II, and other places of public accommodations (i.e. private enterprises that cater to the public) are subject to the law under Subchapter III, the Legislature simply incorporated governmental entities into a newly added definition of "public accommodation" with the expectation that the law would apply to them in general. Department of Corrections v. Human Rights Commission, 181 Vt. 225, 917 A.2d 451 (December 29, 2006).
        </p>
        <p>
         Factors to determine whether a club is private or public include: (a) whether the group's membership is genuinely selective; (b) the amount of control the existing members have over the club's operations; (c) the history of the organization; (d) the use of club facilities by non-members; (e) whether the organization advertises or directs its publicity to anyone other than members; (f) the purpose of the organization; and (g) any profit motive. Human Rights Commission v. Benevolent & Protective Order of Elks, 176 Vt. 125, 839 A.2d 576 (2003).
        </p>
        <p>
         The principal factor in determining whether a club fits within the definition of "place of public accommodation" is a club's selectivity and it is not enough for an organization to appear selective on paper while in fact offering memberships to the general public; rather, an organization must be genuinely selective. Human Rights Commission v. Benevolent & Protective Order of Elks, 176 Vt. 125, 839 A.2d 576 (2003).

         The Vermont Public Accommodations Act encompasses claims against school officials, as owners and operators of places of public accommodation, as well as their agents and employees, for unlawful in-school harassment of their students, even when the harassing conduct is perpetrated by other students. Washington v. Pierce, 179 Vt. 318, 895 A.2d 173 (December 16, 2005).

        <p>
         Three-year personal injury statute of limitations, rather than six-year statute governing civil actions, applied to claims brought under federal and state law alleging discrimination on basis of handicap. Morse v. University of Vermont, 776 F. Supp. 844 (D. Vt. 1991), affirmed in part and reversed in part, 973 F.2d 122 (2d Cir. 1992).
        </p>
        <p>
         Notwithstanding that university offered handicapped student time extension to complete her degree work, university's refusal to grant student her degree when she had completed the requisite course hours and grade point average was not a separate instance of violation of antidiscrimination laws for statute of limitation purposes, but rather was continuing impact of alleged discriminatory act of advising student she had been terminated from her master's program. Morse v. University of Vermont, 776 F. Supp. 844 (D. Vt. 1991), affirmed in part and reversed and part, 973 F.2d 122 (2d Cir. 1992).
        </p>
        <p>
         Student's discrimination on basis of handicap claim against university accrued when she learned that university had terminated her from master's program, and when university notified her she would not be considered for readmission to program; the fact that university entertained appeals did not toll the running of the statute. Morse v. University of Vermont, 776 F. Supp. 844 (D. Vt. 1991), affirmed in part and reversed in part, 973 F.2d 122 (2d Cir. 1992).

         No direct evidence is necessary to prove a disparate-treatment discrimination claim since intentional discrimination may be shown by circumstantial evidence. Human Rights Commission v. LaBrie, Inc., 164 Vt. 237, 668 A.2d 659 (1995).
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence of a discriminatory practice prior to civil rights legislation, coupled with a post-legislation pattern of maintaining the status quo, may be sufficient to establish the intent to continue the discrimination through a neutral policy; thus, use by owners of a mobile home park, who excluded minor children from the park until repeal of provision allowing discrimination based on age in rental of mobile home lots under certain conditions, of an amended occupancy provision in their leases establishing a two person maximum, which appeared neutral on its face but was adopted for the purpose of eliminating or limiting persons with minor children from the park, was sufficient to establish discriminatory intent.

In conducting an investigation, the Commission or its designated representative shall have access at all reasonable times to premises, records, documents, individuals, and other evidence or possible sources of evidence and may examine, record, and copy those materials and take and record the testimony or statements of such persons as are reasonably necessary. The Commission shall make every reasonable effort to interview each relevant and noncumulative witness identified by a party.

If the case is not disposed of by informal means in a manner satisfactory to a majority of the Commission within six months, it shall either bring an action in Superior Court as provided in section 4553 of this title or dismiss the proceedings, unless an extension is necessary to complete ongoing good faith negotiations and all parties consent to the extension.

        Provision requiring the Human Rights Commission to bring an action against the State within six months does not violate the Common Benefits Clause. The State is not specially protected from lawsuits, as the Commission is free to bring an action against the State at any point in the six-month period; moreover, the six-month time limitation applies not only to actions the Commission brings against the State, but to all the Commission's actions.

        There is a lack of precision in the phrasing of the provision requiring the Human Rights Commission to bring an action within six months; nonetheless, within it the Vermont Supreme Court finds the necessary components of a mandatory time limit. By phrasing the Commission's options in the way it does - "it shall either bring an action. .. or dismiss the proceedings" - the Legislature sets a limit on the Commission's jurisdiction; furthermore, were these words directory in nature, there would be no reason to include statutory language governing an extension of the Commission's ability to bring suit.

        Vermont Supreme Court accords deference to the policy choices made by the Legislature and finds a six-month time limit for the Human Rights Commission to bring an action against a State agency after failure of conciliation to be reasonable, mandatory, and not in violation of the Common Benefits Clause of the Vermont Constitution. Thus, an action by the Commission against the State was properly dismissed as time-barred. Vermont Human Rights Comm'n v. State, 192 Vt. 552, 60 A.3d 702 (2012).

       <p>
        There are two components to the test for whether some information deserves trade secret protection: the first is whether the information has independent economic value that is not readily ascertainable to others; the second is whether reasonable efforts were made to maintain the information's secrecy. Dicks v. Jensen, 172 Vt. 43, 768 A.2d 1279 (mem.) (2001).

       </h5>
       <p>
        A customer list can be a protected trade secret. Dicks v. Jensen, 172 Vt. 43, 768 A.2d 1279 (mem.) (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether a customer list is readily ascertainable, no general and invariable rule can be laid down, but rather it is necessary to look to the conduct of each party and the particular information at issue. Dicks v. Jensen, 172 Vt. 43, 768 A.2d 1279 (mem.) (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Given the lack of a standard benchmark for "readily ascertainable" and the extremely factual nature of the inquiry, it could not be said that, as a matter of law, plaintiff's customer list was not a trade secret; therefore, summary judgment on this issue was error. Dicks v. Jensen, 172 Vt. 43, 768 A.2d 1279 (mem.) (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to claim trade secret protection for his customer list, the burden was on plaintiff to demonstrate that he pursued an active course of conduct designed to inform his employees that the list was to remain confidential Dicks v. Jensen, 172 Vt. 43, 768 A.2d 1279 (mem.) (2001).

As used in this subdivision, "inconvenient venue" for State law claims means a place other than the state in which the individual resides or the contract was consummated, and for federal law claims means a place other than the federal judicial district where the individual resides or the contract was consummated. Notwithstanding this subdivision, a standard-form contract may include a term requiring that resolution of legal claims takes place in a State or federal court in Vermont.

       Relation to common law and the Uniform Commercial Code.
    
    In determining whether the terms described in subsection (a) of this section are unenforceable, a court shall consider the principles that normally guide courts in this State in determining whether unconscionable terms are enforceable. Additionally, the common law and Uniform Commercial Code shall guide courts in determining the enforceability of unfair terms not specifically identified in subsection (a) of this section.

           refuse to enforce the entire contract or the specific part, clause, or provision containing the illegal or unconscionable term; or

        </li>
        <li id="t09p08c152s6055ol1c2">
         In performing its analysis under this subsection, the court may consider the actual purposes of the contracting parties and whether severing the term would create an incentive for contract drafters to include similar illegal or unconscionable terms.
