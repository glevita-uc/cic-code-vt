        Because road in question was built by State over land it acquired to build a road for public use, road was a public road under common law. Okemo Mountain, Inc. v. Town of Ludlow, 171 Vt. 201, 762 A.2d 1219 (2000).

        There is no distinction between "public road" and "highway" as they are commonly understood and defined; the definition of highway provided by subdiv. (12) is consistent with the plain meaning of "public road or highway," a road over which the public has a right to pass and which the government has the obligation to maintain.

        Transportation Board is empowered to require development of the record, and it must apply a de novo, nondeferential standard of review to the Vermont Agency of Transportation's dispute-resolution decisions under the Agency's administrative-claims process. Given these due process protections, there was no basis to allow a construction company to avoid that legislatively authorized administrative review and have its contract dispute reviewed initially in the Superior Court instead of exhausting its administrative remedies.

        The plain language of the statute governing the powers and duties of the Transportation Board does not limit who may appeal a decision of the Board. Liberally construing this provision, the statute allows, with limited exception, any party properly before the Board, including the Agency of Transportation, to appeal to the Supreme Court. W.M. Schultz Constr., Inc. v. Vt. Agency of Transp., 209 Vt. 146, 203 A.3d 1205 (2018).

        Before it can be a final, appealable order under subsec. (c) of this section, a board order must dispose of all matters that should or could properly be settled at the time and in the proceeding then before the board. In re Central Vermont Railway, 148 Vt. 177, 530 A.2d 579 (1987). (Decided under former 3 V.S.A.

       <p>
        Where Transportation Board order allocating annual maintenance costs of signal light at railroad grade crossing equally between town and railroad directed the parties to agree on a computation of the annual maintenance costs to be used as a base for the allocation and provided that if the board did not receive the agreement for approval by a specified time the board would compute the annual maintenance costs, since the ultimate issue litigated by the parties was whether the actual amount they would be required to contribute toward maintenance of the crossing was "just and equitable," as required by 30 V.S.A.
        §
        1379, in the absence of an established annual maintenance cost figure, the Board's order was not a final appealable order under subsec. (c) of this section. In re Central Vermont Railway, 148 Vt. 177, 530 A.2d 579 (1987). (Decided under former 3 V.S.A.

Sec. 39(3) of 1999 Acts and Resolves No. 18 provides that "[t]he department of buildings and general services is authorized to operate rest areas, information and welcome centers as state or private facilities."

       <p>
        The State had a duty to keep culverts on State highways in reasonably safe condition and that duty, as affecting the State's liability to pay damages occasioned by defects in culverts, was not measured by the exercise of ordinary care and diligence, but the State was not liable as insurer; as the statute imposed the duty of keeping culverts in good and sufficient repair, if the State was chargeable with any fault in respect of this duty, liability attached. Zeno's Bakery, Inc. v. State, 105 Vt. 370, 166 A. 379 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order that there might be liability on the part of the State, it must appear that the accident which caused the injuries occurred while the plaintiffs were passing over the culvert in question and that the insufficiency or want of repair of the structure itself was the direct cause of the injuries sustained. 1934-36 Op. Atty. Gen. 343.
       </p>
       <p>
        Lack of a guard rail, suitable to the place and condition, could constitute an insufficiency or want of repair of the culvert. 1934-36 Op. Atty. Gen. 343.

However, the Agency may lease or license State-owned property under its jurisdiction for less than fair market value when the Agency determines that the proposed occupancy or use serves a public purpose or that there exist other relevant factors, such as a prior course of dealing between the parties, that justify setting rent at less than fair market value.

       Unless otherwise required by federal law, the Agency shall assess, collect, and deposit in the Transportation Fund a reasonable charge or payment with respect to leases or licenses for access to or use of State-owned rights-of-way by providers of broadband or wireless communications facilities or services. The Agency may waive such charge or payment in whole or in part if the provider offers to provide comparable value to the State so as to meet the public good as determined by the Agency and the Department of Public Service. For the purposes of this section, the term "comparable value to the State" shall be construed broadly to further the State's interest in ubiquitous broadband and wireless service availability at reasonable cost. Any waiver of charges or payments for comparable value to the State granted by the Agency may not exceed five years. Thereafter, the Agency may extend any waiver granted for an additional period not to exceed five years if the Agency makes affirmative written findings demonstrating that the State has received and will continue to receive value that is comparable to the value to the provider of the waiver, or it may revise the terms of the waiver in order to do so.

       <p>
        The three-rod roadway width presumption applies regardless of whether the existing traveled way has wandered from its original route. Town of South Hero v. Wood, 179 Vt. 417, 898 A.2d 756 (April 7, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Town was entitled to rely upon the three-rod presumption when maintaining roads where the dedication was based in part on the public's long use of the land as a road and in part on defendants' long acquiescence in the town's maintenance of the road as a town highway. Town of South Hero v. Wood, 179 Vt. 417, 898 A.2d 756 (April 7, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        A town could not justify further inland relocations of a road by successive applications of the statutory three-rod presumption because doing so would amount to a unilateral change in the location of the easement without the consent of defendants, the owners of the servient estates. Accordingly, the town failed in its argument that the statute allowed it to undertake gradual changes that moved the road beyond the inland boundary established by the dedication without compensating defendants. Town of South Hero v. Wood, 179 Vt. 417, 898 A.2d 756 (April 7, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case involving the relocation of a highway, a stone wall built in 1908 that had remained since then as a permanent boundary, but which was within the three-rod right of way, was properly considered by the jury in arriving at the fair market value of the property taken, where no survey or resurvey of the existing highway had been preserved or record made, nor boundaries ascertained. Colson v. State Highway Board, 122 Vt. 392, 173 A.2d 849 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was on file a record of the highway as being laid out, but the survey could not be rerun or location limits determined, the Board could not grant a permit for a pole line within a three-rod limit. 1930-32 Op. Atty. Gen. 176.

       For the purposes of this and the following section of this title, the word "survey" means:
       <ol>
        <li id="t19c01s33ol1a1">
         a survey of the existing highway where no previous survey has been properly recorded or the record of a previous survey has not been preserved, or the terminations and boundaries of a previous survey cannot be determined; or
        </li>
        <li id="t19c01s33ol1a2">
         a resurvey to reproduce a previous survey or surveys.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t19c01s33ol1b">
       The Agency, for State highways, and the selectboard, for town highways, may authorize the survey of existing highways, and the rights-of-way, easements, or fee title associated with those highways. The purpose of the survey shall be to verify the location and width of the existing right-of-way, easement, or fee title and to determine the extent of the interest of the public in the title. A notice of intent to survey an existing highway shall be sent to all known abutting landowners by certified mail. In performance of the survey, the Agency or selectboard shall attempt to determine from all available evidence the type of highway, its location on the ground, its width, and the record title holder. The survey shall be based on all available evidence, including survey descriptions, original survey bills, plats, plans, maps, photographs, discontinuances, court documents, Public Service Board orders, actions by the selectboard, existing monumentation, present road location, nearby intersections, topography, vegetation, past and current use patterns, and other additional information generally relied on by land surveyors. The surveys shall be carried out in accordance with the provisions of 26 V.S.A. chapter 45.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c01s33ol1c">
       If, during the performance of the survey process under this section, the location or limits, or both, of the right-of-way, easement, or fee title cannot be determined on the ground from the available evidence, the Agency or the selectboard may instead cause a survey to be made of the centerline of the existing traveled way and a width of one and one-half rods on each side of the centerline shall be assumed and controlled for highway purposes.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c01s33ol1d">
       Once a survey is completed, the Agency or selectboard shall cause the right-of-way, easement, or fee title to be monumented in accordance with the survey plat and in such a manner that will allow its limits to be readily apparent to all adjacent property owners. Monumentation shall be permanent and shall include not less than two intervisible monuments located on, within, or adjacent to the highway limits. Intervisible monuments shall be at intervals of not more than 200 meters. All monuments shall be referenced to the Vermont State Plane Coordinate System in accordance with applicable statutes and standards in effect.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c01s33ol1e">
       The Agency or selectboard shall have the survey placed on record in the town clerk's office in each town in which the survey is performed. The record shall include survey plats prepared and filed in accordance with <cite class="vt-code">27 V.S.A. §§ 1401-1406</cite>, a written description of the survey, and an opinion naming the record title holder. The description and plat shall include coordinates referenced to the Vermont State Plane Coordinate System. All recorded or filed material shall be indexed.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c01s33ol1f">
       Notice of the completion of the survey shall be sent to all known abutting landowners by certified mail, not less than 30 days before the survey results are filed with the appropriate town clerk, together with notice of statutory rights of appeal and damages.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c01s33ol1g">
       Upon recordation of the survey and upon final disposition of statutory appeals, all abutting and surrounding lands outside the limits of the survey shall be deemed discontinued, unless any rights deemed necessary are expressly reserved and clearly shown on the recorded survey plat. Title to the discontinued property shall belong to the owners of the abutting lands. If it is located between the lands of two different owners, it shall be returned to the lots to which it originally belonged, if they can be determined; if not, it shall be equally divided between the owners of the lands on each side.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c01s33ol1h">
       A property owner aggrieved by a survey may seek damages for the loss of property or for the loss of an interest in property.

      (c)
    The Transportation Alternatives Grant Program is created. The Grant Program shall be administered by the Agency, and shall be funded in the amount provided for in <cite class="vt-code">23 U.S.C. § 133(h)</cite>, less the funds set aside for the Recreational Trails Program. Awards shall be made to eligible entities as defined under <cite class="vt-code">23 U.S.C. § 133(h)</cite>, and awards under the Grant Program shall be limited to the activities authorized under federal law and shall not exceed $300,000.00 per grant allocation.
     </p>
     <p>
      (d)
    Eligible entities awarded a grant must provide all funds required to match federal funds awarded for a Transportation Alternatives project. All grant awards shall be decided and awarded by the Agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      (e)
    Transportation Alternatives grant awards shall be announced annually by the Agency not earlier than December and not later than the following March.
     </p>
     <p>
      (f) (1)
    In fiscal years 2018 and 2019, all Grant Program funds shall be reserved for municipalities for environmental mitigation projects relating to stormwater and highways, including eligible salt and sand shed projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      (2) In fiscal years 2020 and 2021, Grant Program funds shall be awarded for any eligible activity and in accordance with the priorities established in subdivision (4) of this subsection.
     </p>
     <p>
      (3) In fiscal year 2022 and thereafter, $1,100,000.00 of Grant Program funds, or such lesser sum if all eligible applications amount to less than $1,100,000.00, shall be reserved for municipalities for environmental mitigation projects relating to stormwater and highways, including eligible salt and sand shed projects.
     </p>
     <p>
      (4) Regarding Grant Program funds awarded in fiscal years 2020 and 2021, and the balance of Grant Program funds not reserved for environmental mitigation projects in fiscal year 2022 and thereafter, in evaluating applications for Transportation Alternatives grants, the Agency shall give preferential weighting to projects involving as a primary feature a bicycle or pedestrian facility. The degree of preferential weighting and the circumstantial factors sufficient to overcome the weighting shall be in the complete discretion of the Agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      (g)
    The Agency shall develop an outreach and marketing effort designed to provide information to communities with respect to the benefits of participating in the Transportation Alternatives Grant Program. The outreach and marketing activities shall include apprising municipalities of the availability of grants for salt and sand sheds. The outreach effort should be directed to areas of the State historically underserved by this Program.

       For the purposes of this section and receiving State aid, all town highways shall be categorized into one or another of the following classes:

        <li id="t19c03s302ol1a1">
         Class 1 town highways are those town highways that form the extension of a State highway route and that carry a State highway route number. The Agency shall determine which highways are to be class 1 highways.

        <li id="t19c03s302ol1a2">
         Class 2 town highways are those town highways selected as the most important highways in each town. As far as practicable, they shall be selected with the purposes of securing trunk lines of improved highways from town to town and to places that by their nature have more than normal amount of traffic. The selectmen, with the approval of the Agency, shall determine which highways are to be class 2 highways.

           The minimum standards for class 3 highways are a highway negotiable under normal conditions all seasons of the year by a standard manufactured pleasure car. This would include sufficient surface and base, adequate drainage, and sufficient width capable to provide winter maintenance, except that based on safety considerations for the traveling public and municipal employees, the selectboard shall, by rule adopted under 24 V.S.A. chapter 59, and after following the process for providing notice and hearing in section 709 of this title, have authority to determine whether a class 3 highway, or section of highway, should be plowed and made negotiable during the winter. However, a property owner aggrieved by a decision of the selectboard may appeal to the Transportation Board pursuant to subdivision 5(d)(9) of this title.

        By adopting statutory highway classification system, Legislature intended State aid to be available only for roads that were maintained and passable during all parts of year. Sagar v. Warren Selectboard, 170 Vt. 167, 744 A.2d 422 (1999).

        While the statute concerning classification of town highways was enacted after the statute concerning evidence of highway completion or discontinuance, the town highway statute implicitly recognizes that a highway can be deemed "properly laid out" even if a town cannot produce a certificate of completion. Town of Granville v. Loprete, 206 Vt. 21, 178 A.3d 1013 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Towns may reclassify class 4 town highways using the same procedures as for laying out highways and meeting the standards set forth in 19 V.S.A.

       <p>
        Town had proven the course of a highway. The trial court did not err in accepting a surveyor's "best fit" determination of the course or in giving weight to the testimony of former townspeople as to the location of the road, especially in light of the surveys, maps, and photographs it considered. Town of Bethel v. Wellford, 186 Vt. 612, 987 A.2d 956 (mem.) (2009).

         5. Unidentified corridors.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Act 178 defines "unidentified corridors" in part as those highways that do not, as of July 1, 2010, appear on the town highway map prepared pursuant to the statute requiring mapping; and are not otherwise clearly observable by physical evidence of their use as a highway or trail. Although the statute does not specifically state that the physical evidence had to exist on July 1, 2010, the Court believes this is the operative date the Legislature intended because of its placement earlier within the definition of "unidentified corridors" and because the Legislature did not specify a different date. Doncaster v. Hane, 212 Vt. 37, 229 A.3d 1026 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly found that the road here was not an unidentified corridor, as there was clearly observable physical evidence of use of it by vehicles during the relevant time period, and it was unnecessary to identify the users. Doncaster v. Hane, 212 Vt. 37, 229 A.3d 1026 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a quiet title action, because it was undisputed that a road which passed through plaintiff's property to access defendants' adjacent property was a highway laid out by the town in 1800 that was never discontinued and that there was clearly observable physical evidence of its use to a point midway onto defendants' property, the trial court properly concluded as a matter of law that the highway was not an unidentified corridor that was discontinued by operation of Act 178, and correctly granted summary judgment to defendants. Bartlett v. Roberts, 212 Vt. 37, 231 A.3d 171 (2020).

        Plain language of Act 178 discontinued only unidentified corridors that were not reclassified by July 1, 2015. It did not discontinue other types of town highways, even if those highways were not included on the town highway map by that date. Doncaster v. Hane, 212 Vt. 37, 229 A.3d 1026 (2020).

       <p>
        Although selectmen are given broad authority over town roads, in reclassification cases the Legislature has placed selectmen in quasi-judicial role to hear classification petitions, with appellate jurisdiction over their action in the Superior Court; the selectmen can adopt reclassification policies to determine their action, but those policies do not bind the Superior Court in exercising its discretionary power in a practical manner, and not by technical rules.

        Plain language of Act 178 discontinued only unidentified corridors that were not reclassified by July 1, 2015. It did not discontinue other types of town highways, even if those highways were not included on the town highway map by that date. Doncaster v. Hane, 212 Vt. 37, 229 A.3d 1026 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Act 178 defines "unidentified corridors" in part as those highways that do not, as of July 1, 2010, appear on the town highway map prepared pursuant to the statute requiring mapping; and are not otherwise clearly observable by physical evidence of their use as a highway or trail. Although the statute does not specifically state that the physical evidence had to exist on July 1, 2010, the Court believes this is the operative date the Legislature intended because of its placement earlier within the definition of "unidentified corridors" and because the Legislature did not specify a different date. Doncaster v. Hane, 212 Vt. 37, 229 A.3d 1026 (2020).

       Except in the case of projects or project components involving unpaved highways, for all transportation projects and project phases managed by a municipality, including planning, development, construction, or maintenance, it is the policy of this State for municipalities to consider "complete streets" principles, which are principles of safety and accommodation of all transportation system users, regardless of age, ability, or modal preference. If, after the consideration required under this section, a project does not incorporate complete streets principles, the municipality managing the project shall make a written determination, supported by documentation and available for public inspection at the office of the municipal clerk and at the Agency of Transportation, that one or more of the following circumstances exist:
       <ol>
        <li id="t19c03s309dol1a1">
         Use of the transportation facility by pedestrians, bicyclists, or other users is prohibited by law.

        <li id="t19c03s309dol1a2">
         The cost of incorporating complete streets principles is disproportionate to the need or probable use as determined by factors such as land use, current and projected user volumes, population density, crash data, historic and natural resource constraints, and maintenance requirements. The municipality shall consult local and regional plans, as appropriate, in assessing these and any other relevant factors.

         Incorporating complete streets principles is outside the scope of a project because of its very nature.

        Town was not entitled to dismissal of property owner's action to compel plowing of town road; discretionary power of town selectboard and its obligation to protect public safety did not allow it to close a class 2 road for winter months since, by its designation, road was required to meet a standard of negotiability under normal conditions all seasons of year, and thus property owner's action alleged a refusal to act that was properly remedied by mandamus.

        While the statute imposed a duty upon a town to keep in good and sufficient repair at all seasons of the year its highways and bridges other than those on the State highway system, the imposition of that duty alone did not render a town liable for the negligent acts of its officers and employees.

        The provision of the statute requiring that a town keep its highways in repair authorized the town to operate a gravel pit to secure materials for use in road maintenance within the town; while not a "necessary" function, it was both "incident" and "subordinate" to fulfillment of the town's statutory duty.

Consistent with the history of services provided by the Vermont Local Roads Program, the purpose of the LTAP will be to provide transportation-related technical assistance and training for municipalities, including workshops, technology demonstrations, computer training, distance learning, seminars, and field and classroom instruction. If it is legally permissible for the LTAP to use the name Vermont Local Roads, the Agency may continue to use that name.

       "(d) In carrying out the Local Technical Assistance Program, the Agency shall:
      </p>
      <p>
       "(1) offer the same or substantially similar courses as were offered by the Vermont Local Roads Program, as long as demand from municipalities justifies continuing such course offerings;
      </p>

      <p>
       "(e)(1) On or before January 15, 2015, the Agency shall provide the House and Senate Committees on Transportation an LTAP work plan for fiscal year 2016 detailing how the Program will accomplish the requirements set forth in subsection (d) of this section.

      1. Purpose and effect of chapter.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     The overriding purpose of the Legislature in enacting the chapter was to see to it that the landowner should receive fair treatment when his land was taken, and in keeping with this purpose it provided for damages for business loss; the whole spirit of the law was to see to it that the landowner would get just treatment and fair compensation for the land taken away from him. Farrell v. State Highway Board, 123 Vt. 453, 194 A.2d 410 (1963).
    </p>
    <p>
     The Legislature did not intend by the passage of the chapter to set up the State Highway Board as a trial body of extended jurisdiction. American Oil Co. v. State Highway Board, 122 Vt. 496, 177 A.2d 358 (1962).
    </p>
    <p>
     The effect of the chapter was in substance to allow the question of necessity to be determined in advance and independently of questions of damage, and to ensure that courts would have to deal only with highway projects fully supported by the essential engineering studies and surveys of affected lands. State Highway Board v. Loomis, 122 Vt. 125, 165 A.2d 572 (1960).
    </p>
    <p>
     The chapter did not enlarge the authority of the Highway Board with respect to powers of condemnation. State Highway Board v. Loomis, 122 Vt. 125, 165 A.2d 572 (1960).
    </p>
    <p>
     Whatever power courts might have had with respect to State highways to establish a new highway line or a different land taking beyond the bounds of a Highway Board petition was abridged by the chapter. State Highway Board v. Loomis, 122 Vt. 125, 165 A.2d 572 (1960).

    <h5 id="t19c05-annotationsfromformer221236-2">
     <b>
      2. Construction.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     The expression "land and rights" found in the chapter referred to the nature of the interest sought to be acquired by the Highway Board, and did not refer to any of the various property interests existing in the particular land affected by the proposed taking. American Oil Co. v. State Highway Board, 122 Vt. 496, 177 A.2d 358 (1962).
    </p>
    <p>
     For purposes of the chapter, cost and value were not equivalent terms. Smith v. State Highway Board, 125 Vt. 54, 209 A.2d 495 (1965).

    <h5 id="t19c05-annotationsfromformer221236-3">
     <b>
      3. Nature of proceeding.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     Exercise of the power of eminent domain under the chapter was a proceeding in rem which established a new title and extinguished all previous rights in the subject property. City of Winooski v. State Highway Board, 124 Vt. 496, 207 A.2d 255 (1965).
    </p>
    <p>
     The chapter contemplated a single proceeding against the property in the nature of an in rem action transferring to the Highway Board the required right in the property in return for money damages representing its fair equivalent, passing in the first instance to the person having the legal capacity to convey the interest acquired. American Oil Co. v. State Highway Board, 122 Vt. 496, 177 A.2d 358 (1962).
    </p>
    <p>
     A condemnation proceeding was in rem, as it lay against the piece of property itself. 1960-62 Op. Atty. Gen. 49.

     It is entirely consistent to construe 19 V.S.A.
     §
     2307(b) to require that municipalities follow 19 V.S.A. ch. 5, which governs condemnation, when taking private lands solely for bicycle routes, but to allow them to proceed under 19 V.S.A. ch. 7, which governs laying out, discontinuing, and reclassifying highways, when dominant purpose is laying out of highway, even if bicycle route is part of overall project.

      The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that a property owner receives fair treatment and just compensation when the owner's property is taken for State highway projects, and that condemnation proceedings are conducted expeditiously so that highway projects in the public interest are not unnecessarily delayed.

         1. Business losses.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Although business losses are compensable, Vermont's statutory scheme significantly limits their recovery by compensating for only those losses directly and proximately caused by the physical loss of property. Ehrhart v. Agency of Transportation, 180 Vt. 125, 904 A.2d 1200 (July 14, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the loss of a piece of property results directly in further losses to a business, the owner is entitled to compensation, but when the business loss arises from the rerouting of traffic, and not from the loss of the land itself, no compensation is due. Ehrhart v. Agency of Transportation, 180 Vt. 125, 904 A.2d 1200 (July 14, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that a highway project required the taking of landowners' property did not make all losses resulting from the project, including losses resulting from the placement of the median strip, compensable. Ehrhart v. Agency of Transportation, 180 Vt. 125, 904 A.2d 1200 (July 14, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court in condemnation proceeding did not err in submitting issue of business loss to jury; fact that business was not owned by landowner individually but by family corporation was not determinative, since applicable statutes did not require that landowner own the business as a sole proprietorship in order to recover business loss. Mazza v. Agency of Transportation, 168 Vt. 112, 716 A.2d 817 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Business losses which have not necessarily been compensated for in the allowance made for the land in a condemnation proceeding are recognized as an item of damage, although only with respect to a fixed and established business. Raymond v. Chittenden County Circumferential Highway, 158 Vt. 100, 604 A.2d 1281 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiffs in condemnation proceeding did not meet the requirements for a business loss award, where it was impossible to distinguish business loss from the value of the land because the nature of the business was the sale of the land. Raymond v. Chittenden County Circumferential Highway, 158 Vt. 100, 604 A.2d 1281 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining compensation for taking of property of shopping center owner, which taking consisted of a strip of the parking lot along the road taken to widen the road, evidence of diminution in the value of the remainder property should have been admitted, based on claim that income produced by the use would decline due to loss of parking spaces. In re Condemnation Award to 89-2 Realty, 152 Vt. 426, 566 A.2d 979 (1989).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Where landowner in condemnation proceeding raised claim for business loss of farm as well as for loss of land used in the farm, jury was required to value property for farm use rather than its highest and best use as residential development once it decided to award business loss, and since jury's verdict was supported by evidence it was required to stand. Mazza v. Agency of Transportation, 168 Vt. 112, 716 A.2d 817 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court in condemnation proceeding did not err in refusing to allow jury to award landowner the cost of a new irrigation line, where landowner provided no evidence on how the expense related to fair market value of the remaining land or business. Mazza v. Agency of Transportation, 168 Vt. 112, 716 A.2d 817 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        An owner whose property is taken by condemnation is entitled to the value for the most reasonable use of the property, along with compensation for business loss and the reduced value of any remaining property; value used is fair market value when the land is taken at its highest and best use. Raymond v. Chittenden County Circumferential Highway, 158 Vt. 100, 604 A.2d 1281 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Value for most reasonable use of property in condemnation proceeding must be set on date of condemnation. Raymond v. Chittenden County Circumferential Highway, 158 Vt. 100, 604 A.2d 1281 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Value of 50-acre undeveloped property plaintiff planned to turn into 87-unit housing development was properly set at the condemnation date, when the property was raw and without infrastructure, rather than at various levels of development, since plans not performed on were not compensable. Raymond v. Chittenden County Circumferential Highway, 158 Vt. 100, 604 A.2d 1281 (1992).

       <p>
        In reviewing the grant of a necessity petition under this chapter, the appellate court must accept the findings of the trial court if supported by any competent evidence, and must accept the trial court's decision unless there is an abuse of that court's discretion. Rossetti v. Chittenden County Transportation Authority, 165 Vt. 61, 674 A.2d 1284 (1996).

       <p>
        On the issue of damages available to the property owner in cases involving condemnation by solid waste management districts, the governing statute is identical to that for condemnation generally. Thus, preexisting case law on damages is available in a proceeding for condemnation of a sand pit to create a solid waste landfill. In re Chittenden Solid Waste District, 182 Vt. 38, 928 A.2d 1183 (April 20, 2007).

       </h5>
       <p>
        In an eminent domain proceeding, the trial court properly excluded evidence relating to other land sales to the condemning agency. The owners of the other parcel faced the possibility of condemnation at the time of the sales, which were facially quite unusual and which cut off the property in question from access to a highway; the evidence was marginally probative and quite confusing. Harrington v. Vermont Agency of Transportation, 185 Vt. 617, 971 A.2d 658 (mem.) (2009).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The "necessity" required for the State to take land and rights of others for highway construction did not mean an absolute or imperative necessity but only that the taking have been reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of the end in view under the particular circumstances. Agency of Transportation v. Wall Management, 144 Vt. 640, 481 A.2d 1270 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        The "necessity" required for laying out a public road did not mean an imperative, indispensable or absolute necessity but only that the taking have been reasonably necessary to the accomplishment of the end in view under the particular circumstances. Cersosimo v. Town of Townshend, 139 Vt. 594, 431 A.2d 496 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Implicit in the use of the term "necessity" was the need or necessity for the highway itself, as well as the necessity that particular parcels of land were required for the construction of the highway. State Transportation Board v. May, 137 Vt. 320, 403 A.2d 267 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Necessity did not mean an imperative or indispensable or absolute necessity but only that the taking provided for have been reasonably necessary for the accomplishment of the end in view under the particular circumstances. Latchis v. State Highway Board, 120 Vt. 120, 134 A.2d 191 (1957).

       <p>

    The Agency, when in its judgment the interests of the State require, may take any property necessary to lay out, relocate, alter, construct, reconstruct, maintain, repair, widen, grade, or improve any State highway, including affected portions of town highways.

       § 507. Cattle passes.
       <br />
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      In its order of condemnation, the court may direct the Agency to install passes under the highway for the benefit of large modern farm properties, the fee title of which is owned by any party to the proceedings, where a reasonable need is shown by the owner. The court may consider evidence relative to present and anticipated future highway traffic volume, future land development in the area, and the amount and type of acreage separated by the highway in determining the need for an underpass of larger dimensions than a standard cattle pass of reinforced concrete, metal, or other suitable material that provides usable dimensions five feet wide by six feet three inches high. Where a herd of greater than 50 milking cows is consistently maintained on the property, the court may direct that the dimensions of the larger underpass shall be eight feet in width and six feet three inches in height to be constructed of reinforced concrete, and the owner of the farm property shall pay one-fourth of the difference in overall cost between the standard cattle pass and the larger underpass. Where the owner of the farm property desires an underpass of dimensions greater than eight feet in width and six feet three inches in height, the underpass may be constructed if feasible and in accordance with acceptable design standards, and the total additional costs over the dimensions specified shall be paid by the owner. The provisions of this section shall not be interpreted to prohibit the Agency and the property owner from determining the specifications of a cattle pass or underpass by mutual agreement at any time, either prior or subsequent to the date of the court's order. The owner of a fee title shall be interpreted to include lessees of so-called lease land.

        Provision of subsec. (b) of this section authorizing Superior Court to require installation of a cattle underpass is intended to benefit owners of farms by fully subsidizing the cost of standard underpasses and partially subsidizing the cost of larger ones.

        In determining whether the necessity of the State required the taking of land and rights of others for highway construction, the court was not required to look into the cost of utility relocation, since such costs did not directly accrue from the taking of the property.

        The definition of necessity required for the State to take land and rights of others for highway construction gave the State Highway Board broad discretion in determining what land it deemed necessary for the particular location and route to be followed, and a court would not interfere with that determination as long as it was made in good faith and was not capricious.

        A broad discretion had been vested in the State Transportation Board in determining what land was necessary for the location and route to be followed, and its determination would not be interfered with by the courts if made in good faith and not capricious or wantonly injurious.

        At a hearing on the necessity for taking of land for construction of an interchange for a limited-access four-lane highway, the court was at liberty to accept testimony on the issue of public safety. State Highway Board v. Pratt, 127 Vt. 385, 250 A.2d 726 (1969).

        At a hearing on the necessity for the taking of land by the State Highway Board, since the court was without authority to consider a route proposed by the appellants as a feasible alternate to the route proposed by the State Highway Board, the evidence relating thereto was properly excluded. State Highway Board v. Shepard, 127 Vt. 525, 253 A.2d 155 (1969).

        .
       </h5>
       <p>
        In highway condemnation cases the landowner was entitled to compensation that measured the difference between the fair market value of the entire tract before the taking and the fair market value of the residue after the appropriation. Dunn v. State Highway Board, 135 Vt. 26, 370 A.2d 626 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        In placing a value upon property taken by eminent domain and property injured by the taking, the use to which the property was actually put was to be considered as one of its reasonable uses, and such use could qualify as the most reasonable use if it gave the property a higher value than any other use. Batchelder v. State Highway Board, 130 Vt. 263, 291 A.2d 257 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Just compensation for property taken was construed as reimbursement of the fair market value of the property, plus damage suffered by the remainder. Crawford v. State Highway Board, 130 Vt. 18, 285 A.2d 760 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the property taken was at a valuable business site, its suitability for business use, as evidenced by testimony relating to the business success generated by its location, was properly introduced as a factor in determining its fair market value. Crawford v. State Highway Board, 130 Vt. 18, 285 A.2d 760 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Overall, the general verdict in a condemnation proceeding was to reflect the market value rule that the landowner was entitled to the most reasonable use value of the parcel taken, together with the difference in the value of the land remaining, taking value immediately before and immediately after the taking. Thorburn v. State Highway Board, 130 Vt. 11, 285 A.2d 755 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no hard and fast rule applicable to every case as to what elements properly entered into consideration in determining the market value of condemned property. Allen v. Burlington Housing Authority, 129 Vt. 8, 270 A.2d 588 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a condemnation proceeding the landowner was entitled to the value of the parcel appropriated, together with the difference in the fair market value of the remaining property immediately before and after the taking. Children's Home, Inc. v. State Highway Board, 125 Vt. 93, 211 A.2d 257 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        Structural improvements on the land might contribute to the total value of property taken or might add little or nothing to value; depending upon whether such improvements were adapted to the use from which the land taken derived its principal worth. Smith v. State Highway Board, 125 Vt. 54, 209 A.2d 495 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        In condemnation proceedings, the existence of known mineral deposits could be of value and a proper factor to be considered in arriving at the true market worth of the parent property before and after condemnation. Farr v. State Highway Board, 123 Vt. 334, 189 A.2d 542 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where land was condemned that was a part of separate parcels of real estate constituting one enterprise, the mutually dependent elements thereof were in the eye of the law a single parcel and were to be so treated in assessing damages. Spear v. State Highway Board, 122 Vt. 406, 175 A.2d 511 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no exact formula that was available for the taking of property by eminent domain; in its broadest terms, the law measured damages by the market value rule, and awarded the landowner the difference between the fair market value of entire tract before taking and its fair market value immediately after taking. Rome v. State Highway Board, 121 Vt. 253, 154 A.2d 604 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        Care was to be exercised in applying market value rules in ascertaining damages for the taking of land for highway purposes because there were many injuries resulting from the opening of streets and roads for which landowners could not receive compensation, so that allowance for such injuries in determining the market value of land remaining after part of a parcel had been taken for a road would not be correct in law. Nelson v. State Highway Board, 110 Vt. 44, 1 A.2d 689 (1938).

        Property owners were entitled to compensation for damages, which could include business losses, resulting from the taking or use of their property for highway purposes. Sand Bar Corp. v. State Transportation Board, 145 Vt. 362, 488 A.2d 442 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right of property owners to compensation for business losses resulting from the taking of their property for highway purposes, related business loss to property taken, not to highway relocation. Sand Bar Corp. v. State Transportation Board, 145 Vt. 362, 488 A.2d 442 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Business loss suffered as a result of highway relocation was not compensable. Sand Bar Corp. v. State Transportation Board, 145 Vt. 362, 488 A.2d 442 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the evidence relating to the reduction in value of the property remaining embraced all of the losses to the business claimed, there was no proper place for separate business loss damages. Young v. State Highway Board, 130 Vt. 222, 290 A.2d 29 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Total destruction of the business was not a prerequisite to an award for business loss. Gibson Estate v. State Highway Board, 128 Vt. 47, 258 A.2d 810 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        The problem in each case of assessing business loss was essentially factual. Fiske v. State Highway Board, 124 Vt. 87, 197 A.2d 790 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was the intention to compensate for loss of fixed and established business was so inextricably related and connected with the land where it was located that an appropriation of the land meant an appropriation of the business. O'Brien v. State Highway Board, 123 Vt. 414, 190 A.2d 699 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Business loss could be considered on the issue of damages where a business was inextricably related to property on which it was carried on so that taking resulted in subjecting the business to a loss that would not be compensated for by paying for the value of land alone. Colson v. State Highway Board, 122 Vt. 392, 173 A.2d 849 (1961), overruled on other grounds, Pidgeon v. Vermont State Transportation Board (1987) 147 Vt. 578, 522 A.2d 244.
       </p>
       <p>
        The market value rule was modified by recognizing that in some instances a business enterprise might be invaded and yield of business lessened or destroyed as a result of the taking of land upon which a business was situated. Record v. State Highway Board, 121 Vt. 230, 154 A.2d 475 (1959).

        Value enhanced for commercial purposes by increased traffic, and a rise in market value due to easy accessibility, were substantially the same in cause and effect. Smith v. State Highway Board, 128 Vt. 336, 262 A.2d 486 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        In fixing compensation for condemned land, special benefits were to be differentiated by their nature or kind rather than by their degree or amount. Farrell v. State Highway Board, 123 Vt. 453, 194 A.2d 410 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether a given benefit conferred by the public improvement of condemned land was general or special was to be determined largely by the circumstances of the particular case and special benefits were to be differentiated from general benefits by their nature or kind rather than by their degree or amount, and benefits did not cease to be general merely because benefits to the property in question were greater in degree than to property of some of other owners. Howe v. State Highway Board, 123 Vt. 278, 187 A.2d 342 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was only when landowner had directly received special benefit to his remaining land, as distinguished from general public benefit, that damage going to him was reduced. Howe v. State Highway Board, 123 Vt. 278, 187 A.2d 342 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Potentially increased flow of traffic by reason of highway relocation was not to be regarded as a special benefit. Howe v. State Highway Board, 123 Vt. 278, 187 A.2d 342 (1963).

       </p>
       <p>
        The loss of surface water, which had flowed into a municipal water shed from lands owned by others and taken for highway purposes, was not a compensable loss in condemnation proceeding. City of Winooski v. State Highway Board, 124 Vt. 496, 207 A.2d 255 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        The loss of an access road constructed by a municipality on lands taken was not compensable where the road was a public road constructed by the municipality in its governmental capacity as distinguished from its proprietary function.

        A general estimate of damage given by a competent witness for the State Transportation Board was sufficient to support a finding of damages for land taken to build a highway safety arrester bed for runaway trucks.

       <p>
        The admission of a photograph showing the building condemned, with its windows boarded, and also showing a building next to the condemned building, offered by the condemnor to show the surrounding neighborhood, did not prejudice the condemnee. Allen v. Burlington Housing Authority, 129 Vt. 8, 270 A.2d 588 (1970).
       </p>

        When in addition to tree cutting along a half-mile section of a road, a town made some improvements to the ditching, brought in 164 dump-truck loads of gravel, and widened a portion of the road, without any blasting or installation of culverts, these changes qualified as maintenance and did not add up to an alteration.

       <p>
        When the statute pertaining to definitions and the statute governing petitions to lay out highways are read together, it is evident that the right to appeal belongs to those who own or have a legal interest in property through which the highway is laid out. The fact that "interested in" is defined as having a legal interest in the property "affected" does not change that the appeal right belongs only to those with an interest in property "through which" the highway is laid out.

       <p>
        Town's argument that trial court hearing an appeal of selectmen's denial of reclassification of town highway petition could not order reclassification of road without finding that town acted discriminatorily or arbitrarily in refusing reclassification was rejected since a finding of discrimination is not a prerequisite to reclassification by the Superior Court, and statutory amendment states that a class 4 highway need not be reclassified to class 3 because there exists one or more class 3 highways with characteristics similar to the class 4 highway.

       </p>
       <p>
        Because highway was laid through two or more towns, New Haven town selectboard lacked jurisdiction when it attempted to discontinue its portion of highway in 1926; selectboard's failure to comply with then-existing statutory scheme voided its proceedings and its order purporting to discontinue highway segment, and therefore highway was held to still legally exist.

        There is no legal requirement that a town must conduct all necessary maintenance before it can reclassify its roads. The applicable standard for road reclassification is whether the selectboard determines that the public good, necessity, and convenience of the inhabitants of the municipality require reclassification, and whether the selectboard's decision to this effect is supported by any competent evidence.

        In reviewing a town's reclassification of a road by writ of certiorari, the trial court did not err in denying plaintiffs' request to supplement the record on appeal. The statute was silent on the method of review, and the decision was made following a quasi-judicial procedure by the town selectboard in which plaintiffs freely participated. Ketchum v.

        When a town decided to reclassify a town road from a class 3 to a class 4 highway, review was by writ of certiorari under the rule providing for review of governmental action. Ketchum v. Town of Dorset, 190 Vt. 507, 22 A.3d 500 (mem.) (2011).

         3. Reclassification proper.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        There was competent evidence to support a town's decision to reclassify a road from a class 3 and class 4 town highway to a legal trail. The selectboard considered evidence of the significant cost of maintaining the road, the fact that the area had reverted to its natural state after an ineffective reclassification that led the town to stop maintaining the road, the environmental concerns, the minimal importance of the road as a through-road, and the fact that abutting landowners would have access to their parcels. Demarest v. Town of Underhill, 195 Vt. 204, 87 A.3d 439 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Town's decision to reclassify a town road from a class 3 to a class 4 highway was supported by the evidence that the road was too narrow to let two cars pass safely and that the road's steep incline made snow removal unsafe. Ketchum v. Town of Dorset, 190 Vt. 507, 22 A.3d 500 (mem.) (2011).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in denying petitioners' request for a stay of a highway reclassification appeal while a maintenance case was pending. Petitioners did not challenge the town's maintenance decision until long after the deterioration in the road due to the lack of maintenance had actually occurred, there was no legal requirement that the road be brought back to its former condition before the town could undertake reclassification, and it was proper for the town to base its reclassification decision on the conditions then existing instead of those existing in 2001, when a reclassification that was later ruled ineffective caused the town to stop maintaining the road.

       <p>
        After a highway had been laid out by the selectmen and had been made by the town; had been kept in repair and used by the public for some twelve or thirteen years; and the landowner had accepted his land damages for laying out of the road, built his fences beside it, and had acquiesced during all that time in treating it as a public highway, he could not sustain trespass on the freehold against those who went upon the road to repair it upon the ground that the selectmen had never filed with the town clerk a certificate of the opening of the road. Felch v. Gilman, 22 Vt. 38 (1849).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutory proceedings and surveys by selectmen laying out a public highway, without a recorded certificate that the road was open for travel, did not make the road laid out a public highway, and such a road could not become a public highway unless it was recognized as such by some unequivocal act of the town. Blodgett v. Town of Royalton, 14 Vt. 288 (1842); Bacon v. Boston & Maine Railroad, 83 Vt. 421, 76 A. 128 (1910).

       <p>
        Pent roads laid by selectmen were required to be opened by them, and their certificate thereof was to be recorded. Warren v. Bunnell, 11 Vt. 600 (1839).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a new road was established, any town through which it passed could immediately make it, and it then became the duty of the selectmen to open it; when it was opened, they were required to have a certificate thereof to be recorded in the town clerk's office, which recording was the proper evidence of the opening of the road; and until this was done, the owner of the land could lawfully keep it enclosed with a fence.

       When a person owning or interested in lands through which a highway is laid out, altered, or resurveyed by selectboard members objects to the necessity of taking the land, or is dissatisfied with the laying out, altering, or resurveying of the highway, or with the compensation for damages, he or she may appeal, in accordance with Rule 74 of the Vermont Rules of Civil Procedure, to the Superior Court in the same county, or in either county when the highway or bridge is in two counties. Any number of aggrieved persons may join in the appeal. The appeal shall be filed within 30 days after the order of the selectboard members on the highway is recorded. If the appeal is taken from the appraisal of damages only, the selectboard members may proceed with the work as though no appeal had been taken.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Plaintiff coalition, which challenged the necessity determination in the context of a proceeding to lay out a highway, lacked standing to appeal. Because it lacked any legal interest of record in any of the properties affected by defendant city's order, it had no statutory right to appeal and therefore could not invoke Rule 74, governing appeals from decisions of government agencies; furthermore, Rule 75, governing review of governmental action, did not apply because Rule 74 offered a review mechanism. Friends of Pine St. v. City of Burlington, 212 Vt.
    - , 236 A.3d 1241 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the right to appeal from a necessity decision belonged to those who owned or had a legal interest in property through which a highway was laid out, an abutting landowner was not entitled to appeal, as it did not have an interest in any property through which the highway was to be laid out; the fact that the landowner was entitled to notice of the hearing did not confer a right to appeal. Fortieth Burlington v. City of Burlington, - Vt.
    - , 236 A.3d 1236 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the statute pertaining to definitions and the statute governing petitions to lay out highways are read together, it is evident that the right to appeal belongs to those who own or have a legal interest in property through which the highway is laid out. The fact that "interested in" is defined as having a legal interest in the property "affected" does not change that the appeal right belongs only to those with an interest in property "through which" the highway is laid out. Fortieth Burlington v. City of Burlington, - Vt.
    - , 236 A.3d 1236 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plain reading of the statute regarding petitions to Superior Court in cases involving laying out, altering, or resurveying highways reveals that the Superior Court's review is not pursuant to the rule regarding appeals from decisions of government agencies in cases involving reclassification of a class 3 to class 4 road. There is no merit to the argument that "altered" in the statute includes reclassification. Ketchum v. Town of Dorset, 190 Vt. 507, 22 A.3d 500 (mem.) (2011).
       </p>

        Town was not constitutionally required to notify an individual of his or her right to appeal a decision of the board of selectmen following a full hearing regarding the classification of a town road. Gabriel v. Town of Duxbury, 171 Vt. 610, 764 A.2d 1224 (mem.) (2000).

        This section, authorizing a dissatisfied landowner in proceedings for the laying out of a public highway to bring a petition to the county court, and thereon have a rehearing of all questions involved, was a sufficient provision for an appeal as against the objection that the statute was unconstitutional in failing to provide for an appeal to disinterested tribunal.

        The loss of the right to require maintenance and repair of a town highway upon its reduction to the status of a trail was not a loss of a right for which an abutting landowner was entitled to compensation, since such a right was not in the landowner, but rather was held in common by all the citizens and taxpayers of the state, and the abutters could convert the right into an appurtenance of the abutting land subject to compensation. Perrin v. Town of Berlin, 138 Vt. 306, 415 A.2d 221 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the trustees of an incorporated village raised the grade of a highway in front of petitioner's premises, and the selectmen of the town had nothing to do with the filling, though they knew that it was being made, and there was no survey and no record of the alteration, a county court had no power to appoint commissioners to appraise the damages.

       <p>
        Although selectmen are given broad authority over town roads, in reclassification cases the Legislature has placed selectmen in quasi-judicial role to hear classification petitions, with appellate jurisdiction over their action in the Superior Court; the selectmen can adopt reclassification policies to determine their action, but those policies do not bind the Superior Court in exercising its discretionary power in a practical manner, and not by technical rules.

        In reclassification of highway proceedings an appeal from selectmen's decision is made to Superior Court and must be referred to three disinterested commissioners to inquire into the convenience and necessity of the proposal and report to the court; the court may reject or accept the commissioners' report in whole or in part and render an order or decree with respect to the issue before it.

      When a petition is made to the Superior or Supreme Court to discontinue a highway laid out by commissioners appointed by either of the courts, which has not been built agreeably to the orders of the court, the petition shall be served on one or more of the original petitioners for the laying of the highway, as well as on one or more selectboard members of the town or towns through which the highway is laid, or the petition, on motion, shall be dismissed.
    If commissioners are appointed and report adversely to the request of the petition, the original petitioners shall, in the discretion of the court, be entitled to costs.

      The selectboard shall notify the Commissioner of Forests, Parks and Recreation when it has filed a petition to discontinue a highway under this subchapter.
    The selectboard may designate the proposed discontinued highway as a trail, in which case the right-of-way shall be continued at the same width.
    The Commissioner of Forests, Parks and Recreation with the approval of the selectboard may also make this designation.
    If the discontinued highway is not designated as a trail, the right-of-way shall belong to the owners of the adjoining lands.
    If it is located between the lands of two different owners, it shall be returned to the lots to which it originally belonged, if they can be determined; if not, it shall be equally divided between the owners of the lands on each side.

         Erection over a street of an elevated viaduct, intended for general public travel, constituted a change of grade. Menut & Parks Co. v. Village of St. Johnsbury, 114 Vt. 41, 39 A.2d 342 (1944).
        </p>
        <p>
         The statute did not apply to the acts of successive officers, and one ordinary repair could not be added to another and make the result an alteration; to establish liability under the statute, the changes complained of must have been made at one time or according to a fixed plan.

         Alteration in the roadbed of a highway began when the lowering or raising of the roadbed exceeded three feet, a change of not more than three feet being regarded as ordinary repairs, and not as alteration of the highway. Collins v. City of Barre, 91 Vt. 343, 101 A. 43 (1917).

         Without compliance with the provision for notice to the owners of property abutting a highway of proposed alteration therein by cutting down or raising the roadbed more than three feet, the action of the board of street commissioners in regard to such alteration was without jurisdiction and void so far as the owners of the property in question were concerned, and the record of doings of the commissioners was not constructive notice to subsequent purchaser of property.

      When a highway or bridge is out of repair or unsafe for travel, any three citizens or taxpayers in the State may give written and signed notice of the insufficiency to the selectboard of the town in which the highway or bridge is situated, setting forth in general terms the location of the highway or bridge and the nature of the insufficiency.
    If the town neglects for 72 hours to respond by either denying the allegation or to commence work upon the highway or bridge, or fails to continue the work in good faith and with reasonable dispatch until the highway or bridge is put in good and sufficient repair, the citizens may file with one of the county road commissioners or the Superior Court for the county in which the highway or bridge is situated a written complaint, signed and sworn to, setting forth in general terms the location of the highway or bridge and the nature of the insufficiency.
    The complainants shall also give the commissioners security by deposit or otherwise for the costs of proceedings under the complaint.

        In proceedings to order repairs upon defective highways, the county road commissioners constituted an inferior tribunal, having quasi-judicial powers. Town of Springfield v. Newton, 115 Vt. 39, 50 A.2d 605 (1947).

        A tile drain traversing a public highway beneath its surface and consisting of an opening or channel through which water flowed was a "culvert" within the meaning of the statute for such a structure was certainly a "sluice," and "culvert" included "sluice."

       </p>
       <p>
        A hole in a highway at a point five rods distant from a culvert, occasioned by the fact that the culvert was not large enough to carry off water, was not a defect in a bridge, sluice or culvert for which a town was responsible to a person injured thereby.

        An abutment to a bridge was part of the bridge, and when a declaration alleged an injury occasioned by the insufficiency of a bridge, and the proof was that the defect and insufficiency was in the abutment, this was not such a variance as to be ground for reversing judgment.

        In statutory actions for injury resulting from a defective culvert, the cause of the injury must have arisen at the defective culvert or bridge sought to be charged. Thompson v. Town of Stannard, 125 Vt. 140, 211 A.2d 253 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        A town was not liable for damages sustained by an individual on account of insufficiency and want of repair of a highway or bridge unless such damage was direct, and the insufficiency or want of repair was the proximate cause of the injury; therefore, if a town neglected for an unreasonable time to rebuild a bridge, they would not, on that account, be liable for an injury which was not a proximate or immediate, but only remote, result of the want of a bridge.

        This section requires written notice within 20 days to a town selectman stating the time when and the place where the injury was received, and pointing out in what respect the bridge or culvert was insufficient or out of repair; where personal injury occurs, the claimant must state so pursuant to 19 V.S.A.

        If a load did not exceed the maximum specified, a town was responsible for all damages arising from the insufficiency of its highways, but if the load exceeded that weight, however insufficient the highway might have been, or whatever the degree of care and prudence exercised might have been and however directly the injury might have resulted from the insufficiency of the road, no action whatever could be sustained against the town.

       <p>
        Read together, 19 V.S.A.
        §§

       <p>
        Notice to the selectmen of a claim for injuries from a defective bridge or culvert was not a declaration of a cause of action, need not have been referred to in the declaration, and was not evidence in favor of the plaintiff of matters alleged therein. Castle v. Town of Guilford, 86 Vt. 540, 86 A. 804 (1913).

        The notice required could be accomplished by service on the selectmen of the town within the period prescribed. Thompson v. Town of Stannard, 125 Vt. 140, 211 A.2d 253 (1965).

        Notice of injury to all towns in which a bridge was situated was sufficient to bind all. Tyler v. Williston, 62 Vt. 269, 20 A. 304 (1890).

       <p>
        If notice of an injury and a claim for damages was not given to all of the towns in which a bridge was situated, none were liable. Brown v. Town of Fair Haven, 47 Vt. 386 (1875).

        The requirements of notice were satisfied if the notice fairly gave the selectmen to understand that the bridge or culvert complained of was one which their town was liable to keep in repair. Cushman v. Town of Bristol, 112 Vt. 60, 20 A.2d 110 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        The notice need not have stated that the bridge described was one for the care and maintenance of which the defendant town had responsibility. Castle v. Town of Guilford, 86 Vt. 540, 86 A. 804 (1913); Cushman v. Town of Bristol, 112 Vt. 60, 20 A.2d 110 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        A notice addressed to designated persons as the selectmen of the specified town, which stated that plaintiff "while traveling on the public highway in your town" was injured, sufficiently located the place of injury as on a highway in that town. Graves v. Town of Waitsfield, 81 Vt. 84, 69 A. 137 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the notice fairly informed the selectmen that the highway about which the complaint was made was in their town, it sufficiently informed them that it was also a highway which the town was required by law to keep in repair. Skinner v. Town of Weathersfield, 78 Vt. 410, 63 A. 142 (1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a notice that recited that the culvert complained of was located "about 10 rods" south of the junction of designated highways, and it appeared that the defective culvert was 41 rods south of that junction, the recited distance was not controlling, and the notice sufficiently designated the location of the culvert. Clement National Bank v. Connelly, 88 Vt. 55, 90 A. 794 (1914).
       </p>
       <p>
        A notice was sufficient where the selectmen, with the notice in hand, could have found the place without difficulty. Tinkham v. Town of Stockbridge, 64 Vt. 480, 24 A. 761 (1892).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the plaintiff, based upon his acquaintance with the locality, gave as accurate and definite a location of the place of injury as was practical for him to do, the notice was sufficient. Melendy v. Town of Bradford, 56 Vt. 148 (1883).
       </p>
       <p>
        A notice was insufficient as to the place of the accident where indefinite expressions, such as "a few rods," were used when exact distances from prominent objects could have been given. Butts v. Town of Stowe, 53 Vt. 600 (1880).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the notice of injury designated the place of the accident as between two points named, which were a mile or more apart, and the plaintiff was well acquainted with the highway and knew of several objects by which he could have definitely described the place of injury, the notice was insufficient. Bean v. Town of Concord, 48 Vt. 30 (1875).
       </p>
       <p>
        A notice that read "I am under the necessity of calling your attention to an accident that happened on the Green River road on Friday, the 22d inst., in consequence of a defect in the highway. My wife was thrown into Green River, and badly hurt, besides breaking the sleigh . . . ." did not sufficiently state the place where the injury was received. Babcock v. Town of Guilford, 47 Vt. 519 (1875).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a notice omitted the place where the injury was sustained, it was error for the court to allow the plaintiff to show it by parol. Underhill v. Town of Washington, 46 Vt. 767 (1874).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the distance between two places on a highway mentioned in the notice was four and one-half miles, the notice was too indefinite as to the place of the accident. Law v. Town of Fairfield, 46 Vt. 425 (1874).

        A notice to the selectmen stating that for want of proper and sufficient guard on a bridge and the abutment and approaches thereof, plaintiff's horses fell over the abutment, and that the bridge and approaches were wholly insufficient and out of repair in that there was no sufficient guard to protect the team from slipping off the approaches, sufficiently alleged the insufficiency of the bridge. Castle v. Town of Guildford, 86 Vt. 540, 86 A. 804 (1913).
       </p>
       <p>
        A notice that an accident happened on the approach to a bridge spanning a designated stream and that described the approach as narrow, with an embankment on the side where the accident occurred, and without sufficient protection to keep teams from going off on that side, sufficiently met the requirement that the notice point out in what respect the bridge or culvert was insufficient or out of repair. Graves v. Town of Waitsfield, 81 Vt. 84, 69 A. 137 (1908).

        In an action against a town for injury to a traveler because of a defective culvert, it was not essential that the declaration allege the giving of written notice of the claim as required by the statute in order to render admissible the giving of the notice. Herrick v. Town of Holland, 83 Vt. 502, 77 A. 6 (1910).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action against a town for damages, the plaintiff was not required to aver in his declaration that he gave notice to the selectmen of such town of the injury and his intention to claim satisfaction therefor, such being no part of the cause of action, but pertaining merely to the remedy and evidence.

        The provision that no action could be maintained against a town for injuries or damage sustained because of an insufficiency of a bridge or culvert unless the prescribed written notice was given to the selectmen pertained to the remedy, and no such action could be maintained without proof of the required notice.

       </p>
       <p>
        In an action against a town for injuries resulting from an insufficiency of a bridge or culvert, the written notice that was given could be prima facie sufficient, and yet could be shown by evidence to be doubtful, or even insufficient; therefore, the fact that the notice, when offered in evidence, was received without objection did not constitute a waiver of material defects therein, nor of the town's right to take advantage of such defects when shown in the course of the trial.

        There could be no absolute rule of law as to how long one must have been bereft of his reason in consequence of an injury upon a highway in order to make it unnecessary for him to give notice to a town, and if, after the primary effects of the injury had passed and the physical system had had time and opportunity to resume its natural condition, the person was still left in a state of insanity or insensibility, or was otherwise deprived of his reason, and the condition was fixed in its character, then, although his reason might return in a longer or shorter time and did return within the statutory period for giving notice, the fact was established that, in consequence of injury, he was bereft of his reason and excused from giving notice.

       <p>
        A notice describing injuries as "a severe cut and bruise on the back of my head, and my head otherwise injured. My left hip was bruised and made sore and lame. I was hurt and made lame through my chest and bowels . . . ." fulfilled the requirement that the notice state the part of the body injured, with the extent and effect of the injury on the health of person injured, as the statute did not require the person injured to give an accurate diagnosis of his bodily injuries, but only to describe them and give his understanding of their character. Graves v. Town of Waitsfield, 81 Vt. 84, 69 A. 137 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        A notice reading "the back of my head was injured by striking thereon, with resultant shock, and in consequence of said injuries have been unable to labor" was sufficiently definite to make admissible testimony that the plaintiff's head was bloody and bruised and that, from the time of the alleged injury to the time of trial, the plaintiff had been subject to headaches.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The notice a town historically received of a defective bridge under this section, along with the pleading, likely contained the only information concerning the accident the town would receive before trial and earlier courts, accordingly, required such notice to be highly detailed to allow the town to investigate the claim and prepare defenses; however, as a result of discovery rules that mandate disclosure and allow access to pretrial information, modern pleadings require less specificity. Lane v. Town of Grafton, 166 Vt. 148, 689 A.2d 455 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        In view of a town's receipt of notice within 20 days of an accident that a claimant has suffered personal injuries on a town bridge and its ability to subsequently obtain pretrial information through discovery, the notice was adequate even with a less specific statement of injury. Lane v. Town of Grafton, 166 Vt. 148, 689 A.2d 455 (1997).

        Read together, 19 V.S.A.
        §§
        987 and 988 indicate that notice serves two purposes: (1) to alert towns of bridge conditions endangering public safety so they may be promptly repaired; and (2) to inform towns of impending claims so that there may be timely investigation thereof.

        19 V.S.A.
        §
        987 requires written notice within 20 days to a town selectman stating the time when and the place where the injury was received, and pointing out in what respect the bridge or culvert was insufficient or out of repair; where personal injury occurs, the claimant must state so pursuant to this section.

        Plaintiff's notice was adequate to alert the town that a bridge was dangerous and inform it of a pending claim, thereby allowing the town to begin investigation where, nine days after the accident, plaintiff sent a letter notifying the town of the location of the bridge where the accident occurred and the date of the accident, and the letter informed the town that
    plaintiff had suffered personal injuries along with property damage and that he was making a claim for his damages. Lane v. Town of Grafton, 166 Vt. 148, 689 A.2d 455 (1997).

         Permits must be obtained by anyone or any corporation wishing to use as described in this section any part of the highway right-of-way on either the State or town system. Notwithstanding any other statutory requirement, a permit shall be required for any use of any highway right-of-way, consistent with the provisions of this section. In issuing a permit under this section for a use of a State highway right-of-way, the Secretary may require a transportation impact fee in accordance with 10 V.S.A. chapter 151, subchapter 5.

However, a utility shall not be liable for such damages if its failure to move or adjust the line or facility is for reasons beyond its control, including: emergency restoration activities; inclement weather; timing restrictions imposed by law or permits; terms of collective bargaining agreements; or the failure of another utility to complete its assigned responsibilities for the installation, transfer, or retirement of its facilities. If the Agency or the selectboard cannot agree with a utility as to whether the utility is liable or as to the amount of damages under this subdivision (a)(3), the Agency or selectboard may bring an action in accordance with subsection (h) of this section.

The Agency shall impose reasonable conditions to reduce the number of accesses that will be required for the tract of land. These conditions may include one or more of the following: a required setback of any construction or improvements from the highway to permit the construction of frontage road or roads; acceleration and deceleration lanes; or other areas for off-highway control and management of vehicles and may require reimbursement for any costs to the State for the installation of traffic control devices or road improvements reasonably required because of the development, and may permit or require integration of the access and on-site traffic control facilities and connection of frontage roads between contiguous tracts of land as development is occurring or may occur along the highway.

The selectboard shall have the same authority for town highways. The court may issue temporary or permanent injunctions without bond, and any other relief as may be necessary and appropriate for abatement of any violation. An action, injunction, or other enforcement proceeding by a municipality relating to the failure to obtain or comply with the terms and conditions of any permit issued by a municipality pursuant to this section shall be instituted within 15 years from the date the alleged violation first occurred and not thereafter.

       <p>
        Statutes governing "Utility Relocations in Connection with Certain Highway Projects" are silent as to the permissible sources of city funds. In light of the charter's express grant of authority to the City of Burlington to charge just and reasonable sums for the purpose of erecting and maintaining any poles, wires or any other apparatus in or under the surface of city streets, the statutes do not prohibit the City from requiring a utility to pay the City's statutory share of the differential costs. City of Burlington v. Fairpoint Communs., 186 Vt. 332, 980 A.2d 226 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        City of Burlington had the power to impose "undergrounding" costs on a utility under a valid ordinance enacted pursuant to the charter; thus, the charter, which was the most specific legislative enactment governing the question, would be given effect, along with the ordinance promulgated pursuant to the charter. The statutory provisions upon which the utility relied, the statute regarding lines of wires along highways and the statutes governing "Utility Relocations in Connection with Certain Highway Projects," were less specific and, to the extent they could be read as conflicting with the charter, had to yield to it. City of Burlington v. Fairpoint Communs., 186 Vt. 332, 980 A.2d 226 (2009).

     <p>
      For the purposes of this chapter, a "limited access facility” is defined as a highway or street over, from, or to which owners, or occupants of abutting land, or any other person have no right or easement, or only a limited right or easement, of access, light, air, or view by reason of the fact that their property abuts upon the limited access facility or for any other reason.

       The Agency, with the approval of the Governor, and when appropriate in cooperation with any federal, State, provincial, or local agency, or any other state or province having authority to participate in the construction and maintenance of highways, may plan, designate, establish, vacate, alter, improve, maintain, and provide limited access facilities for public use wherever the Agency, with the approval of the Governor, decides that the protection of existing businesses or traffic conditions, present or future, will justify the special facilities. To the extent not preempted by the Traffic Committee's exercise of authority under 23 V.S.A. §
    1004, the Agency may regulate limited access facilities. However, within cities and villages the Agency's authority under this section shall be subject to such municipal consent as may be provided by law. Town highways may be designated as limited access using this title after approval of the selectboard.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c17s1703ol1b">
       The Agency and the Board shall have, relative to limited access facilities, the same authority as they may at any time have relative to other highways within their jurisdiction.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c17s1703ol1c">
       The Agency, with the approval of the Governor, may also make reasonable rules consistent with this title for the installation, construction, maintenance, repair, renewal, relocation, and removal of tracks, pipes, mains, conduits, cables, wires, towers, poles, and other equipment and appliances, called "public utility equipment," of any public utility within any limited access facility.
      </li>
      <li id="t19c17s1703ol1d">
       Whenever the Agency determines that it is necessary that any public utility equipment located within any limited access facility should be relocated in the limited access facility or removed from the facility, the public utility owning or operating the equipment shall relocate or remove it in accordance with the order of the Agency.
    The cost and expenses of the relocation or removal, including the cost of installing reused or new equipment in a new location or new locations, and the cost of any lands, or any rights or interests in lands, and any other rights, acquired to accomplish the relocation or removal, shall be determined by the Agency and paid as part of the cost of the limited access facility.
    The public utility may appeal the Agency's cost determination to the Board.
    The public utility owning or operating equipment that has been relocated or removed, or its successors or assigns, may maintain and operate the equipment, with the necessary appurtenances, in the new location or new locations, for as long a period and upon the same terms and conditions, as it had the right to maintain and operate the equipment in its former location.
    No utility may establish its lines or properties within the right-of-way of a limited access facility, except upon the conditions and terms prescribed by the Agency.

Notice of the date, time, and place of the public hearing shall be given to the Secretary of Transportation, the legislative body of the municipality, the municipal planning commission, the regional planning commission, and the Agency of Natural Resources and shall be published in a newspaper having general circulation in the municipality in which the limited access facility lies.

In the Agency's discretion, the request for proposals may provide for a process, including the establishment of a team to review proposals, for the Agency to review conceptual technical elements of each proposal before full proposal submittal for the purposes of identifying defects that would cause rejection of the proposal as nonresponsive. All such conceptual submittals and responses shall be confidential until award of the contract. The request for proposals may also provide for a stipend upon specified terms to unsuccessful proposers that submit proposals conforming to all request-for-proposals requirements.

      Hubbard v. Bolieau,
      144 Vt. 373 (1984), which draws upon established principles of Vermont law.
    This chapter will only apply to resolve conflicts regarding maintenance of private roads in the absence of an express agreement or requirement.
    The provisions of this chapter are not intended to abridge, enlarge, or modify any right provided under
      Hubbard
      and the common law of Vermont.

       <p>
        There was no merit to the argument of the owners of "large lots" within a residential subdivision that they received no benefit from the roads and thus should not have to contribute. The homeowners clearly received an ongoing benefit from the homeowners' association's road maintenance and their continuing right to access their own property; given the benefit they received, it was equitable, and consistent with statute, for them to contribute to maintenance of the road network within the development whether they used all the roads or not.
