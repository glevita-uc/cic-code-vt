         1. Access to records.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Notwithstanding the general right of access to public records under the Public Records Act, the more specific and exacting legislative requirements that a retiring governor's official correspondence be placed in the state archives and that such records be made "accessible only in accord with" the special terms or conditions restricting their use, must control. The statutes, in short, evince an express legislative intent to authorize the "special term" restricting access to a former governor's archived records. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. State, 179 Vt. 214, 892 A.2d 191 (November 4, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislative history supports the conclusion that one purpose of the Archives Act was to codify the secretary of state's longstanding practice - separate and apart from any limitations contained in the Public Records Act - of accepting retiring governors' official papers with broad restrictions on public access for periods of years. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. State, 179 Vt. 214, 892 A.2d 191 (November 4, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court erred in invalidating the special term of the memorandum of understanding restricting access to designated portions of the former governor's official correspondence in the State archives. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. State, 179 Vt. 214, 892 A.2d 191 (November 4, 2005).

       <p>
        Notwithstanding the general right of access to public records under the Public Records Act, the more specific and exacting legislative requirements that a retiring governor's official correspondence be placed in the state archives and that such records be made "accessible only in accord with" the special terms or conditions restricting their use, must control. The statutes, in short, evince an express legislative intent to authorize the "special term" restricting access to a former governor's archived records. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. State, 179 Vt. 214, 892 A.2d 191 (November 4, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislative history supports the conclusion that one purpose of the Archives Act was to codify the secretary of state's longstanding practice-separate and apart from any limitations contained in the Public Records Act -of accepting retiring governors' official papers with broad restrictions on public access for periods of years. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. State, 179 Vt. 214, 892 A.2d 191 (November 4, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court erred in invalidating the special term of the memorandum of understanding restricting access to designated portions of the former governor's official correspondence in the State archives. Judicial Watch, Inc. v. State, 179 Vt. 214, 892 A.2d 191 (November 4, 2005).

        Fact that Legislature amended statute governing professional conduct boards, so as to include power to deny a request for withdrawal of a license application, did not demonstrate that such power had previously been lacking, because legislation containing amendment was enacted to reinstate former policy and was intended to clarify rather than change existing law.

        Professional discipline process should not be used as a pretext, a substitute for, or alternative to, employment laws that define and enforce the rights of employers and employees. Simply put, being a bad manager - even a temperamental, unpredictable, harsh, and demanding one - might not necessarily constitute unprofessional conduct for the purposes of State disciplinary action against a licensed nursing home administrator. Whittington v. Office of Prof'l Regulation, 195 Vt. 181, 87 A.3d 489 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Pursuant to statutory authority, Vermont has adopted the Administrative Rules for Licensed Midwives, and several of the midwifery rules were implicated in a case seeking immediate summary suspension of a midwife's license to practice midwifery. Each time the midwife violated a midwifery rule, she also committed unprofessional conduct. Devers-Scott v. Office of Professional Regulation, 181 Vt. 248, 918 A.2d 230 (January 12, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        By establishing one standard of proof for all professions and occupations regulated by secretary of state, legislature did not intend to lower an extant burden of proof for nurse licensing actions, but rather intended to avoid inefficiency of administering a patchwork of standards adopted by various boards. In re Smith, 169 Vt. 162, 730 A.2d 605 (1999).

        There was no merit to respondent engineer's contention that unprofessional conduct charges were fundamentally flawed or contrary to public policy when the Office of Professional Regulation decided in its discretion, following an investigation, that charges were warranted and then held a hearing. In re Bombardier, 206 Vt. 450, 182 A.3d 1165 (2018).

        Board of Professional Engineering did not misconstrue the scope of respondent engineer's undertaking, as respondent testified that he agreed to a very broad undertaking. In re Bombardier, 206 Vt. 450, 182 A.3d 1165 (2018).

        Nursing home administrator could not be subjected to professional discipline and penalties based on deficiencies with the nursing home when the administrative law officer did not specifically find that she was responsible for their occurrence, but instead held her liable on the basis that administrators were charged with general administration of the home and were thus responsible for all that occurred there. Whittington v. Office of Prof'l Regulation, 195 Vt. 181, 87 A.3d 489 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        No error was found in the administrative law officer's conclusion that a midwife committed unprofessional conduct by failing to obtain written informed consent forms from her client, either for the home birth or for the special risks associated with a vaginal birth after cesarean. Devers-Scott v. Office of Professional Regulation, 181 Vt. 248, 918 A.2d 230 (January 12, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence of midwife's visit to a client's home in New York, which included taking the client's blood pressure and fetal heart tones, supported the administrative law officer's (ALO's) finding that she practiced midwifery in New York in violation of New York law. Therefore, the ALO did not err in concluding that she violated the statute listing as unprofessional conduct the failure to comply with provisions of federal or state statutes or rules governing the practice of the profession. Devers-Scott v. Office of Professional Regulation, 181 Vt. 248, 918 A.2d 230 (January 12, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Midwife failed in her argument that, because the conditions her client presented were not explicitly listed as triggers for a physician consultation in the midwifery rule, there was no support for the administrative law officer's (ALO) conclusion that she should have consulted a physician. However, the ALO did not conclude that she violated the rule in this instance. Instead, the ALO reasonably concluded that, under the particular circumstances the client presented, the statute pertaining to the failure to practice competently required that a midwife, "in the exercise of caution and in providing competent and safe patient care . . . make the assumption that a full rupture of the amniotic membrane [has] occurred . . . [because t]he risks of making the opposite assumption . . . are simply too high." Devers-Scott v. Office of Professional Regulation, 181 Vt. 248, 918 A.2d 230 (January 12, 2007).

        Mistreatment of staff, patients, or visitors can constitute grounds for discipline if it rises to the level that it threatens the health, safety, and welfare of patients. Thus, a nursing home administrator engaged in professional misconduct by failing to practice competently in that her frequent and public abusive conduct toward staff members affected patient well-being. Whittington v. Office of Prof'l Regulation, 195 Vt. 181, 87 A.3d 489 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        When there were multiple instances in which a nursing home administrator interrupted nurses' medication passes, causing delay, this supported a conclusion that she had engaged in professional misconduct by failing to practice competently. Whittington v. Office of Prof'l Regulation, 195 Vt. 181, 87 A.3d 489 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a nursing home administrator told a psychiatric nurse practitioner to diagnose a violent and agitated resident with bipolar disorder so that the resident would be moved to a psychiatric facility, this supported a conclusion that she engaged in unprofessional conduct by performing services beyond her education and training. Whittington v. Office of Prof'l Regulation, 195 Vt. 181, 87 A.3d 489 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Nursing home administrator's telling a patient that he did not need doctor-recommended care exceeded the scope of her training and qualifications, and supported the conclusion that she had engaged in unprofessional conduct by performing services beyond her education and training. Whittington v. Office of Prof'l Regulation, 195 Vt. 181, 87 A.3d 489 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence that a nursing home administrator interfered with an ombudsman supported a conclusion that she had engaged in professional misconduct by failing to practice competently. Whittington v. Office of Prof'l Regulation, 195 Vt. 181, 87 A.3d 489 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence that a nursing home administrator forced a dying patient on "comfort care" to change clothing against the patient's wishes and had a resident placed in a chair when the resident wished to remain in bed supported a conclusion that she had engaged in professional misconduct by failing to practice competently. Whittington v. Office of Prof'l Regulation, 195 Vt. 181, 87 A.3d 489 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the record not only substantially supported, but virtually compelled, the conclusion that midwife repeatedly engaged in unprofessional conduct and provided substandard care to her patients, and there was ample credible support in the record for the administrative law officer's (ALO's) further conclusion that her approach to the accusations itself raised doubts about her future ability to comply with the midwifery rules, the reach of which she has consistently sought to escape through hypertechnical constructions at odds with the rules' protective purposes, the revocation of midwife's license was an appropriate exercise of the ALO's discretion. Devers-Scott v. Office of Professional Regulation, 181 Vt. 248, 918 A.2d 230 (January 12, 2007).

       <p>
        Attorney for the Office of Professional Regulation (OPR) within the office of the Vermont Secretary of State had the power to appeal from a Board of Nursing decision vacating an earlier consent order suspending appellee from practice, as the State was entitled to appeal from an adverse ruling and the legislature intended that OPR attorneys act for the State in filing and pursuing such appeals. Shaddy v. State Office of Prof'l Regulation, 197 Vt. 625, 112 A.3d 718 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislature intended in its 2003 enactments that Office of Professional Regulation (OPR) attorneys assume the role formerly played by the Attorney General and represent the State of Vermont in such proceedings to discharge the burden imposed by statute. The Vermont Supreme Court construes the statutes in Title 3, Chapter 5, Subchapter 3, with respect to professional regulation and OPR, to embody this power; thus, OPR attorneys represent the State of Vermont and may exercise the State's power to appeal from an adverse decision of a board. Shaddy v. State Office of Prof'l Regulation, 197 Vt. 625, 112 A.3d 718 (2014).

        There was no merit to a dentist's argument that the State was not a party which could appeal a trial court's ruling that vacated a decision of the Board of Dental Examiners. The State, as the prosecuting agency, was plainly a party to the proceedings and as such would have been entitled to pursue an administrative appeal and an appeal to the superior court, and was further entitled to appeal from an adverse ruling by the trial court to the Supreme Court of Vermont.

        Attorney for the Office of Professional Regulation (OPR) within the office of the Vermont Secretary of State had the power to appeal from a Board of Nursing decision vacating an earlier consent order suspending appellee from practice, as the State was entitled to appeal from an adverse ruling and the legislature intended that OPR attorneys act for the State in filing and pursuing such appeals. Shaddy v. State Office of Prof'l Regulation, 197 Vt. 625, 112 A.3d 718 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislature intended in its 2003 enactments that Office of Professional Regulation (OPR) attorneys assume the role formerly played by the Attorney General and represent the State of Vermont in such proceedings to discharge the burden imposed by statute. The Vermont Supreme Court construes the statutes in Title 3, Chapter 5, Subchapter 3, with respect to professional regulation and OPR, to embody this power; thus, OPR attorneys represent the State of Vermont and may exercise the State's power to appeal from an adverse decision of a board.

        Section 361(a) of Title 24, providing that the state's attorneys shall prosecute offenses in behalf of the state, this section, and section 153(a) of this title, providing that the attorney general has supervisory powers over criminal prosecutions and advisory powers with respect to state's attorneys in matters relating to that office, give the two offices at least equal authority to initiate criminal prosecutions. Office of State's Attorney v. Office of Attorney General, 138 Vt. 10, 409 A.2d 599 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a state's attorney decides not to initiate a criminal prosecution, the sovereign power of the state to punish for crimes has not been set in motion in the first instance by an agency of the state authorized to do so, and an equal prosecutorial authority, such as the attorney general, may initiate a criminal prosecution.

        Where attorney general initiated prosecution for driving while intoxicated after state's attorney had declined to do so, the state's attorney had not preempted the field and the attorney general did not supersede, displace, or interfere with the state's attorney's decision, as attorney general was validly exercising his equal prosecutorial authority.

        Section 361(a) of Title 24, providing that the state's attorneys shall prosecute offenses in behalf of the state, section 152 of this title, authorizing the attorney general to represent the state in criminal matters and providing that he shall have the same authority throughout the state as a state's attorney, and this section give the two offices at least equal authority to initiate criminal prosecutions.

       <p>
        Where a state's attorney decides not to initiate a criminal prosecution, the sovereign power of the state to punish for crimes has not been set in motion in the first instance by an agency of the state authorized to do so, and an equal prosecutorial authority, such as the attorney general, may initiate a criminal prosecution.

        Where attorney general initiated prosecution for driving while intoxicated after state's attorney had declined to do so, the state's attorney had not preempted the field and the attorney general did not supersede, displace, or interfere with the state's attorney's decision, as the attorney general was validly exercising his equal prosecutorial authority.

       The Attorney General shall develop and administer an adult court diversion program in all counties. In consultation with diversion programs, the Attorney General shall adopt a policies and procedures manual in compliance with this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t03p01c07s164ol1b">
       The program shall be designed for two purposes:
       <ol>
        <li id="t03p01c07s164ol1b1">
         To assist adults who have been charged with a first or a second misdemeanor or a first nonviolent felony.
        </li>
        <li id="t03p01c07s164ol1b2">
         To assist persons who have been charged with an offense and who have substance abuse or mental health treatment needs regardless of the person's prior criminal history record, except a person charged with a felony offense that is a crime listed in <cite class="vt-code">13 V.S.A. § 5301(7)</cite> shall not be eligible under this section. Persons who have attained 18 years of age who are subject to a petition in the Family Division pursuant to 33 V.S.A. chapters 52 or 52A shall also be eligible under this section. Programming for these persons is intended to support access to appropriate treatment or other resources with the aim of improving the person's health and reducing future adverse involvement in the justice system.

       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t03p01c07s164ol1c">
       The program shall support the operation of diversion programs in local communities through grants of financial assistance to, or contracts for services with, municipalities, private groups, or other local organizations. The Attorney General may require local financial contributions as a condition of receipt of program funding.
      </li>
      <li id="t03p01c07s164ol1d">
       The Office of the Attorney General shall develop program outcomes following the designated State of Vermont performance accountability framework and, in consultation with the Department of State's Attorneys and Sheriffs, the Office of the Defender General, the Center for Crime Victim Services, and the Judiciary, report annually on or before December 1 to the General Assembly on services provided and outcome indicators. As a component of the report required by this subsection, the Attorney General shall include data on diversion program referrals in each county and possible causes of any geographical disparities.
      </li>
      <li id="t03p01c07s164ol1e">
       All adult court diversion programs receiving financial assistance from the Attorney General shall adhere to the following provisions:

         The diversion program shall accept only persons against whom charges have been filed and the court has found probable cause, but are not yet adjudicated. The prosecuting attorney may refer a person to diversion either before or after arraignment and shall notify in writing the diversion program and the court of his or her intention to refer the person to diversion. The matter shall become confidential when notice is provided to the court, except that for persons who are subject to conditions of release imposed pursuant to <cite class="vt-code">13 V.S.A. § 7554</cite> and who are referred to diversion pursuant to subdivision (b)(2) of this section, the matter shall become confidential upon the successful completion of diversion. If a person is charged with a qualifying crime as defined in <cite class="vt-code">13 V.S.A. § 7601(4)(A)</cite> and the crime is a misdemeanor, the prosecutor shall provide the person with the opportunity to participate in the court diversion program unless the prosecutor states on the record at arraignment or a subsequent hearing why a referral to the program would not serve the ends of justice. If the prosecuting attorney refers a case to diversion, the prosecuting attorney may release information to the victim upon a showing of legitimate need and subject to an appropriate protective agreement defining the purpose for which the information is being released and in all other respects maintaining the confidentiality of the information; otherwise, files held by the court, the prosecuting attorney, and the law enforcement agency related to the charges shall be confidential and shall remain confidential unless:

    <cite class="vt-code">2017, No. 61</cite>,
    
     §
    
    1 provides: "(a) The General Assembly finds:
      </p>
      <p>
       "(1) According to numerous studies over many years, pretrial diversion programs result in outcomes for participants that are better than incarceration, including reducing the likelihood that participants commit future crimes and improving substance abuse and mental health outcomes. For example, according to a study of the New York City Jail Diversion Project, 12 months after their offense, offenders who go through a diversion program are less likely to reoffend, spend less time in prison, have received more treatment, and are less likely to suffer drug relapses. In addition, a study in the Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law indicates that diversion programs reduce the amount of time participants spend in jail for future offenses from an average of 173 days to an average of 40 days during the year after the offense. Research also demonstrates that offenders who have participated in diversion programs are better able to find employment.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(2) Diversion programs benefit the criminal justice system by reducing costs and allowing resources to be allocated more efficiently for more serious offenders. According to studies by the Urban Institute and the National Alliance on Mental Illness, diversion programs reduce costs and improve outcomes by allowing offenders with mental illness to receive more appropriate treatment outside the criminal justice system. As reported in the Psychiatric Rehabilitation Journal, diversion programs reduce costs by decreasing the need for and use of hospitalization and crisis services by offenders.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(b) It is the intent of the General Assembly that:
      </p>
      <p>
       "(1) Sec. 2 of this act [which amended this section] result in an increased use of the diversion program throughout the State and a more consistent use of the program between different regions of the State;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(2) the Office of the Attorney General collect data pursuant to 3 V.S.A.
       §
       164(d) on diversion program use, including the effect of this act on use of the program statewide and in particular regions of the State; and
      </p>
      <p>
       "(3) consideration be given to further amending the diversion program statutes before Sec. 2 of this act sunsets on July 1, 2020, if it is determined that Sec. 2 of this act did not produce the intended increases in diversion program usage."

        To determine whether a "specific statutory authority," as those terms are used in 3 V.S.A.
        §
        214, is present requires a two-step inquiry: (1) Does the legislation that creates the authority preclude delegation? (2) If not, can the power to subdelegate be implied from the statutory scheme and the circumstances involved? In re Vermont Marble Co., 162 Vt. 355, 648 A.2d 381 (1994).

       <p>
        As the authority to conduct compensation hearings under section 229 of Title 19 is specifically assigned to the state highway board, and are also quasi-judicial in nature, such authority is not delegable by virtue of the specific provisions of this section. 1966-68 Op. Atty. Gen. 85.

        Supreme court was prepared to accept an implied power to subdelegate specific authority when subdelegation is needed and is, in the overall, consistent with legislative intent; however, supreme court could not allow subdelegation of a "specific statutory authority of the office" as those terms are used in 3 V.S.A.

       The General Assembly finds that public records are essential to the administration of State and local government. Public records contain information that allows government programs to function, provides officials with a basis for making decisions, and ensures continuity with past operations. Public records document the legal responsibilities of government, help protect the rights of citizens, and provide citizens a means of monitoring government programs and measuring the performance of public officials. Public records provide documentation for the functioning of government and for the retrospective analysis of the development of Vermont government and the impact of programs on citizens. Public records in general and archival records in particular need to be systematically managed to preserve their legal, historic, and informational value, to provide ready access to vital information, and to promote the efficient and economical operation of government.

      The Governor may remove any civil officer whose appointment devolves upon the Governor in the first instance, whether appointed by him or her or any of his or her predecessors, with or without the advice and consent of the Senate, and appoint a suitable person to succeed such official, subject to removal in his or her discretion, who shall be sworn and give the bond, if any, required by law.
    Such person, unless sooner removed, shall perform the duties and be entitled to the pay of the person whom he or she succeeds, until March 1 of the next biennial year and until his or her successor is appointed and has qualified.

        The right to notice and hearing under section 102 of Title 7 on removal of member of liquor control board is not based on common law principles and is not guaranteed by any constitutional provision, but is merely what might be termed a gratuity on the part of the legislature.

     <p>
      No department or commission of the State government shall regularly employ an alien.
    However, physicians or other qualified health personnel required to have specialized or graduate training, each of whom has filed a declaration of intention to become a citizen, may be considered as eligible for employment in the absence of a register of qualified applicants for vacancies.
    The Commissioner of Corrections may employ alien physicians in a postgraduate training position for a period not to exceed two years.
    The Secretary of Transportation, as an emergency measure due to a nationwide shortage of engineers may employ not more than 10 qualified aliens, each of whom has filed a declaration to become a citizen; admitted under the Refugee Relief Act of 1953, as amended, or paroled in under the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, for a period not to exceed five years from date of appointment as a State employee, in engineering positions in the Agency of Transportation to expedite the surveying, designing and construction of Vermont highways and bridges. The Department of Development may employ outside the classified service aliens in any office located outside the United States, providing the individuals so employed are citizens of the nation in which the office is located.

         9. Review of Attorney General's certification.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The Attorney General's certification decision approving a contract privatizing work previously done by state employees because it did not violate "the spirit and intent" of the state classification law was plainly discretionary in nature. Therefore, the superior court had jurisdiction to review this decision under only a very limited standard of review to determine whether there had been a clear and arbitrary abuse of authority. Vermont State Employees' Ass'n v. Criminal Justice Training Council, 167 Vt. 191, 704 A.2d 769 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Attorney General did not clearly abuse his discretion in deciding to certify a food-service contract, privatizing work previously done by state employees because it did not violate "the spirit and intent" of the state classification law. The contract was not inconsistent with the historical and fundamental purpose of the civil service and its merit system principles, which is to insulate the state work force from political influence so as to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of state government, particularly considering that the contract was subject to formal competitive bidding.
    Nor was the contract inconsistent with merit principles aimed at ensuring an open and independent state work force. Vermont State Employees' Ass'n v. Criminal Justice Training Council, 167 Vt. 191, 704 A.2d 769 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Absent any constitutional imperative, the Court cannot adopt an objective test for certifying whether a contract privatizing work previously done by state employees is contrary to the merit system, which would be imposing conditions on the Attorney General's legislatively derived power to approve such contracts. However, while privatization as a whole has not undermined the personnel system or its merit principles, definite and specific standards setting forth conditions and requirements for privatization are sorely lacking.
    Given the complex and far-reaching policy implications at stake, the Legislature, not the Court, is in the best position to rectify this situation. Vermont State Employees' Ass'n v. Criminal Justice Training Council, 167 Vt. 191, 704 A.2d 769 (1997).

       <p>
        In a sex discrimination grievance filed by a female police officer, the findings were sufficient to support the Labor Relations Board's ultimate conclusion that grievant faced a hostile work environment. While not a case of outright and blatant discrimination based on gender, hostile environment cases seldom are. They are based upon the accretion of seemingly small incidents - of being criticized more harshly, scrutinized more closely, ridiculed for lack of aggression, or diminished for one's appearance, that in the aggregate create an environment of hostility and discrimination. In re Butler, 166 Vt. 423, 697 A.2d 659 (1997).

       <p>
        In a sex discrimination grievance filed by a female police officer, the Labor Relations Board's disparate treatment analysis was not flawed by the alleged comparison of grievant's conduct to persons and conduct that were not similarly situated, as the test is whether a prudent person, looking objectively at the incidents in question, would think them "roughly equivalent."

        Plain language of the hiring statute, which states that when there is a vacancy in a classified position, the appointing officer shall make a diligent effort to recruit an employee from within the classified service to fill the vacancy, speaks to efforts to "recruit," it does not direct the hiring process. Furthermore, even assuming that the State did not make efforts to recruit, plaintiffs failed to articulate how this had any relevance to the issue of whether the State's decision to give a male employee a higher-than-usual starting salary was justified by legitimate business reasons.

    <cite class="vt-code">2017, No. 169</cite> (Adj. Sess.),
    
     §
    
    1 provides: "The General Assembly finds and declares that:
      </p>
      <p>
       "(1) Our State has a compelling interest in preserving and promoting an open Internet in Vermont.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(2) As Vermont is a rural state with many geographically remote locations, broadband Internet access service is essential for supporting economic and educational opportunities, strengthening health and public safety networks, and reinforcing freedom of expression and democratic, social, and civic engagement.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(3) The accessibility and quality of communications networks in Vermont, specifically broadband Internet access service, will critically impact our State's future.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(4) Net neutrality is an important topic for many Vermonters. Nearly 50,000 comments attributed to Vermonters were submitted to the FCC during the
       Notice of Proposed Rulemaking
       regarding the
       Restoring Internet Freedom Order,
       WC Docket No. 17-108, FCC 17-166. Transparency with respect to the network management practices of ISPs doing business in Vermont will continue to be of great interest to many Vermonters.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(5) In 1996, Congress recognized that '[t]he Internet and other interactive computer services offer a forum for a true diversity of political discourse, unique opportunities for cultural development, and myriad avenues for intellectual activity' and '[i]ncreasingly Americans are relying on interactive media for a variety of political, educational, cultural, and entertainment services.' 47 U.S.C.
       §
       230(a)(3) and (5).
      </p>
      <p>
       "(6) Many Vermonters do not have the ability to choose easily between Internet service providers (ISPs). This lack of a thriving competitive market, particularly in isolated locations, disadvantages the ability of consumers and businesses to protect their interests sufficiently.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(7) Without net neutrality, 'ISPs will have the power to decide which websites you can access and at what speed each will load. In other words, they'll be able to decide which companies succeed online, which voices are heard - and which are silenced.' Tim Berners-Lee, founder of the World Wide Web and Director of the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), December 13, 2017.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(8) The Federal Communications Commission's (FCC's) recent repeal of the federal net neutrality rules pursuant to its
       Restoring Internet Freedom Order
       manifests a fundamental shift in policy.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(9) The FCC anticipates that a 'light-touch' regulatory approach under Title I of the Communications Act of 1934, rather than 'utility-style' regulation under Title II, will further advance the Congressional goals of promoting broadband deployment and infrastructure investment.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(10) The FCC's regulatory approach is unlikely to achieve the intended results in Vermont. The policy does little, if anything, to overcome the financial challenges of bringing broadband service to hard-to-reach locations with low population density. However, it may result in degraded Internet quality or service. The State has a compelling interest in preserving and protecting consumer access to high quality Internet service.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(11) The economic theory advanced by the FCC in 2010 known as the 'virtuous circle of innovation' seems more relevant to the market conditions in Vermont. See
       In re Preserving the Open Internet,
       25 F.C.C.R. 17905, 17910-11 (2010).
      </p>
      <p>
       "(12) As explained in the FCC's 2010 Order, 'The Internet's openness... enables a virtuous circle of innovation in which new uses of the network - including new content, applications, services, and devices - lead to increased end-user demand for broadband, which drives network improvements, which in turn lead to further innovative network uses. Novel, improved, or lower-cost offerings introduced by content, application, service, and device providers spur end-user demand and encourage broadband providers to expand their networks and invest in new broadband technologies." 25 FCC Rcd. at 17910-11, upheld by
       Verizon v. FCC,
       740 F.3d 623, 644-45 (D.C. Circuit 2014).
      </p>
      <p>
       "(13) As affirmed by the FCC five years later, '[t]he key insight of the virtuous cycle is that broadband providers have both the incentive and the ability to act as gatekeepers standing between edge providers and consumers. As gatekeepers, they can block access altogether; they can target competitors, including competitors in their own video services; and they can extract unfair tolls.'
       Open Internet Order,
       30 FCC Rcd at para. 20.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(14) The State may exercise its traditional role in protecting consumers from potentially unfair and anticompetitive business practices. Doing so will provide critical protections for Vermont individuals, entrepreneurs, and small businesses that do not have the financial clout to negotiate effectively with commercial providers, some of whom may provide services and content that directly compete with Vermont companies or companies with whom Vermonters do business.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(15) The FCC's most recent order expressly contemplates a state's exercise of its traditional police powers on behalf of consumers: 'we do not disturb or displace the states' traditional role in generally policing such matters as fraud, taxation, and general commercial dealings, so long as the administration of such general state laws does not interfere with federal regulatory objectives.'
       Restoring Internet Freedom Order,
       WC Docket No. 17-108, FCC 17-166, para. 196.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(16) The benefits of State measures designed to protect the ability of Vermonters to have unfettered access to the Internet far outweigh the benefits of allowing ISPs to manipulate Internet traffic for pecuniary gain.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(17) The most recent order of the FCC contemplates federal and local enforcement agencies preventing harm to consumers: 'In the unlikely event that ISPs engage in conduct that harms Internet openness . . . we find that utility-style regulation is unnecessary to address such conduct. Other legal regimes - particularly antitrust law and the FTC's authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act to prohibit unfair and deceptive practices - provide protections to consumers.' para. 140. The Attorney General enforces antitrust violations or violations of the Consumer Protection Act in Vermont.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(18) The State has a compelling interest in knowing with certainty what services it receives pursuant to State contracts.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(19) Procurement laws are for the benefit of the State. When acting as a market participant, the government enjoys unrestricted power to contract with whomever it deems appropriate and purchase only those goods or services it desires.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(20) The disclosures required by this act are a reasonable exercise of the State's traditional police powers and will support the State's efforts to monitor consumer protection and economic factors in Vermont, particularly with regard to competition, business practices, and consumer choice, and will also enable consumers to stay apprised of the network management practices of ISPs offering service in Vermont.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(21) The State is in the best position to balance the needs of its constituencies with policies that best serve the public interest. The State has a compelling interest in promoting Internet consumer protection and net neutrality standards. Any incidental burden on interstate commerce resulting from the requirements of this act is far outweighed by the compelling interests the State advances."

       <p>
        It was clear from this section it was the intent of the legislature to bar from re-election an elected official who was over the age of 70; however, this section was ineffective for this purpose, because the state constitution sets no maximum age limit on the right to be elected. 1958-60 Op.

        Mandatory retirement line currently drawn by the legislature for public safety officers bears a reasonable and just relation to a legitimate state interest, and for that reason, there is no violation of the Common Benefits Clause. Badgley v. Walton, 188 Vt. 367, 10 A.3d 469 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mandatory retirement provision for Group C members does not violate the Common Benefits Clause at this time. Under the Clover Leaf Creamery approach, it would be inappropriate for the court to intrude under the clause into an ongoing political process that had not reached its end point. Badgley v. Walton, 188 Vt. 367, 10 A.3d 469 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        The provisions of subdivision (a)(2) of this section requiring mandatory retirement for state police officers at age fifty-five is rationally related to a legitimate governmental purpose of protecting the public by assuring physical preparedness of its uniformed police and, therefore, does not violate the equal protection clause of the federal constitution.

        Municipal Employees Retirement System, the State Employees Retirement System, and the Teachers Retirement System each provides for an award of disability-retirement benefits, and each, in turn, uniformly provides that an employee denied such a benefit is entitled to a contested hearing conducted by a hearing officer, whose decision "shall constitute final administrative action." This language is significant, revealing as it does a clear intent that the agency decision shall be considered "final" solely for purposes of administrative exhaustion and ripeness for subsequent judicial review, not as a bar to such review.

        Under the statute governing denial of state disability retirement benefits and the Vermont Administrative Procedure Act, the proper avenue for an appeal from a state retirement board decision is an appeal directly to the Vermont Supreme Court. Accordingly, the superior court properly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction a claimant's action under the rule allowing review of governmental action. Moran v. Vt. State Ret.

Should any disability beneficiary who has not reached his or her normal retirement date refuse to submit to such medical examination, the beneficiary's allowance may be discontinued until his or her withdrawal of such refusal, and should the beneficiary's refusal continue for one year, all the beneficiary's rights in and to his or her pension may be revoked by the Retirement Board.

In addition, if the Retirement Board's determination is based in whole or in part on a vocational assessment of ability to engage in a gainful occupation, the beneficiary shall be notified of his or her entitlement to the same reemployment rights as are available to State employees under the existing collective bargaining agreement entered into between the State and the applicable bargaining representative, or extension of such contractual benefits. Such rights shall commence as of the date of the determination and shall be based upon the reemployment rights the beneficiary would have had at the time he or she retired from State service. The reduction of pension amount will be held in abeyance until the reemployment rights have expired. In the event that the beneficiary is subsequently reemployed by the State, the beneficiary's retirement allowance shall cease, effective on the date when reemployment commences. In the event that the beneficiary is not subsequently reemployed by the State, the reduction of the beneficiary's pension shall commence the month following the month in which the beneficiary's reemployment rights expired.

The State Treasurer may request, and the beneficiary shall provide within 60 days after such request, additional financial information and records pertinent to the beneficiary's earned income. The beneficiary's statement and accompanying forms and schedules and any other financial information and records provided by the beneficiary to the State Treasurer shall be confidential. In the event that a beneficiary fails to submit the certification or any required or requested financial information or records pertinent to the beneficiary's earned income, the beneficiary's retirement allowance shall be suspended until all such information and records have been submitted, and in the event that the failure continues for one year, all the beneficiary's rights in and to his or her pension and any pending reemployment rights under this section may be revoked by the Board. Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, if the beneficiary's earned income for the preceding year exceeded the difference between the beneficiary's retirement allowance and his or her average final compensation at retirement as adjusted for inflation each year following retirement, the beneficiary shall refund the portion of the preceding year's retirement allowance that is equal to the amount of the reduction specified in subsection (b) of this section, and the refund amount may be offset against the beneficiary's monthly pension benefits.

        Plain meaning of the statute governing retirement allowances of deceased state retirement system members requires Group F members to affirmatively select a beneficiary, and the only persons who may be selected are those whom the member supports. Baldauf v. Vt. State Treasurer, - Vt.

        Under the plain language of the statute governing retirement allowances of deceased state retirement system members, neither the decedent's wife nor his estate was entitled to receive a retirement allowance as the decedent did not designate the wife as his beneficiary during his life, and the plain language of the statute precludes a Group F member from designating an estate as a dependent beneficiary.

        Plain language of the statute governing retirement allowances of deceased state retirement system members precludes a Group F member from designating an estate as a dependent beneficiary. An estate is not a person who relies on another's support for a living, so an estate cannot qualify as a "dependent" under the statute; this conclusion is reinforced by other language in the statute, which provides that a designated dependent beneficiary will receive the retirement allowance "during his or her life."

     §

      </p>
      <p>
       "(1) The disability retirement system for state employees found in chapter 16 of Title 3 requires an injured employee to choose between disability retirement benefits and workers' compensation benefits for temporary disability (pursuant to chapter 9 of Title 21). Eligible employees, who wish to collect disability retirement benefits to provide a stream of income while they are unable to work and who want to continue their health care coverage are required to forfeit their right to appeal the denial of their workers' compensation benefits.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(2) The disability retirement system for state employees found in chapter 16 of Title 3 requires a catastrophically injured employee to choose between disability retirement benefits and permanent total workers' compensation benefits beyond 330 weeks, up to lifetime (pursuant to chapter 9 of Title 21). If a workers' compensation claim is denied and the employee has to accept disability retirement to have an income while he or she appeals the workers' compensation claim, the employee would be waiving significant future workers' compensation benefits with no ability to choose the higher workers' compensation benefit if the claim is ultimately determined to be compensable.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(b) By this act, the general assembly intends to allow an eligible employee to accept disability retirement benefits during the pendency of the employee's compensation appeal. Upon resolution of the workers' compensation claim, the employee would either continue in the disability retirement or resume his or her employee status and receive workers' compensation benefits which the employee would have received if the claim had been accepted at the outset. While an employee will still waive access to workers' compensation benefits under Title 21 in excess of 330 weeks if the employee chooses to accept disability retirement benefits, this waiver applies only to the period after 330 weeks of permanent partial or permanent total disability benefits have been paid. An employee may receive both disability retirement and permanent partial or permanent total benefits under the workers' compensation system for up to 330 weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(c) By this act the general assembly does not intend to enable the concurrent receipt of retirement disability benefits and temporary workers' compensation disability benefits or permanent total benefits beyond 330 weeks."

       </h5>
       <p>
        The purpose of the 1965 amendment to the first paragraph of this section was to provide an allowance to the spouse of a member who died in service after completing not less than twenty-two years of creditable service and it was not related to the allowance paid under the disability retirement allowance provisions of the state employees' retirement system. 1964-66 Op. Atty. Gen. 261.
       </p>
       <p>
        The allowance to the spouse of a member deceased in service after twenty-two years of creditable service, as provided in the first paragraph of this section, was to be calculated on a service retirement rather than a disability retirement basis. 1964-66 Op. Atty. Gen. 261.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the allowance provided under section 375 of this title for a member who retired at age sixty-five, and the allowance provided by this section to the spouse of a member who died in service after age sixty-five was calculated on a service retirement basis, it seemed reasonable that the allowance of a spouse of a member who died in service after twenty-two years of creditable service, as provided in this section, was to be calculated on the same basis, and that the legislature so intended, was borne out by its inclusion of those members who died in service with twenty-two years of creditable service, in the same sentence with those who died in service after reaching age sixty-five. 1964-66 Op. Atty. Gen. 261.
       </p>
       <p>
        Retired member, once having elected a certain plan of benefits, could not subsequently change to another plan by election made after time when first payment on account of a retirement allowance became due normally. 1946-48 Op. Atty. Gen. 398.

In the event of an increase, and provided that the net increase following the application of any offset as provided in this subsection equals or exceeds one percent, the retirement allowance of each beneficiary in receipt of an allowance for at least one year on the next following December 31st shall be increased by an equal percentage.

    The General Assembly intends that the Retirement System and any trusts or custodial accounts established to hold the assets of the Retirement System in accordance with subsection (b) of this section be maintained, in form and operation, so as to maintain the status of the Retirement System as a qualified plan under <cite class="vt-code">26 U.S.C. § 401(a)</cite> as amended, and the tax exempt status of such trusts and custodial accounts under <cite class="vt-code">26 U.S.C. § 501(a)</cite>, to the extent that those requirements apply to a governmental plan as described in 26 U.S.C. § 414.

      In order to extend to employees of the State and its political subdivisions and to the dependents and survivors of such employees the basic protection accorded to others by the Old Age and Survivors Insurance System embodied in the Social Security Act, the State of Vermont authorizes and empowers the Treasurer of the State as a State agency to enter into appropriate agreements with the Secretary of Health and Human Services for the purpose of making available under the provisions of this chapter, to employees of the State and its political subdivisions, the benefits of the Social Security Act.
    It is also the policy of the legislature that the federal-State agreement permitted by this chapter be made applicable to the services of all employees of the State of Vermont to the extent and in the manner permitted by the federal Social Security Act.

     Where a petition for extraordinary relief was brought by a teacher against school board for failure to renew her teaching contract, the jurisdictional basis for the petition, although not explicitly cited by the teacher, was V.R.C.P. 75, governing review of governmental action, and V.R.C.P. 74, governing appeals from decisions of governmental agencies in contested cases, was inapplicable both because review in the case was not provided for by statute, and because this chapter does not apply to school boards.

     Under the statute governing denial of state disability retirement benefits and the Vermont Administrative Procedure Act, the proper avenue for an appeal from a State Retirement Board decision is an appeal directly to the Vermont Supreme Court. Accordingly, the superior court properly dismissed for lack of jurisdiction a claimant's action under the rule allowing review of governmental action. Moran v. Vt. State Ret.

        Given the definition of a contested case under subsection (b)(2) of this section, unless a hearing by agency is required by statute or regulation, there is no right to judicial review under section 815(a) of this title even if administrative decision is rendered.

        Where persons seeking to be made parties in land use development permit hearing came under none of the land use statute requirements for party status, this section's definition of a party as, inter alia, a person properly seeking and entitled as of right to be admitted as a party could not be read with the land use statute to confer party status.

       <p>
        Although the University of Vermont is an instrumentality and agent of the state, the legislature did not intend it to be subject to the types of procedures that govern state administrative agencies; therefore, the university is not an "agency" as defined by subdivision (b)(1) of this section.

        Claim for State disability retirement benefits was a "contested case" within the meaning of the Vermont Administrative Procedure Act because the retirement board was required to give the claimant a hearing to determine whether the claimant had a right to disability retirement benefits. Moran v. Vt. State Ret. Bd., 200 Vt. 354, 131 A.3d 212 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because contested cases relate only to the legal rights, duties, or privileges of the specific parties to the case, a contested case was inappropriate for creation of the type of broad, general procedures sought by customers for governing statewide utility diversion issues. Beaupre v. Green Mountain Power Corp., 172 Vt. 583, 776 A.2d 424 (2001).

        Because plaintiffs were not parties to State agency's decision to grant encroachment permit allowing town's construction of bridge, plaintiffs could not register demand for a contested case hearing, and their claim asserting violation of Vermont Administrative Procedures Act was therefore properly dismissed.

        The Superior Court's rulings were accurate and important to the overall disposition of the air pollution issues: first, it correctly articulated that V.R.C.P. 74 was amended to extend its coverage to all cases when review of agency action is provided by law in the Superior Court, whether or not involving a contested case; and second, the review of the agency decision would occur based on the record of the agency, with some deference given to the agency's determination.

        Where, in response to a proposed contract submitted by a non-profit hospital service corporation in accordance with the terms of prior orders relating to a requested rate increase, the Commissioner of Banking and Insurance issued a directive, without a prior hearing, which contained "required modifications" to substantive provisions of the proposed contract, since it was reasonable to conclude that the required modifications would have to be made before the corporation could expect the Commissioner's approval of its rate increase request, the order was a contested case in which the Commissioner made a determination of the corporation's legal duties, and was invalid because it was issued without a prior hearing. In re Vermont Health Service Corp., 144 Vt. 617, 482 A.2d 294 (1984).

        The presence of a right, duty or privilege within the definition of a contested case in this section is questionable in the case of claims by state employees for workmen's compensation benefits in light of the absence of statutory mandate for the award sought, provision only for maximum amount, and leaving of any award at all to the judgment and discretion of the board. Howard v. Office of Secretary of State, 140 Vt. 139, 435 A.2d 962 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where statutes and regulations governing state department did not require a hearing for employee challenging failure to promote him, the grievance was not a contested case within section 815 of this title, providing for appeal to Supreme Court in a contested case, and employee's grievance could not be appealed to Supreme Court. Reed v. Department of Public Safety, 137 Vt. 9, 398 A.2d 301 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, though Commissioner of Banking and Insurance held public hearing on request to open branch bank, law did not require a hearing, case was not a contested one and competing bank had no right of appeal under V.R.C.P. 74 providing for appeal in a contested case governed by this chapter. In re Marble Savings Bank, 137 Vt. 123, 400 A.2d 1022 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where law governing retirement system made no provision for hearing upon any issue or determination under its terms, denial of request to add credit to an account was not a contested case within provision of section 815 of this title for appeal to Supreme Court in a contested case and there could be no appeal to Superior Court under V.R.C.P. 74.

       <p>
        Under the provisions of this section, a hearing is required when the proceeding will determine legal rights, duties or privileges of a party, and in using right or privilege to define contested case, the Legislature intended something which the petitionees will hold as a right or privilege which is exclusive to them as, for example, a license to operate a motor vehicle, or the right to the exclusive use of certain lands such as an oil or mining lease. 1968-70 Op. Atty. Gen. 159.

        Public Service Board properly employed rulemaking, rather than contested case procedures, in setting rates that small power producers may charge utilities. In re Department of Public Service, 161 Vt. 97, 632 A.2d 1373 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Department of Social Welfare's decision to rescind policy change that would have increased Aid to Needy Families with Children program benefits fell within definition of rulemaking under subdivision (b)(9) of this section and was invalid because it was not adopted in manner prescribed by this chapter. In re Diel, 158 Vt. 549, 614 A.2d 1223 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subdivision (b)(9) of this section, which defines a "rule," in the context of an agency proceeding, should not be so literally or strictly construed that an agency's powers are limited to a degree leading to irrational consequences. In re Telesystems, Corp., 143 Vt. 504, 469 A.2d 1169 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the Public Service Board ordered company to provide its customers with converter devices pursuant to its policy "that cable television companies provide these devices to their customers without charge," this statement of policy did not constitute rule making in violation of section 836 of this title, since the statement was made within the context of the matter before it, did not have general applicability and fell properly within the Board's jurisdiction over the rate structures and the nature of services provided by all public service corporations. In re Telesystems, Corp., 143 Vt. 504, 469 A.2d 1169 (1983).

        Regulations adopted by Agency of Natural Resources to control vapor emissions at gasoline pumps were not invalid due to Agency's failure to use statutory definition of a small business as one with twenty or fewer employees; Agency's use of 400,000 gallon-per-year throughput standard to exempt and phase-in small businesses was better calibrated to assess economic impact of regulation, and was reasonable on its face.

        Plain text of the provision of the Administrative Procedure Act allowing for declaratory judgment actions, and case law explaining why the Legislature created a declaratory-judgment remedy, indicate that the provision is not the exclusive way to challenge agency regulations. In re Mt. Top Inn & Resort, Jo 1-391, - Vt.
    - , 238 A.3d 637 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the Superior Court has general statutory authority to grant declaratory relief, declaratory judgment statutes do not ipso jure vest jurisdiction in the Superior Court over claims jurisdiction over which the Legislature has granted to other tribunals. Williams v. State, 156 Vt. 42, 589 A.2d 840 (1990), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 821, 112 S. Ct. 81, 116 L. Ed. 2d 54, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 984, 112 S. Ct. 590, 116 L. Ed. 2d 614 (1991).

       § 808. Procedure to request declaratory rulings by agencies.
       <br />
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Each agency shall provide for the filing and prompt disposition of petitions for declaratory rulings as to the applicability of any statutory provision or of any rule or order of the agency, and may so provide by procedure or rule. Rulings disposing of petitions have the same status as agency decisions or orders in contested cases.

        Administrative declaratory judgments are essentially procedures similar to declaratory judgments in courts; thus, general restrictions on the power to issue declaratory relief govern the disposition of petitions under this section.

       <p>
        Since section 807 of this title authorizes declaratory judgments on the validity or applicability of an administrative rule, while this section allows agencies to make declaratory rulings on the applicability of any of its rules or orders, legislative intent was that the validity of one of its orders was not an appropriate subject for an agency declaratory ruling.

       <p>
        In issuing declaratory rulings pursuant to this section, the Public Service Board is restricted to deciding the applicability of administrative or statutory authorities to a particular set of facts, and declaratory judgments issued under this section may not test the validity of such provisions.

        Declaratory rulings are not appellate in nature, and cannot be resorted to as a substitute for, or in lieu of, proper appellate remedies. In re D. A. Associates, 150 Vt. 18, 547 A.2d 1325 (1988).

         5. Jurisdiction.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Public Service Board properly held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to rule on a utility's declaratory judgment petition. The statute relied upon by the utility had no necessary application at all to the declaratory judgment it sought, as the utility did not assert, and had never asserted, a right to maintain the power line in its present location by virtue of adverse possession; that section being the only basis recited for the Board's jurisdiction, there was no error in the Board's determination that it had no power to rule on the declaratory judgment petition. In re Appeal of Morrisville Water & Light Dep't, 184 Vt. 616, 958 A.2d 1191 (mem.) (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        In view of statutes giving the Public Service Board the powers of a court of record and stating that its decisions are appealable to the supreme court, there is no limitation on the power of the board to consider the validity of its own rules adopted to implement the federal Public Utility Regulatory Policies Act of 1978 in the course of regulatory adjudication, other than a declaratory judgment under this section. Barnet Hydro Co. v. Public Service Board, 174 Vt. 464, 807 A.2d 347 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme Court had no jurisdiction to resolve appeal on the merits of a declaratory ruling which the commissioner of water resources and environmental engineering had no power to make. In re D. A. Associates, 150 Vt. 18, 547 A.2d 1325 (1988).

        Notice to liquor licensee that it would be charged with selling a patron alcoholic liquor when that patron was apparently under the influence of liquor was insufficient under subdivision (b)(4) of this section where the notice and the investigation reports which the notice stated were available upon request were devoid of any facts alleging a sale to a patron under the influence.

       <p>
        Where the evidence presented at the contested case hearing overwhelmingly established that the alleged violation occurred, the fact that the Liquor Control Board imposed a greater sanction than that proposed during the settlement process did not demonstrate bias. In re Odessa Corp., 179 Vt. 640, 898 A.2d 1256 (mem.) (April 25, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a proceeding before the Liquor Control Board, the Board did not commit reversible error in admitting a settlement offer into evidence because the offer was not introduced to prove the allegation against the licensee, but was offered by the stater in response to the licensee's motion to recuse the members of the Board. In re Odessa Corp., 179 Vt. 640, 898 A.2d 1256 (mem.) (April 25, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a proceeding before the Liquor Control Board, the Board did not abuse its discretion in excluding a written statement prepared by the licensee's store clerk after the incident which was the basis for the charged violation; the document was not admissible as a business record under V.R.E. 803(6), and was properly excluded by the Board as inherently unreliable hearsay. In re Odessa Corp., 179 Vt. 640, 898 A.2d 1256 (mem.) (April 25, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Rules of evidence are relaxed in Public Service Board proceedings so that evidence not admissible in court is admissible by the Board if it may illuminate the case; however, evidence must be admitted before it is relied upon by the Board. In re Twenty-Four Vermont Utilities, 159 Vt. 339, 618 A.2d 1295 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Computer data prepared by department of public service should not have been considered by public service board as evidence in support of its approval of utilities' electric power agreement, where admissibility of data had never been tested by a formal offer with the opportunity for its opponents to contest admissibility. In re Twenty-Four Vermont Utilities, 159 Vt. 339, 618 A.2d 1295 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Environmental Board abused its discretion by failing to give parties an opportunity to present evidence as to matters bearing on whether proposed condominium conversion would effect a material or substantial change requiring a land use permit amendment. In re Gallagher, 150 Vt. 50, 549 A.2d 637 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        At hearing on petition to revoke Act 250 permit, Environmental Board denied parties' right under subsection (c) of this section to offer evidence on the remedy to be imposed for breach of permit, where each party was limited to a five-minute offer of proof.

        There was no per se violation of due process where the Liquor Control Board rejected a settlement offer, conducted a contested case hearing, and decided the matter on the merits. In re Odessa Corp., 179 Vt. 640, 898 A.2d 1256 (mem.) (April 25, 2006).

        Where dispute concerning maintenance of ditch and fence between railroad and adjoining landowner resulted in hearing before Public Service Board and parties entering stipulation for discontinuance and settlement agreement, without Board's issuing formal order of discontinuance, provision of this section that informal disposition may be made of any contested case by stipulation or agreed settlement required finding that there was a disposition, however informal; and since matter was no longer pending before Board, trial court's refusal to entertain jurisdiction upon ground that Board had original jurisdiction was error.

        Public Service Board did not violate subsection (c) of this section by postponing consideration of and denying discovery relating to highly speculative issue of enormous complexity, since Board did not have indefinite time frame to decide cases, and since no probability was demonstrated that exploration of issue would have any effect on outcome of case.

        In a proceeding before the Liquor Control Board, the Board did not err in denying the licensee's motion for a continuance because the Board acted within its wide discretion in denying the motion based on its finding that the licensee was responsible for securing the attendance of its own witnesses, and that the delay would be unfair to the State.

       <p>
        Although the statutory scheme did not specifically authorize the creation of a hearing committee comprising less than a quorum of the Board of Dental Examiners, it did not necessarily follow that the process followed by the Board was prohibited by law or beyond the ability of the parties to cure by waiver, consent, or agreement. A statutory reference to circumstances in which less than a majority of the decisionmaking agency had heard the case or read the record plainly contemplated hearings before a minority of the Board. In re Lakatos, 182 Vt. 487, 939 A.2d 510 (Oct. 19, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no basis to conclude that a procedure under which a hearing committee comprising less than a quorum of the Board of Dental Examiners held an evidentiary hearing on charges of unprofessional conduct was "prohibited by law" such that a finding of waiver or acquiescence by the parties would nullify the statute prohibiting it. The record, moreover, left no doubt that respondent waived any challenge to the procedure by failing to raise an objection at any point during the hearing process in which he actively participated.

        In concluding that a decision of the Board of Dental Examiners violated due process because six of the nine board members had not observed witnesses, the trial court erred in finding that the Board's decision rested in material part on assessments of witness demeanor and conduct. The record showed that the Board's findings were based on objective evidence assessed in light of the Board's expertise and the inherent likelihood or unlikelihood of certain events, and that subjective judgments about demeanor or conduct played little or no role in its findings.

        Where the Court, in an appeal of an order issued by the Secretary of the Agency of Natural Resources, was unable to address many of the arguments raised because the Secretary had not ruled on proposed findings, the case was remanded for the Secretary to issue a decision in compliance with the statute. The Court will remand if it is left in a position where it must speculate as to the basis of the decision reached. Secretary v.

       </h5>
       <p>
        There is no merit to the argument that the provision of the Administrative Procedure Act regarding licenses violates due process on its face by permitting a summary suspension in exigent circumstances. Indeed, consistent with the high court's recognition of an emergency exception to the predeprivation hearing requirement, numerous states have adopted identical or similar statutes based on a provision in the Model State Administrative Procedures Act authorizing the summary suspension of a state-issued license where public health, safety, or welfare imperatively requires emergency action. In re Miller, 186 Vt. 505, 989 A.2d 982 (2009).

        Because plaintiffs were not parties to State agency's decision to grant encroachment permit allowing town's construction of bridge, plaintiffs could not register demand for a contested case hearing, and their claim asserting violation of Vermont Administrative Procedure Act was therefore properly dismissed.

        Section 236 of Title 7, which gives the Liquor Control Commission broad authority to control the conduct of liquor licensees and to discipline for proscribed conduct, must be read in conjunction with subsection (b) of this section, which specifically envisions situations where a license is to be renewed, but subject to limiting terms.

        Subsection (c) of this section, governing hearings on proceedings for revocation, suspension, annulment, or withdrawal of licenses, was complied with where licensees charged with violations were given a hearing where they could demonstrate that, at the time of the alleged violation, they were in full compliance with all lawful requirements; this section did not entitle the licensees to two hearings, an informal one for the purpose of explaining the charges without a threat of final decision and a formal hearing where the issues were finally determined.

        Department of Education had an insufficient basis for refusing to issue a principal her educator's license, which expired by its own terms while suspension proceedings were pending, when it indicated that it did not want to issue the license because it could be considered verification that she met the competence standards, which the Department believed that she did not. The principal had a right to challenge the merits of the Department's position before her license was taken away. In re Licensing Appeal of J.H., 184 Vt. 293, 958 A.2d 700 (2008).

       <p>
        Within one month of a summary suspension order of a physician's license, the physician requested, and the Medical Practice Board promptly granted, an evidentiary hearing to reconsider the order. Therefore, any facial or as-applied due-process challenge to the provision of the Administrative Procedure Act regarding licenses predicated on the lack of a prompt postsuspension hearing was rendered moot. In re Miller, 186 Vt. 505, 989 A.2d 982 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Physician whose license was summarily suspended was afforded the opportunity to submit prefiled testimony challenging the State's evidence, to cross-examine the State's investigator on the charges, and to testify in his own behalf. This was sufficient to satisfy the requisites of due process pending a more comprehensive final hearing on the merits. In re Miller, 186 Vt. 505, 989 A.2d 982 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a proceeding to summarily suspend a physician's license, the failure to admit four letters from the physician's former colleagues did not violate due process. To the extent that these were offered as testimonials to his good character, they were properly excluded as more appropriate to a merits hearing and ultimate questions relating to discipline and mitigation; to the extent that the letters contained information attesting to his judgment, they had some relevance to the question whether a remedy short of suspension would be sufficient to protect the public, but any error was harmless because it was clear that the Medical Practice Board implicitly considered and rejected the limited-remedy option. In re Miller, 186 Vt. 505, 989 A.2d 982 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Medical Practice Board's reliance on a supplemental affidavit submitted by the State's investigator did not deprive a physician whose license was summarily suspended of fair notice of the charges to be addressed. While the supplemental affidavit provided additional detail, it did not alter the basic charges against the physician or present an unfair surprise at the postsuspension hearing. In re Miller, 186 Vt. 505, 989 A.2d 982 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the Department of Education refused to issue a principal her educator's license, which had expired by its own terms while a suspension proceeding was pending, there was no support for its assertion that her rights were sufficiently protected by listing her as licensed in the Department's database. The principal was entitled to retain her license until the Board of Education rendered its decision, and this necessarily included the right to physically possess the license. In re Licensing Appeal of J.H., 184 Vt. 293, 958 A.2d 700 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court rejected the Department of Education's assertion that a principal's license was available to her and that she was to blame for her failure to inform the licensing office as to how she wanted it to handle her license, which expired by its own terms while a suspension proceeding was pending against her. The onus was not on the principal because by statute and by rule, she was entitled to remain licensed until suspended, period. In re Licensing Appeal of J.H., 184 Vt. 293, 958 A.2d 700 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        By refusing to issue a principal a copy of her written educator's license, which expired by its own terms while suspension proceedings were pending, the Department of Education violated the statute pertaining to licenses and the State Board of Education's rules. It effectively suspended the license for 14 months without first providing the principal an opportunity to be heard, contrary to the basic elements of due process.

       <p>
        Although a physician asserted a sufficient facial challenge to the statute regarding summary suspension of licenses, his claim was moot. The physician was not currently under summary suspension, and, after the Board of Medical Practice reinstated his license, he voluntarily consented to refrain from the practice of medicine until the Board proceedings were completed; thus, declaration of the constitutionality of the summary-suspension procedures would not affect any of his presently cognizable legal interests. Chase v. State, 184 Vt. 430, 966 A.2d 139 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        "Capable of repetition, but evading review" exception to the mootness doctrine did not apply when a physician who challenged the constitutionality of the statute regarding summary suspension of licenses no longer had his license suspended and had not suggested that he was likely to be subject to another summary suspension or disciplinary proceeding. Chase v. State, 184 Vt. 430, 966 A.2d 139 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because no compelling constitutional interests were harmed by the mere existence of the statute regarding summary suspension of licenses, the court dismissed as moot a physician's facial challenge because he was not currently subject to enforcement proceedings under the statute. Chase v. State, 184 Vt. 430, 966 A.2d 139 (2008).

        Party seeking review of a preliminary, procedural, or intermediate agency action bears burden of demonstrating that appeal from a final order would not provide an adequate remedy. Beaupre v. Green Mountain Power Corp., 168 Vt. 596, 715 A.2d 1292 (mem.) (1998).

        Under judicial review provision of Administrative Procedure Act, an intermediate ruling is appealable only if review of the final decision would not provide an adequate remedy. In re Taft Corners Assocs., 160 Vt. 583, 632 A.2d 649 (1993).

       <p>
        Since appeals of interlocutory rulings of administrative agencies were to be treated as appeals from final decisions, developer's appeal from Environmental Board decision was not governed by V.R.A.P. 5 or V.R.A.P. 5.1, but was treated as an appeal from a final decision under V.R.A.P. 4, and developer's notice of appeal was therefore timely. In re Taft Corners Assocs., 160 Vt. 583, 632 A.2d 649 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where Environmental Board's remand decision clearly exceeded Board's jurisdiction and required permit applicant virtually to commence application process again, delay and expense justified supreme court's consideration of interlocutory decision. In re Taft Corners Assocs., 160 Vt. 583, 632 A.2d 649 (1993).

        For collateral order to be appealable it must (1) conclusively determine disputed question, (2) resolve an important issue completely separate from merits of action, and (3) be effectively unreviewable on appeal from final judgment. In re Maple Tree Place Assocs., 151 Vt. 331, 560 A.2d 382 (1989), overruled on other grounds sub nom. In re J.G. (1993) 160 Vt. 250, 627 A.2d 362.

       <p>
        Interlocutory order by Environmental Board denying appellants' request to participate fully in proceedings under section 6086 of Title 10 on permit to build shopping mall was not appealable to Supreme Court, as District Environmental Commission's order limiting participation was reviewable de novo before the Board and Board's decision could be reviewed by Supreme Court. In re Maple Tree Place Assocs., 151 Vt. 331, 560 A.2d 382 (1989), overruled on other grounds sub nom. In re J.G. (1993) 160 Vt. 250, 627 A.2d 362.

       <p>
        The right to appeal under subsection (a) of this section, authorizing an immediate appeal from a preliminary, procedural, or intermediate agency action or ruling in a contested case, is limited to those cases where review of the final decision will not provide an adequate remedy, and that limitation places upon appellants the burden of demonstrating that an appeal from a final order will not provide such a remedy. In re Central Vermont Public Service Corp., 142 Vt. 138, 453 A.2d 1108 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to justify an appeal under subsection (a) of this section, authorizing an immediate appeal from a preliminary, procedural, or intermediate agency action or ruling in a contested case, it must at least be shown that appeal of the ultimate order will not provide an adequate remedy or that the nature of the claimed defect in the order is such that harm is greatly aggravated by delay; it is not every theoretically possible harm the imagination can conceive which will satisfy the test. In re Central Vermont Public Service Corp., 142 Vt. 138, 453 A.2d 1108 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public utility's motion to dismiss appeal from order granting temporary rate increase was granted where appellant failed to meet the burden of demonstrating that an appeal from a final order would not provide an adequate remedy since the reasons offered by the appellant as justification for appeal under subsection (a) of this section, authorizing an immediate appeal from a preliminary, procedural or intermediate agency action or ruling, were speculative, remote, and de minimis at best. In re Central Vermont Public Service Corp., 142 Vt. 138, 453 A.2d 1108 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Issue whether Public Service Board could grant a second temporary electricity rate increase when the first was still in effect could be considered on appeal to Supreme Court under provision of this section allowing appeal of otherwise interlocutory orders if "review of the final decision would not provide an adequate remedy, and the filing of the appeal did not itself stay enforcement of the agency decision." In re Green Mountain Power Corp., 133 Vt. 107, 329 A.2d 372 (1974).

        Given the definition of a contested case under section 801(b)(2) of this title, unless a hearing by an agency is required by statute or regulation, there is no right to judicial review under subsection (a) of this section even if an administrative decision is rendered.

       <p>
        Trial court should not have relied on this section as basis for remanding denial of subdivision and site plan approval back to planning commission; court's application of this section by cross reference from statute governing appeal to Superior Court was mistaken in that statute fell far short of incorporating this chapter into appeals from decisions of other-than-state entities, and applicable procedural rule nowhere provided for remand or incorporation of other Administrative Procedure Act procedure.

        Small business provisions of Administrative Procedure Act did not confer any substantive rights on small businesses or impose any substantive obligation on Agency of Natural Resources; nor did they provide small businesses with any additional grounds to contest a regulation, absent Agency's failure to consider enumerated alternatives.

        Regulations promulgated by Agency of Natural Resources to control vapor emissions at gasoline pumps were not invalid due to Agency's failure to use statutory definition of a small business as one with twenty or fewer employees; Agency's use of 400,000 gallon-per-year throughput standard to exempt and phase-in small businesses was better calibrated to assess economic impact of regulation, and was reasonable on its face.

      If a rule affects or provides for the regulation of public education and public schools, the economic impact analysis shall include a specific and clearly demarcated evaluation of the cost implications to local school districts and school taxpayers and shall clearly state the associated costs. This evaluation also shall include consideration of alternatives to the rule, including having no rule on the subject, that would reduce or ameliorate costs to local school districts while achieving the objectives or purposes of the proposed rule.

     <p>
      Analyze the anticipated environmental impacts, whether positive or negative, from adoption of the rule. Examples of environmental impacts include the emission of greenhouse gases; the discharge of pollutants to water; and effects on the ability of the environment to provide benefits such as food and fresh water, regulation of climate and water flow, and recreation.

        Small business provisions of Administrative Procedure Act did not confer any substantive rights on small businesses or impose any substantive obligation on Agency of Natural Resources; nor did they provide small businesses with any additional grounds to contest a regulation, absent Agency's failure to consider enumerated alternatives.

        Regulations promulgated by Agency of Natural Resources to control vapor emissions at gasoline pumps were not invalid due to Agency's failure to use statutory definition of a small business as one with twenty or fewer employees; Agency's use of 400,000 gallon-per-year throughput standard to exempt and phase-in small businesses was better calibrated to assess economic impact of regulation, and was reasonable on its face.

       Where an agency believes that there exists an imminent peril to public health, safety, or welfare, it may adopt an emergency rule. The rule may be adopted without having been prefiled or filed in proposed or final proposed form, and may be adopted after whatever notice and hearing the agency finds to be practicable under the circumstances. The agency shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that emergency rules are known to persons who may be affected by them.

      <li id="t03p01c25sub03s844ol1b">
       Emergency rules adopted under this section shall not remain in effect for more than 180 days. An agency may propose a permanent rule on the same subject at the same time that it adopts an emergency rule.
      </li>
      <li id="t03p01c25sub03s844ol1c">
       Emergency rules adopted under this section shall be filed with the Secretary of State and with the Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules. The Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules shall distribute copies of emergency rules to the appropriate standing committees.
      </li>
      <li id="t03p01c25sub03s844ol1d">

         as much of the information required for the filing of a proposed rule as is practicable under the circumstances; and

        <li id="t03p01c25sub03s844ol1d2">
         a signed and dated statement by the adopting authority explaining the nature of the imminent peril to the public health, safety, or welfare and approving of the contents of the rules.

         When objection is made under this subsection, on majority vote of the entire Committee, the Committee may file the objection in certified form with the Secretary of State. The objection shall contain a concise statement of the Committee's reasons for its action. The Secretary shall affix to each objection a certification of its filing and as soon as practicable transmit a copy to the agency. After a Committee objection is filed with the Secretary under this subsection, to the extent that the objection covers a rule or portion of a rule, the burden of proof thereafter shall be on the agency in any action for judicial review or for enforcement of the rule to establish that the part objected to is within the authority delegated to the agency, is consistent with the intent of the Legislature, is not arbitrary, and is justified by an imminent peril to the public health, safety, or welfare. If the agency fails to meet its burden of proof, the court shall declare the whole or portion of the rule objected to invalid. The failure of the Committee to object to a rule is not an implied legislative authorization of its substantive or procedural lawfulness.

         When the Committee makes an objection to an emergency rule under this subsection, the agency may withdraw the rule to which an objection was made. Prior to withdrawal, the agency shall give notice to the Committee of its intent to withdraw the rule. A rule shall be withdrawn upon the filing of a notice of withdrawal with the Secretary of State and the Committee. If the emergency rule amended an existing rule, upon withdrawal of the emergency rule, the existing rule shall revert to its original form, as though the emergency rule had never been adopted.

       In response to an expressed concern of the Legislative Committee on Administrative Rules, an agency may make a germane change to an emergency rule that is approved by the Committee.

     Only reasonable interpretation of purpose behind 1976 amendment to State Labor Relations Act (SLRA), State Employees Labor Relations Act (SELRA), and Municipal Employees Relations Act (MERA) is that legislature intended to consolidate general powers and procedures of Labor Relations Board in SELRA and to apply them to proceedings in each of three labor-relations statutes, while leaving intact particular procedures expressly provided for in SLRA and MERA. Board of Trustees of Kellogg-Hubbard Library, Inc. v. Labor Relations Board, 162 Vt. 571, 649 A.2d 784 (1994).
    </p>
    <p>
     Although 3 V.S.A.
     §
     924(d) of State Employees Labor Relations Act (SELRA) requires Labor Relations Board (LRB) to exercise all powers and follow procedures set forth in SLRA and Municipal Employees Relations Act (MERA), neither SLRA nor MERA include all of general powers necessary to carry out LRB's responsibilities under those statutes. Board of Trustees of Kellogg-Hubbard Library, Inc. v. Labor Relations Board, 162 Vt. 571, 649 A.2d 784 (1994).
    </p>
    <p>
     Legislature intended to afford aggrieved parties right to appeal to Supreme Court from final decisions in all types of proceedings under each of three statutes administered by Labor Relations Board (State Labor Relations Act (SLRA), State Employees Labor Relations Act (SELRA), and Municipal Employees Relations Act (MERA)). Board of Trustees of Kellogg-Hubbard Library, Inc. v. Labor Relations Board, 162 Vt. 571, 649 A.2d 784 (1994).
    </p>
    <p>
     State Labor Relations Act (SLRA), State Employees Labor Relations Act (SELRA), and Municipal Employees Relations Act (MERA) are closely related and, therefore, should be considered in pari materia as part of one system intended to oversee labor relations. Board of Trustees of Kellogg-Hubbard Library, Inc. v. Labor Relations Board, 162 Vt. 571, 649 A.2d 784 (1994).
    </p>
    <p>
     It would not make sense to afford aggrieved parties the right to appeal from Labor Relations Board (LRB) orders in all proceedings under State Employees Labor Relations Act (SELRA) and Municipal Employees Relations Act (MERA), but to force parties to use indirect appeal route under V.R.C.P. 75 to appeal from LRB orders in identical proceedings under State Labor Relations Act. Board of Trustees of Kellogg-Hubbard Library, Inc. v. Labor Relations Board, 162 Vt. 571, 649 A.2d 784 (1994).

        2003.
       </b>
       Near the beginning of subdiv. (5)(I), substituted "department of finance and management" for "department of budget and management" in light of Executive Order No. 35-87, which provided for the abolition of the department of budget and management and the transfer of equipment and authorized positions of that entity to the department of finance and management as established by the order; however, the equipment and position of the administrative secretary of the former department were transferred to the office of the secretary of administration, and the former commissioner of budget and management became the deputy secretary of administration pursuant to the order.
    By its own terms, Executive Order No. 35-87 became effective on July 1, 1987, pursuant to section 2002 of Title 3.
    For the text of Executive Order No. 35-87, see chapter 3 of Title 3 Appendix.

        Local employment services office managers, and managers of local unemployment compensation offices, throughout the state, who directed operations in their districts, were properly classified as managerial personnel by labor relations board for purposes of this chapter.

       <p>
        Failure of a state employer to follow a binding rule constitutes an actionable grievance. In re Gobin, 158 Vt. 432, 610 A.2d 150 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        University of Vermont professor established prima facie case for grievance where he showed a salary $6,000.00 less than mean salary of full professors, and University Provost Memorandum Guidelines constituted binding rules within meaning of subdivision (14) of this section. In re Gobin, 158 Vt. 432, 610 A.2d 150 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        In grievance proceedings, the jurisdiction of the labor relations board is governed by the definition of the term "grievance" in subdivision (14) of this section. Boynton v. Snelling, 147 Vt. 564, 522 A.2d 232 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the extent of labor relations board's jurisdiction in grievance proceedings is limited by the definition of the term "grievance" in subdivision (14) of this section, it extends to an employee's complaint that her dismissal violated the collective bargaining agreement between the state and its workers. In re Muzzy, 141 Vt. 463, 449 A.2d 970 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        State employee's involuntary termination was an aspect of her employment and, therefore, a grievance as defined in subdivision (14) of this section. In re Stacey, 138 Vt. 68, 411 A.2d 1359 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jurisdiction of labor relations board in employee grievance proceedings is governed by the definition of the term "grievance" set out in subdivision (14) of this section. In re Gage, 137 Vt. 16, 398 A.2d 297 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        An actionable grievance under subdivision (14) of this section does not require a finding of racial bias or malicious motive as would be required in an action for an unfair labor practice under section 961 of this title. Nzomo v. Vermont State Colleges, 136 Vt. 97, 385 A.2d 1099 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Discrimination, as that term is used in subdivision (14) of this section, means unequal treatment of individuals in the same circumstances under the applicable rule. Nzomo v. Vermont State Colleges, 136 Vt. 97, 385 A.2d 1099 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        A request to reclassify a state employee's job grade is not a grievance as defined in subdivision (14) of this section. In re McMahon, 136 Vt. 512, 394 A.2d 1136 (1978).

       <p>
        Because it was within the Vermont Labor Relations Board's discretion to determine the units most appropriate to best represent the interest of the employees, and the Board found that the facts had not changed enough to create a question of unit representation, the Board acted within its discretion and expertise when concluding that the union, which sought an election of collective bargaining representatives, had failed to demonstrate reasonable cause to believe a question of unit determination existed.

      ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF ARBITRATION
     </p>
     <p>
      (The parties) understand that this agreement contains a provision for binding arbitration as a final step of the grievance process. After the effective date of this agreement, no grievance, submitted to binding arbitration, may be brought to the Vermont Labor Relations Board. An employee who has declined representation by the employee organization or whom the employee organization has declined to represent or is unable to represent, shall be entitled, either by representing himself or herself or with the assistance of independent legal counsel, to appeal his or her grievance to the Vermont Labor Relations Board as the final step of the grievance process in accordance with the rules and regulations adopted by the Board.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The function of the labor relations board under this section is to decide whether there was, in law, just cause for the action taken, not whether it agrees or disagrees with that action. In re Goddard, 142 Vt. 437, 457 A.2d 637 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        In grievance proceedings, the labor relations board acts as a quasi-judicial body, determining questions of law and fact as an incident to the performance of its administrative duties. In re Brooks, 135 Vt. 563, 382 A.2d 204 (1977).

         2. Jurisdiction.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Under this section, the labor relations board has jurisdiction to determine employee grievances; however, that jurisdiction is somewhat limited by the definition of the term "grievance" in section 902(14) of this title, which relates to expressed dissatisfaction involving a collective bargaining agreement or the discriminatory application of a rule or regulation. In re Guttman, 139 Vt. 574, 431 A.2d 491 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where decision of labor relations board on grievance filed by teacher, who was not rehired because she had reached the mandatory retirement age deemed applicable to her, was based on its interpretation of a collective bargaining agreement, the board's exercise of jurisdiction was proper. In re Guttman, 139 Vt. 574, 431 A.2d 491 (1981).

         3. Discrimination.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where state college failed to follow its stated rule that recommendation that teacher be terminated be discussed with teacher before passing recommendation on to college president and his advisory committee on promotion and tenure, and failed to show valid modification of the rule through unwritten custom or usage consisting of past practice whereby rule was not used, there was discrimination in the sense that there was unequal treatment of individuals in the same circumstances under the applicable rule and, the rule being binding, there was a grievance under this section and state board's finding to the contrary would be reversed.

       <p>
        Where collective bargaining contract provided that failure of a grievant to comply with the time limits of the complaint procedure or of steps one and two would preclude subsequent filing of the grievance, and college faculty member who was not reappointed and who filed a grievance did not raise issue of timeliness of the notice of nonreappointment until step two, the issue was barred, on ground of waiver, from consideration before the labor relations board and before the supreme court on appeal.

        Labor relations board did not err when it considered a petition for formation of a separate collective bargaining unit for correctional employees which included nonmanagement and supervisory employees and issued an order authorizing a unit different from the one proposed in the petition, since if, after hearing a petition, the board determines that the unit as proposed is inappropriate, it may under this section order the formation of a unit that is an appropriate one.

        Vermont Labor Relations Board applied the correct legal standard when, having determined that the petitioned-for unit was not appropriate, it then determined an appropriate unit and ordered its formation. The Board was not comparing the two potential unit configurations to determine which was more appropriate - rather, it rejected the petitioned-for unit and then exercised its broad discretion to authorize an appropriate unit.

        Unless the labor relations board unduly or unfairly restricts the presentation of evidence so as to deprive a party of a meaningful opportunity to be heard, its evidentiary determinations will be upheld. In re Merrill, 151 Vt. 270, 559 A.2d 651 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        In reviewing dismissal of state employee, labor relations board acted correctly in refraining from examining reasons other than those stated in letter of dismissal, or those delineated in a termination meeting. In re Merrill, 151 Vt. 270, 559 A.2d 651 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        While subdivision (b)(3) of this section provides that the labor relations board is not bound by the rules of evidence in its proceedings, it is essential that the board recognize the right of parties under subdivision (b)(6) to present witnesses, give evidence, and examine witnesses. Fairchild v. Vermont State Colleges, 141 Vt. 362, 449 A.2d 932 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the labor relations board is not bound by rules of evidence in its proceedings, it is bound to grant the parties a fair and open hearing which means the parties have the right to present witnesses, give evidence and examine witnesses before the board.

       <p>
        Vermont Labor Relations Board properly determined that the petitioned-for bargaining unit, which would combine part-time distance-learning program (DLP) faculty into the existing part-time faculty bargaining unit, was inappropriate when it found that the two groups did not share a community of interests because there were student differences, courses designed and implemented in a substantially different manner, separate hiring and supervision, different compensation considerations, and no evident interaction among the DLP faculty exclusively teaching online courses and the members of the part-time faculty unit. In re Vt. State Colleges Faculty Fedn., AFT Local 3180, 210 Vt. 476, 216 A.3d 1259 (Aug. 2, 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the labor relations board found, and the record disclosed, a substantial community of interest among members of the police services department of a university, the department was properly certified as a bargaining unit. Chauffeurs, Teamsters, Warehousemen, Helpers Union Local 597 v. University of Vermont, 167 Vt. 564, 702 A.2d 75 (mem.) (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        A collective bargaining unit approved by the labor relations board need not be the most appropriate unit, only an appropriate unit. In re VSEA, Inc., 143 Vt. 636, 471 A.2d 230 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Over fragmentation is only one of several criteria which the labor relations board must consider in determining the appropriateness of a bargaining unit, and a decision in that regard falls within its particular field of expertise. In re Liquor Control Department Non-supervisory Employees, 135 Vt. 623, 383 A.2d 612 (1978).

      Any interested person may file with the Board a charge that employees eligible to vote in an election under this chapter have been coerced or restrained in the exercise of this right.
    The Board shall investigate and conduct hearings into the validity of the charge.

        Memorandum issued to employees by the Department of Corrections did not merely restate existing standards, but set new disciplinary standards by prohibiting conduct not previously prohibited by the collective bargaining agreement and work rules, and by attaching likely disciplinary outcomes to both new and existing prohibited conduct; additionally, the memorandum unilaterally defined and broadened the circumstances under which employees could expect progressive discipline to be bypassed. Thus, the Labor Relations Board properly found that the Department had committed an unfair labor practice by interfering with employee rights and breaching its duty to bargain in good faith. Vt.

       <p>
        In excluding certain admissions by a grievant on the ground that the State had violated a provision of the collective bargaining agreement requiring that the grievant be notified of his right to have a union representative present, the Labor Relations Board did not adopt the exclusionary rule or the fruit-of-the-poisonous-tree doctrine, but rather analogized to those principles in considering the appropriate remedy in the case, taking into account the nature of the violation and the policy concerns underlying the violated provision. In so doing, the Board did not act beyond the scope of its authority. In re Grievance of Rosenberger, 185 Vt. 343, 970 A.2d 1257 (2009).

       <p>
        In a sex discrimination grievance filed by a female police officer, the findings were sufficient to support the Labor Relations Board's ultimate conclusion that grievant faced a hostile work environment. While not a case of outright and blatant discrimination based on gender, hostile environment cases seldom are. They are based upon the accretion of seemingly small incidents - of being criticized more harshly, scrutinized more closely, ridiculed for lack of aggression, or diminished for one's appearance, that in the aggregate create an environment of hostility and discrimination. In re Butler, 166 Vt. 423, 697 A.2d 659 (1997).

       </h5>
       <p>
        In a sex discrimination grievance filed by a female police officer, the Labor Relations Board's disparate treatment analysis was not flawed by the alleged comparison of grievant's conduct to persons and conduct that were not similarly situated, as the test is whether a prudent person, looking objectively at the incidents in question, would think them "roughly equivalent." In re Butler, 166 Vt. 423, 697 A.2d 659 (1997).

      1. Waiver of immunity.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     The provisions of this chapter for defense and indemnification of state employees in certain civil and criminal actions arising out of activities of the employee undertaken in the performance of official duties do not constitute a waiver of immunity for purposes of the eleventh amendment of the United States Constitution, which bars federal court jurisdiction over claims for damages brought directly against the state. Ragosta v. State, 556 F. Supp. 220 (D. Vt. 1981), aff'd without op., 697 F.2d 296 (2d Cir. 1982).

      2. Status of State.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     Obligation of state to defend state employees sued for acts or omissions done in their official capacity does not make a case against a state employee into a suit against the state, since under this chapter the state does not assume direct liability for the acts of employees; rather its status is analogous to that of an insurer. Libercent v. Aldrich, 149 Vt. 76, 539 A.2d 981 (1987).

        Private attorney who contracted with state defender general to represent indigent defendants at state's expense was not a state employee within meaning of statute, and he was thus amenable to civil malpractice liability. Reed v. Glynn, 168 Vt. 504, 724 A.2d 464 (1998).

        Although 3 V.S.A.
        §
        1101(b) does not specifically list public defenders or the defender general, executive and judicial branch employees are included within the definition of "state employee" and the statute uses the word "includes," which ordinarily signifies an intent to enlarge a statute's application, not to limit it. Bradshaw v. Joseph, 164 Vt. 154, 666 A.2d 1175 (1995).

        The enumeration of positions under 3 V.S.A.

        The plain meaning of the terms "action" and "suit" does not encompass an impeachment proceeding, which is a constitutionally established procedure before the legislature, at most quasi-judicial in nature; the terms connote the demand of a right in a court of justice or some tribunal as a condition precedent to giving a court jurisdiction of the subject matter.

         Caption of this section was relevant in determining the legislative intent, and it was essential that construction in light of the intention indicated by the caption not render this section ineffective or lead to irrational consequences. State v. Lynch, 137 Vt. 607, 409 A.2d 1001 (1979).
        </p>
        <p>
         In determining meaning of clause of this section referring to the advice and consent of the senate, the court must look to the intent of the legislature where the intent could be ascertained, which required the court to consider not only the letter of this section, but more importantly, its reason and spirit. State v. Lynch, 137 Vt. 607, 409 A.2d 1001 (1979).
        </p>
        <p>
         In this section, although the advice and consent clause was inartfully located, and though it could be construed such that "advice and consent" modified the word "serve" rather than the word "appointed," it would be held that the advice and consent clause did not limit the governor's removal powers and applied to appointments, not to removals.

         This section, being later in time of enactment than section 1873 of Title 20, providing that a governor may remove a commissioner of public safety upon charges preferred in writing and after hearing for certain specific grounds stated in that section, governed, as the statutes were in irreconcilable conflict and the more recent one was the latest expression of the legislative will.

      The General Assembly finds that a number of programs and tax credits have been established which encourage the development of businesses and jobs in the State of Vermont. The General Assembly also finds that some beneficiaries leave this State before the State derives any benefit from the assistance. Therefore, it is the public policy of the State of Vermont to recapture any benefits that it has granted to any business if, within a qualified period after the benefit was bestowed, that business decides to leave the State or to otherwise curtail its activity to a point lower than represented when the benefit was granted.

An opportunity for a fair hearing will be granted to any individual requesting a hearing because his or her claim for assistance, benefits, or services is denied, or is not acted upon with reasonable promptness; or because the individual is aggrieved by any other Agency action affecting his or her receipt of assistance, benefits, or services, or license or license application; or because the individual is aggrieved by Agency policy as it affects his or her situation.

    Whether the findings are made by the Board, or by a hearing officer and adopted by the Board, the Board shall enter its order based on the findings.

       After the fair hearing, the Board may affirm, modify, or reverse decisions of the Agency; it may determine whether an alleged delay was justified; and it may make orders consistent with this title requiring the Agency to provide appropriate relief including retroactive and prospective benefits.

    The Agency or the appellant may appeal from decisions of the Board to the Supreme Court under V.R.A.P. 13.

The Secretary shall either approve, modify, or reverse the Board's decision and order within 15 days of the date of the Board decision and order. If the Secretary fails to issue a written decision within 15 days as required by this subdivision, the Board's decision and order shall be deemed to have been approved by the Secretary.

       <p>
        Krupp findings, which are merely recitations of evidence, do not comply with the statutory obligation of the Human Services Board and the hearing officer to make findings of fact. Accordingly, reversal and remand for proper findings was required when the record consisted of such recitations. In re Rumsey, 192 Vt. 290, 59 A.3d 730 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a child-abuse-and-neglect registry case, remand was required because the Human Services Board failed to meet its obligation to issue written findings of fact. The Board's mere recitation of the evidence did not suffice. In re M.G., 189 Vt. 72, 13 A.3d 1084 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Human Services Board failed to meet its burden of demonstrating good cause for disapproving findings of hearing officer, where board offered no explanation as to why it did not adopt certain findings, but merely concluded that certain other findings established the child abuse charged. In re C.M., 168 Vt. 389, 721 A.2d 1176 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where human services board had a hearing officer conduct a hearing on application for medicaid benefits and the board neither demonstrated good cause for disapproving the findings of the hearing officer nor purported to disapprove any of the findings, the facts as found by the hearing officer were adopted by the board and constituted the record for supreme court review of the board's decision on the application. Pratt v. Department of Social Welfare, 145 Vt. 138, 482 A.2d 1389 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where findings of hearing officer appointed by the human services board to conduct a hearing on application for medicaid benefits overwhelmingly supported a conclusion that the applicant was medically disabled, but the board denied benefits based on improper testimony by a vocational expert about the medical nature of the applicant's case which was contradicted by medical evidence, since the board's order was not supported by the evidence and was based on speculation and conjecture rather than on the findings, it would be reversed and the cause remanded for determination and payment of appropriate benefits.

        </b>
        .
       </h5>
       <p>
        Human Services Board acted prematurely in reversing a substantiation decision by the Department for Children and Families (DCF) when the hearing officer ordered DCF to identify sufficient evidence to support a prima facie case before the proceedings would go forward, DCF challenged this ruling, and the Board upheld the hearing officer's authority to require such a showing. It should have then remanded the case to the hearing officer with direction to DCF that it had to comply with the order; DCF was entitled to the opportunity to comply with the Board's order. In re R.P. & B.P., 189 Vt. 31, 14 A.3d 278 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont Supreme Court rejects the suggestion that the statute governing Human Services Board hearings somehow limits the Board's authority to reach its own conclusion as to whether a report of abuse is substantiated. In re R.H., 189 Vt. 15, 14 A.3d 267 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute regarding Human Services Board hearings states, "The board shall consider, and shall have the authority to reverse or modify, decisions of the agency based on rules which the board determines to be in conflict with state or federal law." The sentence before this simply states the obverse of the prior statement, making clear that the Board does not have the power stated in the prior sentence if the Department for Children and Families (DCF) decision is in compliance with applicable law; it does not provide that the Board's review occurs on the record or the Board must give deference to DCF's finding. In re R.H., 189 Vt. 15, 14 A.3d 267 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the statutory scheme has changed since 1993, the burden remains with the Department for Children and Families (DCF) to justify its substantiation decision in the fair hearing before the Human Services Board. It remains true, therefore, that DCF's substantiation determinations are significantly different in nature from those of an adjudicative body. In re R.H., 189 Vt. 15, 14 A.3d 267 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislature intended human services board to hear any case in which an individual is aggrieved by department of social welfare action or policy that affects that individual. Stevens v. Department of Social Welfare, 159 Vt. 408, 620 A.2d 737 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        In modifying a decision of
    the Department of Social Welfare that was in conflict with federal disability law,
    Human Services Board acted as it is explicitly authorized to act under 3 V.S.A.

       <p>
        By reversing decision of department of social welfare which terminated appellees' benefits, board did not exceed its authority pursuant to provision of this section limiting its power to reverse agency decisions, it being within technical competence and expertise of board, through department, to correctly calculate benefits payments due, subject, of course, to appropriate appeal and review.

        The Human Services Board possessed discretionary authority to use dismissal as a discovery sanction, but it abused its discretion by dismissing claimant's appeal in the absence of conduct demonstrating bad faith or willful disregard of a discovery order.

        In reviewing the denial of a license by the department of social and rehabilitation services for operation of a community care home, disagreement by the human services board with the department's result was not sufficient basis, in itself, for reversal of that result. Huntington v. Department of Social & Rehabilitation Services, 139 Vt. 416, 430 A.2d 460 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where human services board, in reversing denial of a license by the department of social and rehabilitation services for operation of a community care home, found that violations of existing regulations which were assigned as grounds for denial of the license had occurred, but considered them insufficient basis for denial, it improperly exercised discretion and judgment entrusted by this section to the department.

        While demanding an offer of proof is not a power expressly conferred on the hearing officer or the Human Services Board by the Legislature, it is necessarily implied to enable the Board to carry out its sole statutory function - conducting fair hearings - effectively and efficiently. The Board has those powers expressly conferred upon it by the Legislature, together with such incidental powers expressly granted or necessarily implied as are necessary to the full exercise of those granted; the exercise of such authority is also consistent with the Board's rules.

       </p>
       <p>
        There was credible evidence supporting the findings of the Human Services Board, which reversed a decision by the Department of Disabilities, Aging, and Independent Living that reduced the service hours a disabled client received. The client's witnesses, a case manager and her physician, were more directly involved in her case and therefore more attuned to her individual needs, and their testimony tended to establish that if her service hours were reduced, she was at risk of more frequent hospitalizations and potential institutionalization; the Board had apparently given less weight to the testimony of the Department's witness, a clinical coordinator, because she did not actually meet with the client and made her recommendations based on an hour-long telephone conversation.

        Possibility that Medicaid applicant could face legal action to collect unpaid doctors' bills warranted application of equitable estoppel to prevent department of social welfare (DSW) from denying benefits, where applicant had asked DSW social welfare eligibility specialist if she should make payments on her outstanding doctors' bills, but had not been informed that if she spent down her excess resources on allowable medical expenses, she could be eligible for up to three months of retroactive benefits. Stevens v. Department of Social Welfare, 159 Vt. 408, 620 A.2d 737 (1992).

        Where human services board found that Medicaid applicant had $2,411.28 in outstanding doctors' bills when she spoke with social welfare eligibility specialist from department of social welfare (DSW) who told her not to make payments until a disability determination was made and further found that applicant did not pay those bills, conclusion that applicant did not rely on conduct of DSW was erroneous. Stevens v. Department of Social Welfare, 159 Vt. 408, 620 A.2d 737 (1992).

        Where social welfare eligibility specialist from department of social welfare (DSW) had sufficient facts to know that spend-down provisions under which Medicaid applicant could receive retroactive benefits would apply if applicant were determined to be disabled, but failed to inform applicant of spend-down provisions, DSW could be equitably estopped from denying retroactive benefits.

        In some cases, payments by the department of social welfare under section 3101 of Title 33, requiring payment of burial expenses, may help to defray the funeral expenses paid by the relatives of a deceased person when they arrange for burial, but this does not make relatives recipients of assistance or benefits under this section. Vigario v. Department of Social Welfare, 140 Vt. 100, 436 A.2d 768 (1981).

        Where relative of decedent who was entitled to benefits under section 3101 of Title 33, providing for payment of burial expenses by department of social welfare, instituted claim for reimbursement of expenses which she had incurred in connection with burial of decedent, since she was not entitled to payment under that section, she was not an applicant for assistance or benefits within the meaning of this section, and, therefore, the human services board lacked jurisdiction to hear her claim. Vigario v. Department of Social Welfare, 140 Vt. 100, 436 A.2d 768 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under section 3101 of Title 33, providing for payment of burial expenses for persons receiving certain forms of public assistance or lacking sufficient funds to pay for their own funerals, the only parties eligible to receive payments from the department of social welfare were funeral directors and towns required to arrange for burials for persons without assets; daughter of person eligible for payment of funeral expenses by department could not receive payments under that section and, therefore, was not an applicant entitled to a hearing on claim for funeral expenses by human services board under this section. Vigario v. Department of Social Welfare, 140 Vt. 100, 436 A.2d 768 (1981).

         10. Review by Secretary
        </b>
        .
       </h5>
       <p>
        When the Human Services Board's decision directly implicated the application of deductions for personal care expenses under Vermont's Medicaid laws, the Secretary of the Agency of Human Services was well within his authority to review this matter. In re Brett, 189 Vt. 345, 19 A.3d 154 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        When there was credible evidence supporting the findings of the Human Services Board, which reversed a decision by the Department of Disabilities, Aging, and Independent Living that reduced the service hours a disabled client received, the Secretary of the Agency of Human Services was required by statute to adopt its findings. The Department's decision was not owed deference by the Board; rather, the Secretary and the Court were to defer to the Board's findings. In re Ryan, 184 Vt. 597, 958 A.2d 678 (mem.) (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        The secretary must uphold the board's findings if the record contains any credible evidence that fairly and reasonably supports its findings. Jacobus v. Department of PATH, 177 Vt. 496, 857 A.2d 785 (mem.) (July 29, 2004).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Even for administrative adjudicative bodies that hear evidence and make findings of fact, a member can participate without offending the requirements of due process of law or general statutory requirements by voting after reviewing a transcript of the testimony and other evidence or listening to a recording of the hearing and reviewing other evidence. The Human Services Board's governing statute does not prohibit this practice and particularly does not require that votes be taken only at a meeting of the Board; such a practice is more clearly available to the Board because it relies upon hearing officers to take evidence and make findings, and the Board functions in part as an appellate body. In re Rumsey, 192 Vt. 290, 59 A.3d 730 (2012).

        Petitioners, whose grandson had been adjudicated a child in need of care or supervision, were not entitled to a hearing before the Human Services Board as the fact that the Department for Children and Families was compelled by statute to assess relatives before informing the Family Division of their willingness and ability to assume temporary legal custody of a child did not make petitioners "recipients of social services" under the statute governing hearings before the Board.

      NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT I, James H. Douglas, by virtue of the power vested in me as Governor of the State of Vermont, do hereby establish the Governor's Jobs Cabinet:
     </p>
     <p>
      The Jobs Cabinet shall consist of representatives from State agencies and departments and shall include representatives from outside state government.
    The State members shall include the Development Cabinet and the Commissioners of the Departments of Labor and Industry, Employment and Training, and Public Service; the Manager of the Vermont Economic Development Authority; the Chancellor of the Vermont State Colleges or his or her designee; and the President of the University of Vermont or his or her designee.
    There shall be thirteen non-State members appointed by the Governor to serve for terms of three years.
    The initial appointments of the non-State members shall include four one-year terms, four two-year terms and five three-year terms.
    The Governor shall appoint the Chair.
    The Jobs Cabinet may, at its discretion, establish inter-agency work groups to support its mission, drawing membership from any agency or department of state government.
     </p>
     <p>
      Administrative support to the Cabinet shall be provided by the Agency of Commerce and Community Development.
    Public members may receive reimbursement of expenses in attending Cabinet meetings and may receive a per diem pursuant to <cite class="vt-code">32 V.S.A. § 1010</cite>. The Jobs Cabinet shall meet at the call of the Chair to carry out the following responsibilities:
     </p>
     <p>
      1) Work collaboratively to identify and meet the needs of job generators and remove impediments to job growth whenever practicable.
     </p>
     <p>
      2) Open dialogue and establish strategic partnerships among government and key organizations to achieve the goal of greater job creation.
    The Jobs Cabinet and individual state agencies may refer specific job development projects that present complex and unique issues or require interagency coordination among state agencies and departments to the Chair.
    The Chair may establish a working group consisting of the State members for review and development of a plan to coordinate the state agencies involved and resolve interagency conflicts, if any, to insure a coordinated and common sense approach.
     </p>
     <p>
      3) Maintain an ongoing review of the state's permitting processes and make recommendations that will assist business and housing to grow responsibly within a regulatory scheme that is fair, predictable, expedient, and cost-conscious. The Chair, in his or her sole discretion, may refer any proposed project that will create additional jobs through expansion or location in Vermont to a working group consisting of State members for review.
    The working group may, to the extent practicable and according to applicable laws, identify those aspects of the project where assistance in coordinating interagency communication, permitting or regulatory processes would assist review of the project in an efficient, reasonable and timely fashion.
    The Chair, in his or her sole discretion, may refer a job development project to the Jobs Cabinet that has failed or chosen not to expand or locate in Vermont for review and identification of factors, including but not limited to, infrastructure needs, state workforce deficiencies, and regulatory requirements, that contributed to the decision not to expand or locate in Vermont.
    The working group shall report to the full Jobs Cabinet a summary of the projects it has considered and the factors identified as significant to the decision.
     </p>
     <p>
      4) Remove barriers to and develop incentives for critical infrastructure investment in the State that is conducive to job creation such as broadband, wireless and power.
     </p>
     <p>
      5) Facilitate small business advocacy forums in each region of the state to create an inventory of the needs of small business, including but not limited to government assistance.
     </p>
     <p>
      6) Research programs in other states, particularly competitors in the Northeast, to identify Vermont's opportunities and weaknesses relative to those states, recommend where Vermont should focus its efforts, and develop strategies to improve Vermont's competitive position in those areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      7) Research and closely monitor national and international business trends to help Vermont's economic development strategy stay ahead of its competitors.
    Identify emerging markets or potential growth areas such as exporting, technology, biotech, and engineering and design appropriate recruiting strategies for those industry sectors.
     </p>
     <p>
      8) Proactively seek to retain existing Vermont businesses and encourage job growth by developing networks for marketing and purchasing while creating links to other businesses for service and collaborative action.
     </p>
     <p>
      9) Create and support a culture of entrepreneurship where new enterprise and innovation, especially within the high-tech industry, require private capital to grow and thrive.
     </p>
     <p>
      10) Continuously seek ways to capitalize on Vermont's key natural resources such as granite, wood, marble and agriculture with substantial consideration to value added products.
     </p>
     <p>
      11) Encourage the creation, rehabilitation, and preservation of housing that is affordable to working Vermonters.
     </p>
     <p>
      12) Encourage the reuse of buildings, manufacturing facilities and other infrastructure in our traditional downtown areas.
     </p>
     <p>
      13) Assure that the State's efforts, and those of this Jobs Cabinet, to maintain and create new jobs recognize the importance of assuring Vermont's environmental heritage and ethic, and that the quality of our environment will support the goals of the Jobs Cabinet, and that a strengthened economy will benefit the State's ability to protect the environment.
     </p>
     <p>
      14) Advise the Governor on the effectiveness of this Order on job creation and retention in Vermont.

      WHEREAS, the Department of Human Resources has provided official notice to the Vermont State Employees Association ("VSEA") and affected employees that 80 state employees who worked at the Vermont State Hospital ("VSH") in Waterbury will be separated from state service effective April 13, 2012;
     </p>

      WHEREAS, The Governor, the House, and the Senate have all worked diligently to support and protect these employees and will work to provide as many opportunities for state employment as is mutually possible.
     </p>
     <p>
      NOW THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED THAT I, Peter Shumlin, by virtue of the power vested in me as Governor, do hereby establish and order as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       I. Mitigation of the impact of the reduction in force to affected employees.
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       A. The Job Offer Program:
      </b>
      The Department of Human Resources and VSEA negotiated a pre-RIF jobs program that permits Vermont State Hospital employees to receive mandatory offers of employment to other positions in the Agency of Human Services prior to any actual reduction in force (the Job Offer Program). As part of the Job Offer Program, the Department of Human Resources hosted several informational meetings and a day-long event where employees could meet with recruitment counselors to get additional information about the program and the potential jobs available.
    (To date, 41 employees elected to participate in the program and 11 found new employment in the Agency of Human Services.)
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       B. Reemployment Rights, Benefits, and Trainings for Vermont State Hospital Employees Subject to the Reduction in Force:
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      a.
    The Department of Human Resources will hold a number of meetings at which information concerning reemployment rights, retirement options, benefits continuation, the employees' assistance program, unemployment insurance and job training opportunities will be addressed.
    The Department of Human Resources will hold job fair meetings for impacted employees to provide information about existing job openings and assist employees with applying for these jobs.
     </p>
     <p>
      b.
    The Vermont Department of Labor will assist the Department of Human Resources by identifying available federal and state training funds and grant opportunities to assist with skill assessment, job retraining, job development, on-the-job and apprenticeship programs, and other reemployment assistance to the affected employees.
     </p>
     <p>
      c.
    The Departments of Human Resources and Labor will coordinate to hold job fair meetings for impacted employees to provide information about existing job openings and assist employees with applying for those jobs.
     </p>
     <p>
      d.
    The Administration is committed to working diligently with the VSEA to place VSH employees subject to the RIF in jobs within state government in accordance with the terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreements.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       C. Mandatory Job Offers to Employees Who Continue to Work for State Government:
      </b>
      The Department of Human Resources also worked with the VSEA to address the rights that Vermont State Hospital employees may have for reemployment at any successor State Hospital.
    The Department and VSEA negotiated language that is included in H.630 to give any VSH employee subject to the RIF, but later rehired by state government, the opportunity to return to their prior job when the new state hospital opens, subject to seniority and other contract rights and obligations.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       D. Mandatory Job Offers to Employees Who Leave State Government and Wish to Return:
      </b>
      In addition, for displaced employees who take jobs outside state government, the proposed language extends reemployment rights under the collective bargaining agreements until one year after the opening of the successor facility.
    In this way, VSH employees who are no longer employed by state government will have reemployment possibilities at any successor hospital.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       E. Posting of Job Openings:
      </b>
      The Department of Human Resources shall post all open positions that involve providing care to individuals with mental health conditions that are provided to the Department by participating hospitals developing inpatient, secure residential, and intensive residential recovery services.

     <p>
      WHEREAS, Vermonters with criminal records suffer from discrimination in many areas of life, including employment opportunities;
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, state government is committed to modeling fair hiring practices for all Vermont employers;
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, too many Vermonters with criminal records are unable to successfully re-enter their communities due to lack of employment and self-sufficiency;
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, Vermonters with criminal records represent a workforce with skills to contribute and a desire to add value to their communities;
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, studies indicate that stable employment is one of the best predictors of post-conviction success;
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, employment of those with criminal records promotes public safety and cost-containment by significantly reducing the risk of recidivism and incarceration;
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, a "ban the box" hiring policy increases the opportunity of applicants with criminal records to explain their circumstances while preserving employers' ability to ultimately conduct a criminal background check as part of the hiring process;
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, such a policy removes questions related to a job applicant's criminal record in the initial stage of many employment applications, thereby preventing the conviction from serving as an immediate reason for screening out an applicant when the conviction may have little or no bearing on the work to be performed;
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, states across the country have adopted hiring practices to remove unfair barriers to employment of people with criminal records; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, to maximize compliance with federal anti-discrimination law, recommends delaying inquiry of a job applicant's conviction history and considering the job-relatedness of the conviction.
     </p>
     <p>
      NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED that I, Peter Shumlin, by virtue of the power vested in me as the Governor of the State of Vermont, do hereby order and direct that the Department of Human Resources create and implement a "ban the box" hiring policy that encourages job applications from all motivated, hardworking, and otherwise qualified people, regardless of a person's criminal record.
    Such a policy shall provide qualified applicants the opportunity to explain a criminal record when applying for state positions, but shall not affect positions for which a criminal conviction makes a candidate ineligible regardless of the circumstances.

     </p>

      WHEREAS, both the financial and human costs of homelessness strain public services including health care, mental health care, and education;
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, as federal housing resources have declined, affordable housing production in Vermont has slowed and homelessness has increased;
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, Vermont has a commitment to the quality of life for all of its citizens, including through the launch of a statewide initiative to end child and family homelessness in Vermont by 2020;
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, State investments targeted to Vermonters experiencing homelessness - including the Vermont Rental Subsidy, Family Supportive Housing, Housing Opportunity Program, and Subsidy and Care Program - have shown effectiveness at breaking the cycle of homelessness;
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, housing partners such as the Vermont State Housing Authority, the Vermont Housing Finance Agency, and the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board have targeted and coordinated resources to create supportive housing opportunities for Vermonters who are homeless;
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the 2015 annual point-in-time count showed a modest decrease in homelessness statewide, and housing partners across Vermont should commit to building on successes to date; and
     </p>

      WHEREAS, in addition to increasing access to affordable housing, success in ending homelessness requires a coordinated continuum of supports and services including Short-Term Emergency Shelter, Targeted Transitional Housing, Rental Subsidies, Targeted Homelessness Prevention Activities, Rapid Re-Housing, and Supportive Housing.
     </p>
     <p>
      NOW, THEREFORE BE IT RESOLVED I, Peter E. Shumlin, by virtue of the power vested in me as Governor, do hereby establish a goal that owners of publicly funded housing make available at least 15% of their affordable housing portfolio to homeless families and individuals, including those with special needs who require service support and rental assistance to secure and maintain their housing.
     </p>
     <p>
      To implement this goal, I hereby direct that:
     </p>
     <p>
      1.
    Housing organizations and homeless service providers that receive state funds, state-allocated grants, and/or state tax credits shall work together to coordinate rental subsidies, services, and economic support such that, when publicly supported housing units become available, homeless families and individuals have the assistance and support needed to make use of those units.
    These organizations are encouraged to adopt Memoranda of Understanding or other mechanisms as tools to plan for achievement of this goal.
     </p>
     <p>
      2.
    To ensure that homeless Vermonters have both the necessary supports and affordable housing to achieve success, the Agency of Human Services ("AHS") shall prioritize and coordinate services and subsidies to homeless families and individuals, and shall encourage recipients of AHS grants to work together with housing partners to meet the 15% goal.
     </p>
     <p>
      3.
    Public housing authorities and owners of privately owned publicly supported affordable housing are encouraged to work towards the goal of making at least 15% of their units available to homeless families and individuals as units change hands and are developed.
     </p>
     <p>
      4.
    The Vermont Community Development Program ("VCDP"), the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board ("VHCB"), and the Vermont Housing Finance Agency ("VHFA") shall work together to develop funding criteria that requires applicants for housing grants or tax credits to describe plans and tools to achieve the goal of making at least 15% of their permanent, publicly supported housing units available to the homeless. These funding criteria shall apply to all applicants for housing grants or tax credits, subject to limited exceptions. Applicants will also be asked to describe any "non-permanent" assistance, such as shelter beds or transitional housing units.
    VCDP, VHCB, and VHFA shall report annually to the Agency of Commerce and Community Development and AHS on the results of this effort.
     </p>
     <p>
      5.
    AHS shall provide training to housing managers and housing and homeless service providers on how to successfully work with formerly homeless households.
     </p>
     <p>
      6.
    State agencies and housing agencies are encouraged to seek new sources of federal and philanthropic funding for housing development, services and subsidies.
     </p>
     <p>
      7.
    In working towards the 15% goal, owners of age-restricted housing shall not be required to make units available to individuals who do not meet their age restrictions.

      those addicted to opioids must be afforded adequate and effective treatment and recovery opportunities; and

     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, in order to fully enable and empower local communities in their fight against opioid addiction and abuse and to build on the success of Project VISION, there is a need to ensure full coordination among State agencies, State municipalities, law enforcement, and treatment providers to strengthen Vermont's overall response to the opioid crisis through effective opioid addiction prevention, treatment, recovery and enforcement action plans.

     <p>
      "Appearance of a Conflict of Interest" means the impression that a reasonable person might have, after full disclosure of the facts, that an Appointee's judgment might be significantly influenced by outside interests, even though there may be no actual Conflict of Interest.
     </p>

       II. General Conduct.
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      An Appointee must conduct the affairs of their office in such a manner as to instill public trust and confidence in the integrity of State government.
    Further, Appointees have a responsibility to act as examples and set a civil and respectful tone in the public discourse.
     </p>
     <p>
      A. Thus, an Appointee shall always, and without exception, be honest, helpful and fully committed to the principle that all authority is derived from the people, and therefore, all officers of government, whether legislative or executive, are servants of the people and at all times, in a legal way, accountable to them. [VT. Const., Ch I, Article 6]
     </p>
     <p>
      B. Appointees shall take all reasonable steps to avoid any action or circumstances, including acts or circumstances which may not be specifically prohibited by this Code, which might result in:
     </p>

      <li id="t03p02c03s3-84ol11">

      </li>
      <li id="t03p02c03s3-84ol111">
       Appointees are strongly encouraged to engage in electronic communications regarding official business only on their official email accounts.
    If private accounts must be used, Appointees shall copy their official e-mail accounts on all such outgoing communications and forward any received messages on which their official emails are not copied. If substantive discussion (not otherwise documented) relating to the work of the Public Body occurs on a text-messaging system, such discussion is to be copied to a separate public record format (such as by copying the relevant text messages to the appointee's official e-mail).
      </li>
      <li id="t03p02c03s3-84ol112">
       Email messages and other electronic data produced or acquired in the course of the business of the Public Body is considered a public record subject to disclosure under the Vermont Public Records Act, regardless of whether the record resides in a State-provided system or a private account; provided, however, solely for purposes of this subsection, "public body" does not include councils or similar groups established by the Governor for the sole purposes of advising the Governor with respect to policies.

     </p>
     <p>

     <p>
      G. Every Full-Time Appointee shall devote his or her worktime to the duties of his or her office.

     </p>
     <p>
      Exemptions sought under this Code shall be issued only to further the twin goals of this Code: 1) to establish high standards of ethical conduct for all Appointees and 2) to encourage those Vermonters best qualified to serve in State government.

      The purpose of this questionnaire is to determine any significant personal interests of Appointees that might conflict with the best interests of the state.

This form is intended to identify those interests and provide assurance that conflicts of interest will not impair fair and impartial state actions. Appointees must avoid Conflicts of Interest and, where they do occur, must disclose them to the Secretary of Civil and Military Affairs.

     <p>
      <b>
       II. Charge and Process.
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Task Force is hereby ordered to undertake the following three projects in the following order of priority:
     </p>
     <p>
      1. Evaluate structures of support for racially diverse populations, particularly in light of the disparities in health outcomes highlighted by COVID-19:
     </p>
     <p>
      a. Structures that currently exist in Vermont;
     </p>
     <p>
      b. Models that have succeeded in other jurisdictions;
     </p>
     <p>
      c. Policy changes Vermont should consider or efforts the state can promote;
     </p>
     <p>
      d. Tools the state can provide to communities;
     </p>
     <p>
      e. Language access; and
     </p>
     <p>
      f. Economics, housing, healthcare and access to credit.
     </p>
     <p>
      2. Review current state and federal law on hate speech and freedom of speech and consider:
     </p>
     <p>
      a. Changes to state law that would facilitate prosecuting harassment, hate speech and other bias-motivated crimes; and
     </p>
     <p>
      b. Changes to State law necessary to ban Confederate flags or other similarly incendiary flags/images from being displayed in places that receive state funding. If all such proposed changes are determined by the Task Force to be highly likely to be found by a state or federal court to unconstitutionally restrict speech, after consultation with experts in constitutional law, the Task Force shall identify the entity most appropriate to conduct training and education in this regard.
     </p>
     <p>
      3. Study and present options for encouraging Vermonters from diverse, marginalized, or underrepresented racial and ethnic groups to run and serve in public office at all levels (local, state, including boards and commissions and federal). The Task Force shall determine:
     </p>
     <p>
      a. Who, or what, organization(s) should conduct the training;
     </p>
     <p>
      b. Whether there is grant funding available to support this effort; and
     </p>
     <p>
      c. Whether there is a program in Vermont or elsewhere that could be replicated.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Task Force shall be advisory to the Governor and make recommendations on the first Project by August 15, 2020. The Task Force shall also provide advice as needed by the Governor. Preliminary recommendations on Projects 2 and 3 shall be submitted to the Governor by December 15, 2020.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Task Force shall meet as needed and at least monthly. Meetings of the Task Force will be public and shall be held electronically for the duration of the COVID-19-related state of emergency and for so long thereafter as the Task Force deems practicable. The Task Force shall ensure notice of the meetings is received in different geographic regions of the State in order to encourage public participation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Task Force shall receive administrative and staff support from the Office of the Governor and the Agency of Administration.
     </p>
     <p>
      To the extent funding is available, each member of the Panel shall be entitled to per diem compensation pursuant to <cite class="vt-code">32 V.S.A. § 1010</cite>.

      WHEREAS, Vermonters deserve a modern government providing efficient and effective services, including exemplary customer service and reasonable expectations; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the work of the Governor's Cabinet over the last four years has highlighted the fact that Vermont's diversity of statutes, rules and regulatory programs to encourage economic growth, improve our roadways, facilitate the work of our farmers in times of increasing economic stress, develop our outdoor recreation infrastructure and protect our natural resources, environment and public health often require complex and overlapping permitting and approval processes in an environment of highly politicized competing policy and resource demands; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, coordinated support for both existing enterprises and new and expanded commercial opportunities are critical to Vermont's economic prosperity and workforce growth needed to sustain educational and health and human services for Vermont's most vulnerable; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, it is unfortunate many perceive our system of permitting and approvals to be so cumbersome, complex, time-consuming and expensive they would rather risk non-compliance; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, key to the support needed by Vermonters are permitting and approval processes that are rational and navigable; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, optimizing total permitting time, modernizing and coordinating permitting processes and better utilizing technology to improve both oversight and efficiency, will benefit both Vermonters and Vermont's environment; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, continuously improving programs and processes is important, and ensuring that staff have the knowledge and skills to be able to do so effectively is crucial to meeting the ever-changing needs of Vermonters; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, it is essential my Cabinet members use the continuous improvement skills we have developed to ensure greater collaboration and coordination across programs, departments and agencies to improve the customer experience of Vermonters while securing the environmental outcomes required in law and rule.
     </p>
     <p>
      NOW THEREFORE, I, Philip B. Scott, by virtue of the authority vested in me as Governor of the State of Vermont, do hereby direct as follows:

Members of the MDT shall immediately develop a charter for approval by the Chair, acting on behalf of the Cabinet members. The MDT shall meet every week or as needed to streamline the permitting and approval processing for outstanding projects. The MDT shall be chaired by the lead representative from the Agency of Commerce and Community Development. The MDT shall have the direct support of the Project Manager.

      1. Key Performance Indicators ("KPI") for the functioning of the permitting system, to include estimated total permitting time, and how those KPIs shall be made available to all Vermonters;
     </p>
     <p>
      2. The creation of a common entry system into the permitting process;
     </p>
     <p>
      3. The integration of existing and new permitting workflows into the Business Portal currently being upgraded by the Agencies of Commerce and Community Development and Digital Services together with the Office of the Secretary of State;
     </p>
     <p>
      4. The development or procurement of a Customer Relationship Management ("CRM") tool and how a CRM might be used in relationship to permitting interactions with the State of Vermont;
     </p>
     <p>
      5. An evaluation of current and needed communications tools, including the permitting handbook, websites, best practice guides, outreach to municipalities, and other steps that should be included in the Permitting Modernization Plan;
     </p>
     <p>
      6. An assessment of current permitting staffing and existing volumes of applications to make any necessary recommended changes; and
     </p>
     <p>
      7. An evaluation of various state databases; how the data in each can more effectively communicate with another, and what changes are necessary.
     </p>
     <p>
      C. The Plan shall articulate all necessary short-, medium-, and long-term actions, create a timeline for achieving those steps, and recommend any immediate legislative action for steps which cannot otherwise be performed under the existing authority of the Governor or an Executive Branch agency.

     <p>
      I, Philip B. Scott, by virtue of the authority vested in me as Governor of Vermont by the Constitution of the State of Vermont Chapter II, Section 20, the general powers set forth in <cite class="vt-code">20 V.S.A. § 8</cite> and <cite class="vt-code">20 V.S.A. § 366</cite> and having determined that the necessity of public service requires it, hereby order and direct the Adjutant General of Vermont to order into Active State Service, for the purpose of assisting and supporting the State of Vermont, in its efforts to respond to the conditions created or caused by COVID-19 in order to alleviate hardship and suffering of citizens and communities and in order to preserve the lives and property of the State, any and all units of the National Guard of the State of Vermont as he, in consultation with the Department of Public Safety/Vermont Emergency Management (DPS/VEM), may deem appropriate to carry out the purposes of this Order.
     </p>
     <p>
      National Guard assistance is a direct result of the need for additional vaccination and other recovery services following the termination of the statewide COVID-19 Declaration of Emergency issued March 13, 2020 as amended and restated, and which expired by its terms June 15, 2021.
     </p>
     <p>
      It is hereby FURTHER ORDERED:
     </p>
     <p>
      1.
      <b>
       State Agency Coordination.
      </b>
      For purposes of continued operations for COVID-19 recovery, all agencies of the State shall use and employ state personnel, equipment and facilities or perform any and all activities consistent with the consensus and direction of the Vermont Department of Health (VDH) and DPS/VEM. Policy adoption or changes related to responding to or recovering from COVID-19 shall require approval of the Governor.
     </p>
     <p>
      2.
      <b>
       VDH Commissioner Oversight.
      </b>
      With oversight provided by the Secretary of the Agency of Human Services (AHS), the Commissioner of VDH shall oversee COVID-19 related investigation and mitigation efforts for the duration of this Order. All local boards of health shall consult with and abide by the recommendations of the Commissioner of VDH prior to taking any action regarding isolation or quarantine of an individual(s). Town health officers shall work with and assist VDH as directed by the Commissioner of VDH. Changes in public health mitigation measures or requirements impacting the general population shall require approval of the Governor.

      <b>
       Non-Congregate Housing and Emergency Feeding Programs.
      </b>
      While the COVID-19 Declaration of Emergency has expired, many of its impacts continue on economically disadvantaged Vermonters, especially women, children and minority populations. Effective as of March 1, 2020 state agencies statewide shall:
     </p>
     <p>
      a. To the extent not already in place, and at the discretion of AHS, arrange for placement of current clients and vulnerable populations in alternative non-congregate housing solutions for the purpose of providing adequate social distancing as needed.
     </p>
     <p>
      b. To the extent not already in place, implement a temporary voluntary quarantine and isolation program utilizing non-congregate solutions including hotels, motels, dormitories or other forms of non-congregate shelter for current clients and vulnerable populations for the purpose of providing adequate social distancing between all individuals who are reasonably believed to have been exposed to or infected with COVID-19, or recovering from COVID-19. To the extent they determine the need for non-congregate temporary housing to quarantine and temporarily isolate first responders including Department of Corrections personnel, health care workers and others critical to the COVID-19 response, such as critical infrastructure construction and maintenance, who are at reasonable risk of having been exposed to or are infected with COVID-19, or are recovering from COVID-19, and cannot return to their usual residence because of the risk of infecting other household members, provide alternative non-congregate housing to this population of first responders, health care workers and others critical to the COVID-19 response.
     </p>
     <p>
      c. To the extent AHS determines there is a need to provide non-congregate housing to the general public for the purpose of minimizing the impact of outbreaks and exposure to COVID-19 among family units and vulnerable populations in the same household, such non-congregate housing shall be offered.
     </p>
     <p>
      d. To the extent not already in place, and at the discretion of AHS, arrange for placement of current clients and vulnerable populations in alternative non-congregate housing solutions for the purpose of providing adequate social distancing as needed.
     </p>
     <p>
      e. To the extent AHS determines there is a need, provide feeding programs to minimize the continuing impact of food insecurity among Vermonters affected by COVID-19.

      JOINT STATEMENT OF INTENTIONS
     </p>
     <p>
      At the invitation of Governor Madeleine M. Kunin, the Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet Kuzma F. Filatov and a delegation from the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic of the USSR visited the State of Vermont, of the United States of America, from the 5th to the 9th of September, 1989.
     </p>
     <p>
      Included in the delegation were the First Deputy Chairman of the Council of Ministers Lenian P. Kitsa, the Vice Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet Vladislav V. Petukhov, Deputy Education Minister Valentina P. Makara and Vladimir G. Prozorov, chief of the English faculty of the Karelian Pedagogical Institute and interpreter of the delegation.
     </p>
     <p>
      The delegation's visit was in return for the visit of Governor Kunin and a delegation from the State of Vermont to the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, November 27-December 1, 1988.
     </p>
     <p>
      Chairman of the Presidium Filatov and the Karelian delegation visited Montpelier September 6, conferred with members of the Legislature, inspected a variety of industries, educational and health establishments and acquainted themselves with daily life in Vermont.
     </p>
     <p>
      The visit of the Soviet guests reinforced the conviction of both sides that a new constructive dialogue and openness is developing in relations between the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics as a result of the decision of President Ronald Reagan and General Secretary Mikhail S. Gorbachev at their 1985 summit meeting to encourage people-to-people exchanges.
     </p>
     <p>
      Both sides confirmed their desire to encourage friendly ties, develop contacts between counterpart organizations and institutions, and encourage businesslike relations between the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic and the State of Vermont on the basis of equality and mutual benefit.
     </p>
     <p>
      Both sides, recognizing differences in their historic development, express their desire to enter into greater dialogue and mutual understanding in the interest of peace.
     </p>
     <p>
      Both sides jointly declared that a state of friendship exists, in practice, between the State of Vermont and the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic, and that a foundation has been laid for the creation of sister-state relations between the State of Vermont and the Karelian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic.
     </p>
     <p>
      Both sides agreed to encourage and develop exchanges, official as well as unofficial, between the Republic and the State. These would involve short-term exchanges of citizens, teachers, students, local and state officials and others.

     <p>
      1.

     <p>
      3. Once the Secretary notifies the State of Vermont that it is eligible to receive federal assistance under the Program, the Board is authorized to borrow funds from a lending institution, provided that the loan is guaranteed by the Secretary and that the loan proceeds are used exclusively to implement and effectuate the policies and purposes of the Vermont Housing and Conservation Trust Fund Act;
     </p>
     <p>
      4. During Vermont's participation in the Program, the Board shall work with the General Assembly, the State Treasurer, municipalities, foundations, nonprofit corporations, businesses and private parties to set the amount of assistance the State of Vermont will make available in State/private assistance for acquiring interests in land to protect and preserve important farmlands for future agricultural use so that the State of Vermont will continue to be eligible for federal assistance under the Program;
     </p>

      WHEREAS, mercury is a persistent and toxic pollutant that has accumulated in Vermont's environment, especially in aquatic environments; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, most of Vermont's mercury contamination comes from large generators of air pollution located in upwind regions of the country; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, this pollution is harmful to health and the environment; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, consumption of certain fresh and salt water fish above the state's fish consumption advisory levels may pose a health risk, especially to young children and women of child bearing age because of mercury pollution; and

     <p>
      WHEREAS, Vermont's fish-consuming wildlife are also threatened from mercury contamination; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, approximately one third of Vermont's impaired waters are impaired because of air deposition of mercury; and

      WHEREAS, Vermont and other New England States and the Eastern Canadian Provinces support the virtual elimination of mercury from the environment; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, Vermont and other New England States agreed to approaches to obtain reduction of air deposition of mercury, including litigation against sources of that pollution; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, one additional source of mercury contamination in the environment is the release of mercury from numerous types of consumer products including thermometers, lamps, thermostats, medical instruments, and numerous products containing mercury switches (such as autos, pumps and gauges) when they are disposed of or broken; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, mercury-free or low mercury alternative products exist for many consumer products containing mercury; and

      NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED THAT I, HOWARD DEAN, by virtue of the power vested in me as Governor, do hereby order state agencies, departments and offices.
     </p>
     <p>
      1.
    To eliminate the purchase of products that contain mercury where mercury-free alternatives exist at reasonable cost and comparable performance to mercury-added products.
     </p>
     <p>
      2.
    Where such mercury-free alternative products do not exist, I order that preference be given to the purchase of products with the lowest total mercury content feasible (and documented as such) and products that bear a mercury content warning label as required of product manufacturers under Vermont law.
     </p>
     <p>
      3.
    These practices shall be reflected in the administrative purchasing policies of the state no later than July 1, 2002 and in all new contracts issued after the effective date of this order.

      WHEREAS, in 1999, pursuant to Sec. 87a of No. 1 of the Acts of 1999, the State of Vermont participated in the purchase of approximately 133,000 acres of land in Vermont's Northeast Kingdom; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the appropriation of $4,500,000 was to be "used to purchase and ensure that the lands commonly referred to as the Champion lands in northeastern Vermont are conserved as a working forest for the sustainable production of wood products, for natural resources, including the maintenance of wildlife habitat and conservation of identified natural heritage sites, and for perpetual public access for traditional recreational uses"; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the former Champion lands now consist of approximately 84,000 acres of working forest, subject to both a working forest and a public access easement owned by the State of Vermont and the Vermont Land Trust to ensure that the land is perpetually managed for the sustainable growth and harvesting of timber and is perpetually open for public access; approximately 22,500 acres of state-owned land, the West Mountain Wildlife Management Area, conserved for perpetual public access and its fish, wildlife and ecological values; as well as approximately 26,500 acres of land held by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service as a Silvio Conti National Fish & Wildlife Refuge; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, this land purchase, in which Vermont's contribution equaled less than a fifth of the total purchase price, has guaranteed Vermonters' access to these lands forever; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, dialogue and clear assurances will allow us to move forward to ensure that the complex land deal that granted Vermonters so much is appreciated by Vermonters for its value and is protected forever.
     </p>
     <p>
      NOW THEREFORE, I, Howard Dean, M.D., through the power vested in me as Governor of the State of Vermont, do hereby order as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      1.
    The West Mountain Wildlife Management Area (WMWMA) that was acquired by the state of Vermont as part of the so-called Champion land deal pursuant to Sec. 87a of No. 1 of the Acts of 1999, and that is a portion of the so-called Champion lands, is a wildlife management area, and as such it will be managed by the Vermont Department of Fish and Wildlife or its successor agency or department.
     </p>
     <p>
      2.
    All of the approximately 22,500 acres of the WMWMA shall be conserved for lawful and perpetual public access for traditional recreational uses, including boating, fishing, trapping, snowshoeing, skiing, bird watching, hiking, and hunting (including training and using hunting dogs).
    The Department of Fish and Wildlife shall allow snowmobiling, bicycling, and equestrian uses in designated corridors.
     </p>
     <p>
      3.
    The Department of Fish and Wildlife shall manage the WMWMA so as to retain road access to within two statute miles of any point within the WMWMA.
     </p>
     <p>
      4.
    The Department of Fish and Wildlife shall manage the WMWMA both for natural resource protection and wildlife, including active management to support both game and non-game species.
     </p>
     <p>
      5.
    The Department of Fish and Wildlife shall actively monitor the health, size, and distribution of selected populations of game and non-game species found in the WMWMA.
    Concurrently, the Department of Fish and Wildlife and the Department of Forests, Parks and Recreation shall monitor forest conditions of critical habitats including the habitat composition, condition, and health of bear-scarred beech stands, black bear wetland feeding areas, vernal pools, and white-tailed deer wintering habitat.
    These departments shall report their findings at the opening of each biennium to the legislative committees on institutions, natural resources and energy, and fish, wildlife and water resources, or any successor committee or committees.
     </p>
     <p>
      6.
    Prior to the implementation of any changes to the management of WMWMA, and prior to the adoption of any new management plan for the WMWMA, the Department of Fish and Wildlife shall report to the legislative committees on institutions, natural resources and energy, and fish, wildlife, and water resources, or any successor committee or committees, with regard to those changes and those new plans.
     </p>
     <p>
      7.
    From the date of the execution of this Executive Order, if the Department of Fish and Wildlife intends to change or alter any present traditional recreational use of the WMWMA land or to amend or modify the management plan on the WMWMA, the Department shall inform the legislative committees on institutions, natural resources and energy, and fish, wildlife, and water resources, or any successor committee or committees, of that intent in writing and through personal testimony, if invited by said committees to so testify, by the end of the month of January in any year in which the Department intends to institute changes or alter any present use.
    An emergency situation of a non-recurring nature necessitating Department action is exempt from the provisions of this paragraph, but information about the emergency action taken must be included in the next year's report to the legislative committees listed above.
    At the time of the emergency, the Commissioner will notify the chairs of the committees referenced above regarding the nature of the emergency and the steps taken to address the emergency.
     </p>
     <p>
      8.
    By this order a Citizen Oversight Council is created to assist in implementing the provisions of this order and the provisions of the Champion land transaction in the northeastern region of Vermont as authorized by the 1999 session of the general assembly.
    The council shall function as a forum to hear and attempt to resolve concerns involving the so-called Champion lands that are brought to the attention of the council regarding ongoing use and management of state lands, collaboration with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, and public access to the public and privately held lands.
    With respect to the public lands and the role of the Agency of Natural Resources (ANR) and its constituent departments, these matters may include: public access; the recreation access plan; snowmobiling and other motorized, mechanical, and equestrian access; private roads; temporary restrictions; federal ownership; timber harvesting; wildlife management; land conservation; water classification; and economic development.
    The council has no authority to discuss or comment on interests obtained by a private owner who purchases a portion of the property, including timber harvesting and forest management interests obtained.

     <p>
      WHEREAS, a Tiger Team comprised of a skilled group of state employees with solid financial and analytical skills was formed to profile and review key financial data of Vermont's affordable housing delivery system and to suggest and explore opportunities to enhance the efficiency of the system; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, five statewide entities serving state government, including the Vermont Housing Finance Agency ("VHFA"), the Vermont State Housing Authority ("VSHA"), the Housing Foundation, Inc. ("HFI"), the Vermont Housing and Conservation Board ("VHCB"), and the Department of Economic, Housing, and Community Development ("DEHCD"), and at least twelve non-profit housing organizations, have as their primary purpose the common mission of serving the affordable housing community; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the five statewide entities employ over 130 employees, including three executive directors, a commissioner, and supporting staff, and consist of four separate Boards with 37 individual board members; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the five statewide entities often collaborate to provide funding to the same affordable housing projects, especially through Vermont's non-profit affordable housing network; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the five statewide entities' net assets are largely comprised of loan receivables held by VHFA and VHCB; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the viability of Vermont's affordable housing delivery system is dependent upon preserving the economic value of receivables created by investments of Vermont taxpayers and maximizing the direct benefit of these investments to Vermonters seeking affordable housing; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the Tiger Team observed that the current design and implementation of the state's affordable housing delivery system may foster a level of undue complexity and duplication of efforts, resulting in greater administrative costs and less direct investment in the construction and maintenance of affordable housing; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the Tiger Team observed that operating and personnel expenditures for non-profit housing organizations has increased substantially greater than the rate of inflation for the period 2005-2008; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the Tiger Team observed that changes to housing policy may result in increased revenue that could be used for investment in more affordable housing; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the Tiger Team's review concluded that a 10% savings in administrative costs within the five statewide entities alone would result in approximately $900,000 annually in direct investment in affordable housing, which could generate $20 million or more in additional investments in affordable housing if leveraged over a 30 year term and preserve the financial value of past capital investments in affordable housing; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, further review of the state entities' affordable housing delivery system is warranted given the substantial resources currently dedicated to funding that system and the potential for savings and efficiencies.
     </p>
     <p>
      NOW, THEREFORE, I, James H. Douglas, by virtue of the power vested in me as Governor, do hereby direct the Commissioner of the Department of Economic, Housing, and Community Development to convene the necessary resources and stakeholders, as he shall deem necessary, to explore the redesign of, and business process improvements to, the state affordable housing delivery system to achieve savings and efficiencies which shall be used to make additional direct investment in affordable housing.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Commissioner shall, in consultation and conjunction with VHFA, VSHA, HFI, VHCB, and DEHCD:
     </p>
     <p>
      1.
    Conduct an in-depth review of the existing organizational structures and business processes of the five state affordable housing entities and make recommendations to improve their effectiveness and increase efficiencies;
     </p>
     <p>
      2.
    Recommend and procedures to ensure loan receivables held by the state affordable housing entities are managed in a fiduciary-oriented manner to ensure these substantial assets are available as a current and future resource for additional investments in affordable housing; and
     </p>
     <p>
      3.
    Provide a written report to the Governor and to the General Assembly no later than September 1, 2010 containing all findings and recommendations to achieve the purposes of this Executive Order.
     </p>
     <p>
      This Executive Order shall take effect upon execution and shall expire upon delivery of the written report to the Governor and the General Assembly.

     </p>

      A.
    That the jurisdictional trigger for trails enrolled in the Vermont Trail System is the jurisdictional trigger that applies to the construction of improvements for municipal, county, and state purposes in <cite class="vt-code">10 V.S.A. § 6001(3)(A)</cite>(v). (Meaning a VTS trail project will require 10 acres or more of actual land disturbance to trigger Act 250 jurisdiction, regardless the size of the parcel(s) the trail may cross).
     </p>
     <p>
      B.
    That the involved land for determining jurisdiction over trails enrolled in the Vermont Trail System includes only those portions of any tract or tracts of land to be physically altered or upon which construction of improvements will occur as more fully described in Act 250 Rule 2(C)(5)(b). (Meaning land not used as a part of the VTS trail improvements will not be considered when determining whether a VTS trail project triggers Act 250 jurisdiction).
     </p>
     <p>
      C.
    That once Act 250 jurisdiction is triggered, that jurisdiction only extends to the trail corridor
    and
    to
    any
    area directly
    or
    indirectly
    impacted
    by
    the construction, operation, or maintenance of the trail corridor. (Meaning when Act 250 asserts jurisdiction over a VTS trail project, jurisdiction will only apply to the trail corridor and will in no way restrict or encumber lands outside the trail corridor on the parcel(s) the trail may cross).

These recommendations should also provide applicants clarity on how recreational trails can be constructed and operated in a manner that does not result in an undue or adverse impact to the human or natural communities where they are located. The report shall include recommendations for revisions to 10 V.S.A. chapter 20, including revisions to mapping, legislative authority to administer the program, potential funding sources, staffing needs, and whether to include other recreational trails. The recommendations should include any proposed changes to legislation to promote the construction and operation of trails in an environmentally protective manner.

     <p>
      WHEREAS, it is desirable to reorganize the agencies, departments and divisions of government by better coordinating certain activities and improving the coordination and effectiveness of services to the public; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, Act 250 has operated under the same administrative structure for over fifty years, consisting of District Environmental Commissions ("District Commissions"), administrative tribunals comprised of three volunteer members of the public, operating independently in 9 regions of the State; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, from 1970 through 2004, the former Environmental Board oversaw the operations of the District Commissions and established policy precedents across the Act 250 enterprise through the issuance of decisions in appeals of Act 250 permits; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, when the Natural Resources Board replaced the Environmental Board in 2004, the Natural Resources Board did not retain its ability to compel consistent application of policy and law across the nine District Commissions through the issuance of decisions in Act 250 appeals; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, while Act 250 has served Vermont well, the scope and complexity of environmental, planning, and regulatory issues District Commission must consider has expanded significantly since 1970; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, with complex emerging issues such as climate change, the interplay between Act 250 and other state and municipal regulatory programs, demographic challenges, and the growing economic divide between the rural and urban parts of our state, and with a current governance structure that lacks a unifying policy authority across the nine districts, restructuring Act 250 presents an opportunity to maximize natural resource protections, enable well planned growth, increase predictability and reduce redundancy with other state regulatory programs; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, a professional Natural Resources Board that decides major cases will have the capacity to consider and manage complex issues now and into the future, and, through their Orders, will establish precedent and policy resulting in the consistent application of Act 250 criteria statewide; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, in each proceeding of the restructured Natural Resources Board, two members from the District Commission from the District where the proposed project is located will sit with the Natural Resources Board so regional considerations will continue to inform Act 250 decisions.
     </p>
     <p>
      NOW THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me as Governor by the Constitution of the State of Vermont, Chapter II, Section 3 and Section 20, 3 V.S.A. chapter 41 and <cite class="vt-code">32 V.S.A. § 704a</cite>, I, Philip B. Scott, do hereby reorganize the Natural Resources Board and its District Commissions as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      1. As of July 1, 2021, a restructured Natural Resources Board made up of three full-time professional members is hereby created to professionalize and modernize the current governance structure, to unify policy authority across the nine District Commissions, to maximize natural resource protections, to enable well-planned growth, to increase predictability and uniformity and reduce redundancy and inconsistency with other state regulatory programs.
     </p>
     <p>
      2. As of July 1, 2021, the Natural Resources Board created in <cite class="vt-code">10 V.S.A. § 6021</cite> consisting of five members appointed by the Governor (the "Original Board") is hereby abolished and all the duties, responsibilities and authority of the Original Board are hereby transferred to a reconstituted Natural Resources Board made up of three full time professional members as established in Section 3 below.
     </p>
     <p>
      3. As of July 1, 2021, the Natural Resources Board shall consist of three full-time professional voting members which shall have all the duties, responsibilities, and authority of the Original Board and such duties, responsibilities and authority as set forth in this Order.
     </p>
     <p>
      The members shall include a Chair and two additional members who shall be appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate. In making these appointments, the Governor and the Senate shall give consideration to experience, expertise or skills relating to the environment or land use, as well as geographic, gender, ethnic and racial diversity. Following initial appointments, the three members shall serve six-year staggered terms.
     </p>
     <p>
      Initial appointments shall be made prior to July 1, 2021. For initial appointments, the Chair shall be appointed to a six-year term, one member shall be appointed to a four-year term and the third member shall be appointed to a two-year term. Each of the three members shall be a full-time employee, exempt from the classified service, serving at the pleasure of the Governor.
     </p>
     <p>
      When a particular application comes before the Board, two members from the District Commission from the District where an application being reviewed was located shall become voting members of the Board solely with respect to that matter. The two District Commission members shall be selected by the applicable Chair of the District Commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      4. As of July 1, 2021, the authority of each of the District Commissions in <cite class="vt-code">10 V.S.A. § 1084(b)</cite>, to determine whether a complete application shall be processed as a major application with a required public hearing or a minor application, shall be transferred to the Natural Resources Board, acting without District Commissioners.
     </p>
     <p>
      5. As of July 1, 2021, the authority of each of the District Commissions to determine whether to issue an administrative amendment shall be transferred to the Natural Resources Board, acting without District Commissioners.
     </p>
     <p>
      6. As of July 1, 2021, all authority of each of the District Commissions in Title 10 relating to any application determined to be a major application or a minor application where a hearing is requested, shall be transferred to the Natural Resources Board.
     </p>
     <p>
      7. As of July 1, 2021, the provisions of Title 10 and the rules, policies and procedures of the Natural Resources Board relating to applications determined to be major applications or minor applications where a hearing is requested shall be deemed to refer to and shall be applicable to the Natural Resources Board.
     </p>
     <p>
      8. An applicant who has received a Jurisdictional Opinion from a District Coordinator may, within 30 days from the issuance of the opinion, request reconsideration of the Jurisdictional Opinion by the Natural Resources Board, acting without the District Commissioners.
     </p>
     <p>
      9. All complete applications filed with a District Commission prior to July 1, 2021 shall remain under the jurisdiction of the applicable District Commission until resolution of the application.
     </p>
     <p>
      This Executive Order shall be submitted to the General Assembly pursuant to <cite class="vt-code">3 V.S.A. § 2002</cite>. This Executive Order shall take effect on April 15, 2021, unless disapproved by both houses of the General Assembly.

     </h3>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, upon deactivation of the members of the Vermont Army National Guard after World War I, the company funds of various units comprising the First Infantry Regiment, Vermont National Guard, were turned over to the federal government, more specifically the War Department (the forerunner of the Department of Defense);
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, in 1927, the War Department returned the company funds to the Adjutant General for the Vermont Army National Guard, Brigadier General Herbert T. Johnson, to benefit the present and future elements of any reconstituted and/or reactivated regiment;
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, in 1927, the Honorable John E. Weeks, Governor of the State of Vermont, by special order 54, dated 21 June 1927, created a special committee to review the receipt of these funds and to make recommendations;
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, on 30 June 1927, upon the recommendation of the special committee, the Governor established the 172d Infantry Memorial Trust Fund;
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the 172d Infantry constituted the reorganized units of Vermont National Guard units that served in World War I;
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, on 1 July 1960, the fund was redesignated by Executive Order (no number) of the Honorable Robert T. Stafford, Governor of the State of Vermont, as the "Vermont Army National Guard Memorial Trust Fund;"
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, as of this date, the "Vermont Army National Guard Trust Fund" is still a functional fund but with the changes in the force structure over the last 40 years, there is a need to revise the fund.
     </p>
     <p>
      NOW THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that I, Howard Dean, by virtue of the power vested in me as Governor, do hereby reconstitute the "Vermont Army National Guard Memorial Trust Fund" as the "Vermont National Guard Trust Fund" (hereinafter referred to as the "Trust") and establish a Trust Fund Board with the duties and responsibilities as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      1. The Trust will be for the benefit of all members of the Vermont National Guard.
     </p>
     <p>
      2. The Trust Fund Board will be chaired by the Adjutant General for the State of Vermont, and be comprised of the Deputy Adjutant General for the State of Vermont, the Vermont Army National Guard Assistant Adjutant General, and the Air National Guard Assistant Adjutant General.
    A majority of the sitting members shall constitute a quorum and action taken by the board under the provisions of this Executive Order may be authorized by a majority of members present and voting at any regular or special meeting.
    The members of the board will not receive any remuneration for their participation on the board except for the reimbursement of reasonable business expenses and/or operational costs.
     </p>
     <p>
      3. The Trust Fund shall be administered by the board and effectuate the policies and purposes of this Executive Order. Deposits to the currently existing monies shall be made to the fund from moneys appropriated thereto by the general assembly from time to time and from any other source, private or public, as approved by the board.
    Unexpended balances and any earnings shall not revert to the general fund but shall remain in the fund for use in accord with the purposes of this Executive Order.
     </p>
     <p>
      4. The original purpose of the Fund was to benefit the members of the Vermont National Guard in time of federal activation during an emergency and, in keeping with that purpose, the fund will continue to be used for members of the Vermont National Guard in times of federal activation during emergencies, war, rebellion, humanitarian effort, operations other that war and in times of state active duty.
    The board will establish rules and regulations governing the expenditure of funds under these conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      5. In further keeping with the original intent of the fund, the Board may disburse part of fund as a discretionary fund to be used for the purpose of the betterment of the members of the Vermont National Guard.
    But under no circumstance will this allocation and disbursement reduce the total fund to an amount lower than $30,000, an amount to be used for the purposes stated in paragraph 4 above.
     </p>
     <p>
      6. The Fund, principle and interest, will be invested and reinvested in commercially reasonable investment vehicles as approved by the Board.
     </p>
     <p>
      7. If the Board deems necessary, the Board may contract with and/or hire investment consultants, brokers, counselors, or the like and the cost therefore, will be borne by the fund.
     </p>
     <p>
      This Executive Order shall take effect upon signing.

      WHEREAS, on October 8, 1999, Governor Howard Dean reconstituted the fund as the "Vermont National Guard Trust Fund" and established the Trust Fund Board;
     </p>
     <p>
      NOW, THEREFORE, I, Peter Shumlin, by virtue of the power vested in me as Governor, do hereby amend the duties and responsibilities of the Trust Fund Board as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       I. Composition, Appointments, and Process.
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Trust Fund Board shall be chaired by the Adjutant General for the State of Vermont, or his/her designee.
    The Adjutant General shall appoint members to the Board and shall appoint not less than three members.
    A majority of the sitting members shall constitute a quorum and action taken by the Board under this Executive Order may be authorized by a majority of members present and voting at any regular or special meeting. The members of the board will not receive any remuneration by the State of Vermont for their participation on the Board.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       II. Charge.
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The Board shall administer the Trust Fund and effectuate the policies and purposes of this Executive Order.
    Deposits to the currently existing monies shall be made to the Fund from moneys appropriated thereto by the General Assembly from time to time and from any other source, private or public, as approved by the Board.
    Unexpended balances and any earnings shall not revert to the general fund but shall remain in the fund for use in accord with the purposes of this Executive Order.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Trust will be for the benefit of all members of the Vermont National Guard.
     </p>
     <p>
      The original purpose of the Fund was to benefit members of the Vermont National Guard in times of federal activation during an emergency and, in keeping with that purpose, the Fund will continue to be used for members of the Vermont National Guard in times of federal activation during emergencies, war, rebellion, humanitarian effort, operations other that war and in times of state active duty. The Board will establish rules and regulations governing the expenditure of funds under these conditions.
     </p>
     <p>
      In further keeping with the original intent of the Fund, the Board may disburse part of the Fund as a discretionary fund for the purpose of betterment of the members of the Vermont National Guard.
    Under no circumstance will this allocation and disbursement reduce the total Fund to an amount lower than $30,000, to be used for the purposes stated in the preceding paragraph.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Fund, principle and interest, will be invested and reinvested in commercially reasonable investment vehicles as approved by the Board.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the Board deems necessary, the Board may contract with and/or hire investment consultants, brokers, counselors, or the like and the cost therefore, will be borne by the Fund.

     <p>
      WHEREAS, since December 2019, Vermont has been working in close collaboration with the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and with the United States Health and Human Services Agency to monitor and plan for the potential for an outbreak of respiratory illness due to a novel coronavirus (a disease now known as COVID-19), in the United States; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, this rapidly evolving global situation required the Governor to direct the Vermont Department of Health (VDH) to activate the Health Operations Center in February 2020 when VDH began to monitor and later, test Vermonters who may have been exposed to COVID-19; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, in March 2020, the Governor directed Vermont Emergency Management (VEM) to assemble an interagency taskforce, and later to activate the Vermont State Emergency Operations Center (SEOC), in accordance with the State Emergency Management Plan, to organize prevention, response, and mitigation efforts and share information with local and state officials; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, on March 7, 2020 and March 11, 2020, VDH detected the first two cases of COVID-19 in Vermont; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, on March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, we now know that while most individuals affected by COVID-19 will experience mild flu-like symptoms, some individuals, especially those who are elderly or already have severe underlying chronic health conditions will have more serious symptoms and require hospitalization; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, both travel-related cases and community contact transmission of COVID-19 have been detected in the region and this transmission is expected to continue; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, if no mitigation steps are taken, COVID-19 would likely spread in Vermont at a rate similar to the rate of spread in other states and countries, and the number of persons requiring medical care could exceed locally available resources; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, it is critical we take steps to control outbreaks of COVID-19, particularly among those who are elderly or already have underlying chronic health conditions, to minimize the risk to the public, maintain the health and safety of Vermonters, and limit the spread of infection in our communities and within our healthcare facilities; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, Vermonters must come together as we have before in a crisis, to do our part to protect the very ill and elderly by preventing and slowing the spread of this virus and ensure those who experience the most severe symptoms have access to the care they need.

     </p>
     <p>
      18.
    To ensure that workers affected by COVID-19 have access to wage replacement programs, I hereby direct the Department of Labor to extend unemployment insurance to those Vermonters following the instructions of their healthcare providers to self-isolate or quarantine; to remove the work search requirement for those workers affected by temporary closure of a business; and to temporarily suspend any mechanisms that would delay the release of funds to claimants.

     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, after receiving updated recommendations from the CDC, social distancing and mitigation efforts recommended by the Vermont Department of Health, and in consultation with neighboring states for a regional approach, the Governor has determined it is necessary to close all bars and restaurants statewide through April 6, 2020, although food service establishments may continue to offer takeout and delivery service; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, it is important for all Vermonters to recognize additional reductions or prohibitions may be implemented as needed to the extent there is a growing trend of confirmed COVID-19 in Vermont.

     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the Executive Order expressly recognized the critical need to take steps to control outbreaks of COVID-19, particularly among those who are elderly or already have underlying chronic health conditions, to minimize the risk to the public, maintain the health and safety of Vermonters, and limit the spread of infection in our communities and within our healthcare facilities; and

      WHEREAS, after receiving updated recommendations from the U.S. Surgeon General and the U.S. College of Surgeons, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid, and in consultation with the Commissioner of the Department of Health and the Vermont Association of Hospitals and Health Systems, the Governor determined it was necessary to suspend all non-essential adult elective surgery and medical and surgical procedures, including dental procedures, pursuant to Addendum 3 to the Executive Order as of March 20, 2020, in order to help protect patients, reduce exposure to healthcare providers and preserve PPE; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the Governor, in consultation with the Commissioner of the Department of Health and representatives of Vermont healthcare providers, has determined a limited resumption of outpatient services, including clinic visits, diagnostic imaging and limited outpatient surgeries and procedures is appropriate at this time.

      If the Commissioner of the Vermont Department of Health has determined that a COVID-19 outbreak has occurred and providers cannot safely care for Vermonters in a way that (1) limits the exposure of patients and staff to COVID-19; (2) preserves PPE and ventilators; and (3) preserves inpatient hospital capacity, it will notify and require all providers in the region to return to the standards set out in Addendum 3 to the Executive Order. Depending on the severity of the outbreak, the Vermont Department of Health may require all Vermont providers to return to those standards.
     </p>
     <p>

     </p>
     <p>
      [Stay Home/Stay Safe: Restart Phase VI]
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, on March 7, 2020 and March 11, 2020, the Vermont Department of Health (VDH) detected the first two cases of COVID-19 in Vermont and almost two months later Vermont has experienced over 900 cases and over 50 related deaths; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, on Friday, March 13, 2020, the Governor issued Executive Order 01-20, Declaration of State of Emergency in Response to COVID-19 and National Guard Call-Out ("Executive Order"), declaring a state of emergency for the State of Vermont in response to COVID-19; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the Executive Order expressly recognized the critical need to take steps to control outbreaks of COVID-19, particularly among those who are elderly or already have underlying chronic health conditions, to minimize the risk to the public, maintain the health and safety of Vermonters, and limit the spread of infection in our communities and within our healthcare facilities; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, consistent with Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines regarding social distancing, and in consultation with the Commissioner of the Department of Health (VDH), the Governor has directed a number of mitigation strategies for the State in order to protect individuals at risk for severe illness; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, after consultation with the Commissioner of the Department of Health, the Governor determined it was necessary to require Vermonters to stay home and to limit travel to essential activities only, and suspend the operation of all non-essential businesses and non-profit governmental services pursuant to Addendum 6 to the Executive Order as of March 24, 2020 (Stay Home/Stay Safe), in order to help reduce the spread of COVID-19; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, modeling studies done for the State clearly show that, but for the mitigation measures taken to date, the number of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths in the State and the region would be having a much more devastating effect on Vermonters and would be threatening to overwhelm the capacity of the Vermont health care system; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the Governor has undertaken a cautious, incremental and evidence-based approach to restarting Vermont's economy and continues to do so with a limited reopening of retail businesses.
     </p>
     <p>
      NOW THEREFORE, I, Philip B. Scott, by virtue of the authority vested in me as Governor of Vermont by the Constitution of the State of Vermont, the emergency powers set forth in <cite class="vt-code">20 V.S.A. §§ 8</cite>, 9 and 11 and other laws, hereby authorize the Secretary of the Agency of Commerce and Community

    and
    procedures for the limited, incremental and phased resumption of business, non-profit and government entity operations which had previously been determined to be non-critical services under Stay Home/Stay Safe, effective Monday, May 18, 2020. The limited, incremental, and phased resumption of business, non-profit and government entity operations shall begin with non-essential retail; and mitigation requirements and procedures issued by the Secretary shall require implementation of appropriate occupancy limits and physical distancing, health and sanitation and training measures.
     </p>
     <p>
      1.
    The Secretary of the Agency of Commerce and Community Development (ACCD), in consultation with the Commissioner of VDH, and with the approval of the Governor, may, from time-to-time, authorize additional limited, incremental, and phased resumption of business, non-profit and government entity operations and update and modify the mitigation requirements and procedures regarding the resumption of business, non-profit and government entity operations.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the Commissioner of the VDH has determined that a COVID-19 outbreak has occurred and businesses and non-profit and government entities cannot safely operate in a way that 1) limits the exposure of customers and staff to COVID-19 and 2) does not threaten to overwhelm our hospitals and healthcare resources, he is hereby authorized, with approval of the Governor, to notify and require any or all businesses and non-profit and government entities to return to certain standards of operation.
     </p>
     <p>
      2.
    Businesses and non-profit and government entities deemed critical in accordance with Addendum 6 to the Executive Order and ACCD Sector Guidance (Stay Home/Stay Safe), may continue to operate under pre-existing guidance and shall operate in accordance with mandatory health and safety and training requirements issued by ACCD.
     </p>
     <p>
      3.
    All businesses and not-for profit and government entities are encouraged to continue business strategies, procedures and practices to maximize use of on-line presence, telephone and web-based service delivery and phone or online orders for term curb-side pick-up and delivery.

     </p>
     <p>
      This Amendment to Addendum 6 to the Executive Order shall take effect upon signing and, except as amended hereby, Addendum 6 to the Executive Order, shall continue in full force and effect until midnight on May 15, 2020, at which time the Governor, in consultation with the Vermont Department of Health and the Department of Public Safety/Division of Emergency Management shall assess the emergency and determine whether to amend or extend Addendum 6, as amended.

     </p>
     <p>

     </p>
     <p>

      <b>
       Health and Safety Requirements.
      </b>
      The State shall undertake a phased approach to reopen the economy, balancing the need to restore and strengthen our overall social and economic wellbeing with the prevention of a resurgence of COVID-19 that would undermine or lose the important public health outcomes achieved to date.

      [Work Smart & Stay Safe - Restart VT: Phase III]
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, on March 7, 2020 and March 11, 2020, the Vermont Department of Health (VDH) detected the first two cases of COVID-19 in Vermont and almost two months later Vermont has experienced over 860 cases and over 45 related deaths; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, on Friday, March 13, 2020, the Governor issued Executive Order 01-20, Declaration of State of Emergency in Response to COVID-19 and National Guard Call-Out ("Executive Order"), declaring a state of emergency for the State of Vermont in response to COVID-19; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the Governor, in consultation with VDH and the Vermont Agency of Human Services, has initiated aggressive and sustained efforts to protect property and public health, and to ensure public safety in this public health emergency including issuing Addenda to the Executive Order to limit in-person contact, such as limiting the size of gatherings, closure of schools and the institution of remote learning through the end of the school year, suspending the operation of close contact businesses, requiring telecommuting and work from home, requiring Vermonters to stay home and stay safe with exceptions for essential purposes and suspending the operation of businesses which are not deemed critical; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, modeling studies done for the State clearly show that, but for the mitigation measures taken to date, the number of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths in the State and the region would be having a much more devastating effect on Vermonters and would be threatening to overwhelm the capacity of the Vermont health care system; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the Governor has undertaken a cautious, incremental and evidence-based approach to restarting Vermont's economy; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, as we move forward, businesses, governments and employees must understand that
      how
      they work is essential to resuming and maintaining business operations, to stay safe and save lives.
     </p>
     <p>
      NOW THEREFORE, I, Philip B. Scott, by virtue of the authority vested in me as Governor of Vermont by the Constitution of the State of Vermont, the emergency powers set forth in <cite class="vt-code">20 V.S.A. §§ 8</cite>, 9 and 11 and other laws hereby order as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      1.
      <b>
       Health and Safety Requirements.
      </b>
      The State shall continue a phased approach to reopen the economy, balancing the need to restore and strengthen our overall social and economic wellbeing with the prevention of a resurgence of COVID-19 that would undermine or lose the important public health outcomes achieved to date. As previously established in Addendum 11 to the Executive Order, in order to achieve this balance, all businesses and non-profit and government entities, including employees and contractors of government entities, which are operating or will be operating during the declared State of Emergency, shall implement the following physical distancing, health and sanitation measures in accordance with Vermont Department of Health, CDC and Agency of Commerce and Community Development (ACCD) guidelines:
     </p>
     <p>
      a. Employees shall not report to, or be allowed to remain at, work or job site if sick or symptomatic (with fever, cough, and/or shortness of breath).
     </p>
     <p>
      b. Employees must observe strict social distancing of six feet while on the job. Businesses and non-profit or government entities shall ensure customers observe strict social distancing of six feet while on location, to the extent possible.
     </p>
     <p>
      c. Employees must wear face coverings over their nose and mouth when in the presence of others. In the case of retail cashiers, a translucent shield or "sneeze guard" is acceptable in lieu of a mask.
     </p>
     <p>
      d. Employees must have easy and frequent access to soap and water or hand sanitizer during duration of work, and handwashing or hand sanitization should be required before entering, and leaving, job sites. All common spaces and equipment, including bathrooms, frequently touched surfaces and doors, tools and equipment, and vehicles must be cleaned and disinfected regularly.
     </p>
     <p>
      e. No more than two people shall occupy one vehicle when conducting work.
     </p>
     <p>
      f. Prior to the commencement of each work shift, pre-screening, including temperature checks and health survey shall be required to verify each employee has no symptoms of respiratory illness (fever, cough, and/or shortness of breath). At the present time non-contact thermometers are in short supply, however employers shall immediately order, and use their best efforts to obtain, thermometers in order to conduct routine temperature checks.
     </p>
     <p>
      g. Signs must be posted at all entrances clearly indicating that no one may enter if they have symptoms of respiratory illness.
     </p>
     <p>
      h. No congregation of employees shall be permitted on site.
     </p>
     <p>
      i. No workers who have knowledge of contact with a worker who is diagnosed with COVID-19 shall be permitted on site and shall quarantine for 14 days.
     </p>
     <p>
      j. Indoor workspaces where more than 2 employees are working must have good air circulation.
     </p>
     <p>
      k. All operations shall designate a health officer on-site at every shift responsible for ensuring compliance with the Executive Order and the Addenda thereto and applicable ACCD Guidance. This person shall have the authority to stop or modify activities to ensure work conforms with the mandatory health and safety requirements.
     </p>
     <p>
      l. All employees, including those already working (except healthcare workers, first responders, and others already trained in infection control, personal protection/universal precautions), must complete, and employers must document, a mandatory training on health and safety requirements as provided by VOSHA, or another training program that meets or exceeds the VOSHA-provided standard.
     </p>
     <p>
      2.
      <b>
       Enhanced Training Requirements.
      </b>
      On April 27, 2020, Vermont Occupational Safety and Health Agency (VOSHA) developed a minimum level of health and safety training to be completed by all employees and documented by businesses and non-profit and government entities in operation, no later than May 4, 2020. VOSHA has undertaken the preparation of translated versions of the training, and those employees and employers who require translated versions shall have an additional week from the date of release of the translation to complete and document the training. VOSHA training establishes a minimum standard for training which will not be sufficient for all businesses and non-profit and government entities to reopen safely during the COVID-19 pandemic.
     </p>
     <p>
      Except as set forth below, employers, or industries, trade associations, chambers of commerce or similar representative organizations acting on behalf of employers, shall adopt a training program prior to reopening. In many cases, this will require a plan that augments the VOSHA training standards with additional policies and procedures customized to the unique nature of the entity or sector-specific employment environment. Consideration shall be given to the ability of a particular industry sector or business or non-profit or government entity to deliver goods or services in a manner that does not put either employees or the public at risk of exposure to the COVID-19 virus during an outbreak.
     </p>
     <p>
      Augmented plans should assess the need to:
     </p>
     <p>
      ì
      Adopt a phased approach to reopening which provides sufficient opportunity to operate first in a low density and low contact environment before making the incremental changes needed to accommodate more moderate density activity while continuing to maintain health and safety.
     </p>
     <p>
      ì
      Update physical and administrative safety systems to accommodate COVID-19 VDH/CDC/VOSHA guidelines, health monitoring, including temperature checks, cleaning and sanitizing methods and physical distancing measures.
     </p>
     <p>
      ì
      Take appropriate measures to protect employees at greater risk of contact by virtue of their occupational role or setting.
     </p>
     <p>
      ACCD shall provide guidance and examples for developing health and safety training plans.
     </p>
     <p>
      All businesses and non-profit and government entities who have suspended operations for 7 or more days under Addendum 6 to the Executive Order (Stay Home/Stay Safe) shall have on file a health and safety training plan prior to reopening. The plan shall be made available to VOSHA or to any employee upon request.
     </p>
     <p>
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, businesses and non-profits and government entities with fewer than 10 employees at any one office or site of operation, may elect to implement the VOSHA training.
     </p>
     <p>
      3.
      <b>
       Customer and General Public Mask Use.
      </b>
      Customers and the public in general, are encouraged to wear face coverings over their nose and mouth any time they are interacting with others from outside their households. Businesses and non-profit and government entities may require customers or clients to wear masks.
     </p>
     <p>
      4.
      <b>
       Mask Use on Public Transit Conveyances or in Mass Transportation Facilities.
      </b>
      The traveling and commuting public shall wear face coverings over their nose and mouth any
    time they are using public transportation conveyances, including busses, trains and ride services and when in a mass transportation station or terminal, including airports.
     </p>
     <p>
      5.
      <b>
       Phased Restart.
      </b>
      Preventing outbreaks and limiting the spread of COVID-19 is the only way to avoid future business and social disruption. The success of this phased restart will depend in large part on the ability of employers and employees to adhere to the public health, safety, and social distancing measures essential to limiting the spread of illness.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subject to compliance by all affected businesses and non-profit and government entities with the health and safety requirements set forth above and ACCD guidance developed in consultation with VDH and the Department of Public Safety/Division of Emergency Management, Phase 3 of this effort, effective May 4, 2020, will allow the following:
     </p>
     <p>
      a. Small crews of no more than ten (10) persons per location/job, to perform outdoor work and construction work in unoccupied job sites. An unoccupied job site may be a single unit in a commercial or residential structure. "Unoccupied," may include sites vacated for the duration of the construction work.
     </p>
     <p>
      b. Manufacturing and distribution operations may resume with a maximum of ten (10) employees in any location if they are low-density and ensure employees are at least six feet apart at all times.
     </p>
     <p>
      c. Supporting operations may continue with the minimum number of employees necessary to support curbside pick-up and delivery services, and in accordance with the guidance issued by ACCD.
     </p>
     <p>
      6.
      <b>
       Manufacturing, construction, and distribution operations.
      </b>
      Subject to (1) compliance with the health and safety requirements set forth above and ACCD guidance and (2) the development of enhanced training programs as set forth above, effective May 11, 2020, manufacturing, construction, and distribution operations may restart with as few employees as necessary to permit full operations while continuing to maintain health and safety.
     </p>
     <p>
      7.
      <b>
       Education and Compliance.
      </b>

To keep disease from spreading this means:
     </p>
     <p>
      ì
      Always staying home and away from others if you are sick with COVID-19, have recently been exposed to someone who has COVID-19, or just don't feel well.

       Enhanced Training Requirements.

      Businesses and non-profit and government entities, with over 10 employees, which support or offer outdoor recreation and fitness activities, or trade associations, chambers of commerce or similar representative organizations acting on behalf of employers, shall adopt a health and safety training program prior to reopening. In many cases, this will require a plan that augments the VOSHA training standards with additional policies and procedures customized to the unique nature of the entity or sector-specific employment environment. Consideration shall be given to the ability of a particular industry sector or business or non-profit or government entity to deliver goods or services in a manner that does not put either employees or the public at risk of exposure to the COVID-19 virus during an outbreak. The plan shall be made available to VOSHA or to any employee upon request.
     </p>
     <p>
      Augmented plans should assess the need to:
     </p>
     <p>
      ì
      Adopt a phased approach to reopening which provides sufficient opportunity to operate first in a low density and low contact environment before making the incremental changes needed to accommodate more moderate density activity while continuing to maintain health and safety.
     </p>
     <p>
      ì
      Update physical and administrative safety systems to accommodate COVID-19 VDH/CDC/VOSHA guidelines, health monitoring, including temperature checks, cleaning and sanitizing methods and physical distancing measures.
     </p>
     <p>
      ì
      Take appropriate measures to protect employees at greater risk of contact by virtue of their occupational role or setting.
     </p>
     <p>
      ACCD shall provide guidance and examples for developing health and safety training plans.

     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, modeling studies done for the State clearly show that, but for the mitigation measures taken to date, the number of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths in the State and the region would be having a much more devastating effect on Vermonters and would be threatening to overwhelm the capacity of the Vermont health care system; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, as of April 17, 2020, the Governor began to undertake a phased approach set forth below, to reopen the economy, addressing the need to restore and strengthen the State's overall social and economic wellbeing while including measures for the prevention of a resurgence of COVID-19 that would undermine or lose the important public health outcomes achieved to date:
     </p>
     <p>
      ì
      Phase 1 set forth in Addendum 10 to the Executive Order issued April 17, 2020, which outlined principles and safety precautions for a phased restart of the Vermont economy, allowed small crews for outside construction or other outdoor trade jobs, and single-worker professional services and clarified guidance for retailers to allow additional operations using delivery and curbside service;
     </p>
     <p>
      ì
      Phase 2 set forth in Addendum 11 to the Executive Order issued April 24, 2020, which allowed an expansion of small crews for construction and resumption of manufacturing and distribution operations with small crews, in-person shopping at outdoor retail operations and farmers markets and offered clarity for library operations;
     </p>
     <p>
      ì

     </p>
     <p>
      ì
      Phase 4 set forth in an Amendment to Addendum 3 to the Executive Order issued May 4, 2020, which allowed for the phased restart of elective medical and surgical procedures;
     </p>
     <p>
      ì
      Phase 5 set forth in Addendum 13 to the Executive Order issued May 6, 2020, which expanded some outdoor recreation and allowed limited social interactions; and
     </p>
     <p>
      ì
      Phase 6 set forth in an Amendment to Addendum 6 to the Executive Order (Stay Home/Stay Safe) issued May 13, 2020, which allowed for limited resumption of retail operations which were not deemed critical under Stay Home/Stay Safe; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the Governor has determined, in consultation with the Commissioner of VDH and DPS/VEM, based on the best science and data available, to extend the State of Emergency for the State of Vermont through Monday, June 15, 2020; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the Governor has further determined, in consultation with the Commissioner of VDH and DPS/VEM, based on the best science and data available, to further modify Addendum 6 to the Executive Order to expand the range of activities and travel Vermonters may enjoy with an understanding that VDH and CDC health and safety measures should be followed; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the Governor has determined to authorize lodging facilities to resume operations on a limited basis beginning May 22, 2020, subject to further action as needed to respond to continued COVID-19 response.
     </p>
     <p>
      NOW THEREFORE, I, Philip B. Scott, by virtue of the authority vested in me as Governor of Vermont by the Constitution of the State of Vermont, the emergency powers set forth in <cite class="vt-code">20 V.S.A. §§ 8</cite>, 9 and 11 and other laws hereby declare the State of Emergency for the State of Vermont shall be extended through midnight on Monday, June 15, 2020.

     <p>
      <b>
       IT IS FURTHER ORDERED:
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      1.
    Except as set forth herein, the Executive Order and all Directives and Addenda, as amended, issued thereunder shall continue in full force and effect until midnight on June 15, 2020, at which time the Governor, in consultation with the Vermont Department of Health and the Department of Public Safety/Division of Emergency Management shall assess the emergency and determine whether to amend or extend the State of Emergency.
     </p>
     <p>
      2.
      <b>
       Be Smart/Stay Safe:
      </b>
      Section 1 of Addendum 6 of the Executive Order (Stay Home/Stay Safe), is hereby amended and restated as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      To preserve the public health and safety, to ensure the healthcare delivery system is capable of serving all, and to help protect those at the highest risk and vulnerability, Vermonters are encouraged to limit their exposure to disease outside their homes or places of residence as much as possible.
     </p>
     <p>
      Vermonters should travel only as needed:
     </p>
     <p>
      ì
      For personal safety, medical care and care of others;
     </p>
     <p>
      ì
      For work, although all workers should continue to work remotely whenever possible;
     </p>
     <p>
      ì
      For shopping and services available at all businesses and non-profit and government entities determined to be critical and those which have been authorized to resume operations;
     </p>
     <p>
      ì
      To get fresh air and exercise by taking advantage of outdoor recreation and outdoor fitness activities that require low or no direct physical contact;
     </p>
     <p>
      ì
      For limited social interactions and gatherings of 10 or fewer, preferably in outdoor settings; and
     </p>
     <p>
      ì
      For in-state stays at available lodging, campground and marina facilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      To keep disease from spreading, Vermonters should maintain physical distancing and protocols for hygiene recommended in guidance from CDC, VDH and other designated state agencies and departments. This means:
     </p>
     <p>
      ì
      Always staying home and away from others if you are sick with COVID-19, have recently been exposed to someone who has COVID-19, or just don't feel well;
     </p>
     <p>
      ì
      Keeping a 6-foot distance from others when you meet people outside of your household;
     </p>
     <p>
      ì
      Frequently washing your hands (hand sanitizer is acceptable when soap and water are not available);
     </p>
     <p>
      ì
      Coughing and sneezing into your elbow (even if you are wearing a facial covering);
     </p>
     <p>
      ì
      Wearing a facial covering over your nose and mouth when you are in close proximity to others from outside your household; and
     </p>
     <p>
      ì
      Limiting travel to within Vermont to the extent possible and when you do travel, limit non-essential stops.
     </p>
     <p>
      Older adults (age 65 and over), and people with underlying medical conditions, like heart and lung disease or diabetes, are more likely to develop severe illness. They should continue to shelter in place, and Vermonters should do everything they can to help keep them safe.
     </p>
     <p>
      3.
      <b>
       General Public Mask Use.
      </b>
      All Vermonters are encouraged to wear face coverings over their nose and mouth any time they are interacting with others from outside their households, including in congregate outdoor settings where it is not possible to maintain physical distancing. Masks are not recommended for strenuous outdoor activity, anyone under the age of 2, anyone with a medical condition that is complicated or irritated by a facial covering, or anyone with difficulty breathing. Masks are not required when eating in outdoor settings. Businesses and non-profit and government entities may require customers or clients to wear masks. The legislative body of each municipality may enact more strict local requirements regarding mask use than those set forth herein.
     </p>
     <p>
      4.
      <b>
       Lodging Operations.
      </b>
      Addendum 6 and Addendum 7 to the Executive Order are hereby modified to allow the limited resumption of lodging operations, including hotels, motels, bed and breakfasts, inns, short term rentals, such as those made available through VRBO, Homeaway, AirBnb and other services, parks for recreational vehicles and campgrounds, all public and private camping facilities including those managed by the Vermont Department of Parks and Recreation, and marinas.

     </p>
     <p>
      d.
    Lodging for Vermont residents and others who certify self-quarantine for a minimum of 14 days prior to lodging overnight in Vermont.
     </p>
     <p>

Lodging providers, and the online platforms that facilitate rentals and reservations, shall clearly post a prominent notice on their web platforms which advises potential guests of the health and safety requirements currently applicable to lodging and gatherings in Vermont.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Secretary of the Agency of Commerce and Community Development (ACCD) shall issue mitigation requirements and procedures which require implementation of appropriate occupancy limits for stays and events and physical distancing, health and sanitation and training measures.

     </p>
     <p>
      If the Commissioner of the VDH has determined that a COVID-19 outbreak has occurred and lodging operations cannot safely operate in a way that 1) limits the exposure of customers and staff to COVID-19 and 2) does not threaten to overwhelm our hospitals and healthcare resources, he is hereby authorized, with approval of the Governor, to notify and require any or all lodging operations to return to certain standards of operation.

      [Close Contact Businesses; Large Social Gatherings]
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, on March 7, 2020 and March 11, 2020, the Vermont Department of Health (VDH) detected the first two cases of COVID-19 in Vermont and almost two months later Vermont has experienced almost 1,000 cases and over 50 related deaths; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, on Friday, March 13, 2020, the Governor issued Executive Order 01-20, Declaration of State of Emergency in Response to COVID-19 and National Guard Call-Out ("Executive Order"), declaring a state of emergency for the State of Vermont in response to COVID-19; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the Executive Order expressly recognized the critical need to minimize the risk to the public, maintain the health and safety of Vermonters, and limit the spread of infection in our communities and within our healthcare facilities and imposed a limit on the size of mass gatherings; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, consistent with Centers for Disease Control (CDC) guidelines regarding social distancing, and in consultation with the Commissioner of the Department of Health (VDH), the Governor has directed a number of mitigation strategies for the State in order to protect individuals at risk for severe illness, including suspension of the operations of close contact businesses, additional limits on the size of gatherings and self-quarantine requirements for those travelling to Vermont to stay; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, modeling studies done for the State clearly show that, but for the mitigation measures taken to date, the number of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths in the State and the region would be having a much more devastating effect on Vermonters and would be threatening to overwhelm the capacity of the Vermont health care system; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the Governor has undertaken a cautious, incremental and evidence-based approach to restarting Vermont's economy and continues to do so with the limited reopening of close contact businesses and incremental increases to the size of gatherings.
     </p>
     <p>
      NOW THEREFORE, I, Philip B. Scott, by virtue of the authority vested in me as Governor of Vermont by the Constitution of the State of Vermont, the emergency powers set forth in <cite class="vt-code">20 V.S.A. §§ 8</cite>, 9 and 11 and other laws, hereby supplement Addendum 4 to the Executive Order to direct the Secretary of the Agency of Commerce and Community Development (ACCD) to issue mitigation requirements and procedures for the limited, incremental and phased resumption of close contact businesses such as gymnasiums, fitness centers and similar exercise facilities, nail salons, spas and tattoo parlors business, effective June 1, 2020. The limited, incremental, and phased resumption of close contact businesses shall require implementation of appropriate occupancy limits and physical distancing, health and sanitation and training measures.

      As of June 1, 2020, Section 6 of the Executive Order and Addendum 4 to the Executive Order are amended to allow social gatherings of up to twenty-five (25) people at the same time in any confined indoor or outdoor space which encourages congregation;
      <b>
       provided however,
      </b>
      to the extent the Secretary of ACCD has established occupancy limits for business and non-profit and government entity operations, including, but not limited to, retail, recreational, dining, worship and event spaces in order to ensure appropriate physical distancing, applicable occupancy limits shall apply. Absent an established occupancy limit, the limit on social gatherings as set forth herein and modified by the Secretary of ACCD, shall apply.

     </p>
     <p>
      If the Commissioner of the VDH has determined that a COVID-19 outbreak has occurred and close contact businesses cannot safely operate in a way that 1) limits the exposure of customers and staff to COVID-19; and 2) does not threaten to overwhelm our hospitals and healthcare resources, he is hereby authorized, with approval of the Governor, to notify and require any or all businesses and non-profit and government entities to return to certain standards of operation.
     </p>
     <p>
      Further, the Secretary of ACCD, in consultation with the Commissioner of VDH, and with the approval of the Governor, may, from time-to-time, authorize additional limited and incremental increases to gathering size.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the Commissioner of the VDH has determined that a COVID-19 outbreak has occurred and Vermonters cannot safely congregate in gatherings due to increased risk of exposure to COVID-19, he is hereby authorized, with approval of the Governor, to decrease the size of gatherings as necessary to minimize the risk to the public, maintain the health and safety of Vermonters, and limit the spread of infection in our communities and within our healthcare facilities.

     <p>
      WHEREAS, the Governor has undertaken a cautious, incremental and evidence-based approach to restarting Vermont's economy and continues to do so with the modification of the State's quarantine requirements to facilitate travel into Vermont without home-quarantine for a period of fourteen (14) days, based on data regarding rates of COVID-19 infection; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the impact of COVID-19 on the Northeast United States has been significant with approximately 41 percent of all confirmed U.S. cases located within a 5-hour drive of the Vermont border, however, analysis by the State has found many counties in New York and New England currently have a low active case count making the risk of COVID-19 transmission for those traveling from those counties to Vermont low.
     </p>
     <p>
      NOW THEREFORE, I, Philip B. Scott, by virtue of the authority vested in me as Governor of Vermont by the Constitution of the State of Vermont, the emergency powers set forth in <cite class="vt-code">20 V.S.A. §§ 8</cite>, 9 and 11 and other laws, hereby order the following:

      2.
    The Commissioner of the Department of Financial Regulation (DFR) shall report to the Governor on a weekly basis on the regional data regarding rates of COVID-19 infection, by county, for New York and each New England state. The list of qualifying counties shall be updated weekly and posted to the website of ACCD.
     </p>
     <p>
      3.
    The Secretary of ACCD, in consultation with the Commissioner of DFR and the Commissioner of VDH, with the approval of the Governor, may, from time-to-time, determine quarantine requirements designed with reference to state and regional COVID-19 infection rates to be the least restrictive means necessary to preserve the public health and safety, ensure the healthcare delivery system is capable of serving all, and help protect those at the highest risk and vulnerability.
     </p>
     <p>
      4.
    The Agency of Transportation and the Department of Motor Vehicles are hereby directed to post this guidance at all major points of entry into Vermont, on highway message boards and at the Burlington International Airport and all other Vermont airports.
     </p>
     <p>
      5.
    Guidance for self-quarantine shall be made available by ACCD and VDH.
     </p>
     <p>
      6.
    Vermonters planning to travel out of state should understand that each state may have its own quarantine policy unique to the needs of that jurisdiction to address the COVID-19 crisis.

     </p>
     <p>
      Further, for the sake of clarity, the Board of the Department of Liquor and Lottery (Board) is hereby directed to amend, rescind, or interpret its rules, procedures and permitting requirements as necessary, to allow first, third and fourth class licensees, licensed caterers and licensed manufacturers to resume operations in accordance with ACCD guidance for both outdoor and indoor restaurant and bar operations and catering events.

      WHEREAS, since December 2019, Vermont has been working in close collaboration with the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and with the United States Health and Human Services Agency to monitor and plan for the potential for an outbreak of respiratory illness due to a novel coronavirus (a disease now known as COVID-19), in the United States; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, this rapidly evolving global situation required the Governor to direct the Vermont Department of Health (VDH) to activate the Health Operations Center (HOC) in February 2020 when VDH began to monitor and later, test Vermonters who may have been exposed to COVID-19; and
     </p>
     <p>

     <p>
      WHEREAS, on March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, we learned that while most individuals affected by COVID-19 will experience mild flu-like symptoms, some individuals, especially those who are elderly or already have severe underlying chronic health conditions will have more serious symptoms and require hospitalization; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, on Friday, March 13, 2020, the Governor issued Executive Order 01-20, Declaration of State of Emergency in Response to COVID-19 and National Guard Call-Out ("Executive Order"), declaring a state of emergency for the State of Vermont in response to COVID-19 (extended April 10 and May 15, 2020); and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, at the federal level, three separate emergency declarations were declared and remain in effect: a Health and Human Services (HHS) Public Health Emergency (January 31, 2020 renewed April 21, 2020), a Stafford Act Emergency (March 13, 2020), and a National Emergency (March 13, 2020); and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, all states in the region, including Vermont, have experienced community transmission of COVID-19 which has led to hundreds of thousands of cases and thousands of deaths, with at least one-third of all cases nationally found within a five hour drive of Vermont's borders; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the Governor, in consultation with VDH, has initiated aggressive and sustained efforts to protect property and public health, and to ensure public safety in this health emergency including issuing an Executive Order, as supplemented and amended and Directives issued pursuant to the Executive Order to limit in-person contact, such as limiting the size of gatherings, closure of schools and the institution of remote learning through the end of the 2019-2020 school year, directing the postponement of non-essential medical and surgical procedures, suspending the operation of close contact businesses, requiring telecommuting and work from home, requiring Vermonters to stay home and stay safe with exceptions for essential purposes and suspending the operation of businesses which were not deemed critical to public health and safety and national and economic security; and

     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the Governor has undertaken a cautious, measured and data-based approach to restarting Vermont's economy to minimize the risk to the public by limiting the spread of infection in our communities in order to protect the most vulnerable, while reopening our business, non-profit, government and recreation sectors in a safe and effective way; and

       Stay Safe.
      </b>
      To preserve the public health and safety, to ensure the health care delivery system is capable of serving all, and to help protect those at the highest risk and vulnerability, Vermonters are encouraged to limit their exposure to disease outside their homes or places of residence as much as possible.
     </p>
     <p>
      a. Vermonters should travel only as needed:
     </p>
     <p>
      i. For personal safety, medical care and care of others;
     </p>
     <p>
      ii. For work, although all workers should continue to work remotely whenever possible;
     </p>
     <p>
      iii. For shopping and services available at all businesses and non-profit and government entities;
     </p>
     <p>
      iv. To get fresh air and exercise by taking advantage of outdoor recreation and outdoor fitness activities that require low or no direct physical contact;
     </p>
     <p>
      v. For limited social interactions and gatherings at or below the current gathering size limit set forth in ACCD and VDH guidance, preferably in outdoor settings; and
     </p>
     <p>
      vi. For in-state stays at available lodging, campground and marina facilities.
     </p>
     <p>
      b. To keep disease from spreading, Vermonters should maintain physical distancing and protocols for hygiene recommended in guidance from CDC, VDH and other designated state agencies and departments. This means:
     </p>
     <p>
      i. Except as needed for medical care, staying home and away from others if you are sick with COVID-19, have recently been exposed to someone who has COVID-19, or just don't feel well;
     </p>
     <p>
      ii. Keeping a six-foot distance from others when you meet people outside of your household;
     </p>
     <p>
      iii. Frequently washing your hands (hand sanitizer is acceptable when soap and water are not available);
     </p>
     <p>
      iv. Coughing and sneezing into your elbow or a tissue (even if you are wearing a facial covering);
     </p>
     <p>
      v. Wearing a facial covering over your nose and mouth when you are in close proximity to others from outside your household; and
     </p>
     <p>
      vi. Limiting travel to within Vermont to the extent possible and when you do travel, limit non-essential stops.
     </p>
     <p>
      c. Individuals Who May be at Higher Risk. Older adults (age 65 and older) and people of any age who have serious underlying medical conditions, for example, heart and lung disease or diabetes might be at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 and should call their health
    care professional with concerns about COVID-19
    and underlying health conditions or if they are sick.
     </p>
     <p>
      Additional guidance for individuals at higher risk can be found on the Vermont Department of Health website.
     </p>
     <p>
      d. All public and private enterprises shall post appropriate notices requiring compliance with recommendations by the CDC and the Commissioner of VDH including, at a minimum, those set forth above.
     </p>
     <p>
      e. Trusted Households. Members of one household may choose to socialize-and allow children to play - with members of another household, such as family, neighbors or friends known to be following VDH/CDC health and safety precautions. Vermonters should follow VDH guidance on recommended practices which allow connection with small groups of family and friends from "trusted households" in ways that allow them to relax some physical distancing.
     </p>
     <p>
      f. Mask Use. All Vermonters are encouraged to wear facial coverings over their nose and mouth any time they are interacting with others from outside their households, especially in congregate settings where it is not possible to maintain physical distancing. Masks are not recommended for strenuous outdoor activity, anyone under the age of 2, anyone with a medical condition that is complicated or irritated by a facial covering, or anyone with difficulty breathing. Businesses and non-profit and government entities may require customers or clients to wear masks.
     </p>
     <p>
      The legislative body of each municipality may enact more strict local requirements regarding mask use than those set forth herein.
     </p>
     <p>
      g. Mask Use on Public Transit Conveyances or in Mass Transportation Facilities. The traveling and commuting public shall wear face coverings over their nose and mouth any time they are using public transportation conveyances, including busses, trains, and ride services and when in a mass transportation station or terminal, including airports.
     </p>
     <p>
      h. Gathering Size. Social gatherings shall be limited to up to twenty-five (25) people at the same time in any confined indoor or outdoor space which encourages congregation;
      <b>
       provided, however,
      </b>
      to the extent the Secretary of the Agency of Commerce and Community Development (ACCD) has established occupancy limits for business and non-profit and government entity operations, including, but not limited to, retail, recreational, dining, worship and event spaces in order to ensure appropriate physical distancing, applicable occupancy limits shall apply. Absent an established occupancy limit, the limit on social gatherings as set forth herein and modified by the Secretary of ACCD from time to time, with the approval of the Governor, shall apply.
     </p>
     <p>
      i. Quarantine.
     </p>
     <p>
      i. Effective Monday, June 8, 2020, travel is permitted without quarantine restrictions to and from those counties of Maine, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut and New York as set forth in guidance issued by the Secretary of ACCD.
     </p>
     <p>
      ii. The Commissioner of the Department of Financial Regulation (DFR) shall report to the Governor on a weekly basis on the regional data regarding rates of COVID-19 infection, by county, for New York and each New England state, and as may otherwise be requested. The list of qualifying counties shall be updated weekly and posted to the website of ACCD.
     </p>
     <p>
      iii. Travelers, including Vermonters, who visit or are from a county other than the counties identified in ACCD guidance as non-quarantine counties must still quarantine upon arrival or return to Vermont.
     </p>
     <p>
      Effective June 15, 2020, visitors to Vermont may complete either: (i) a 14-day quarantine; or (ii) a 7-day quarantine followed by a negative test in their home state and enter Vermont without further quarantine restrictions if they drive directly from their home via their personal vehicle.
     </p>
     <p>
      Alternatively, visitors may complete either: (i) a 14-day quarantine; or (ii) a 7-day quarantine followed by a negative test - in a Vermont lodging establishment regardless of destination origin or manner of travel (travelers must stay in their quarantine location for the duration of quarantine other than to travel to and from a test site).
     </p>
     <p>
      iv. To preserve the public health and safety, to ensure the health care delivery system is capable of serving all, and to help protect those at the highest risk and vulnerability, any person, resident or non-resident, travelling into Vermont for anything other than daily commute for authorized work, health care, groceries, family visitation or recreation, must comply with guidance issued by the Secretary of ACCD.
     </p>
     <p>
      v. The Agency of Transportation and the Department of Motor Vehicles are hereby directed to post this guidance at all major points of entry into Vermont, on highway message boards and at the Burlington International Airport and all other Vermont airports.
     </p>
     <p>
      vi. Guidance for self-quarantine shall be published by ACCD and VDH on their public websites.
     </p>
     <p>
      vii. Vermonters planning to travel out-of-state should understand that each state may have its own quarantine policy unique to the needs of that jurisdiction to address the COVID-19 crisis. Vermonters are expected to be familiar with and respect the quarantine policies of these states when travelling.
     </p>
     <p>
      8.
      <b>
       Fairs and Festivals.
      </b>
      Vermonters planning fairs and festivals require certainty given the long lead time necessary for the successful operation of these fairs and festivals. For the sake of clarity, in light of the importance of maintaining the public health outcomes achieved to date, and continuing to make more progress in suppressing, containing and eliminating the spread of the virus, how people gather, and in what quantity, will continue to change in the months ahead. This will be problematic for large event planning purposes over the next 3-4 months, and therefore, traditional fairs and festivals are hereby cancelled until further notice.
     </p>
     <p>
      This shall not prevent fairgrounds and other indoor and outdoor venues from operating for sporting, entertainment, concerts and other events in accordance with then applicable VDH/ACCD guidance on gathering size, occupancy limits, distancing and other health and safety requirements.
     </p>

      <b>
       Work Safe.
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      a. Preventing outbreaks and limiting the spread of COVID-19 is the only way to avoid future business and social disruption. The success of Vermont's economic recovery will depend in large part on the ability of employers and employees to adhere to the public health, safety, and social distancing measures essential to limiting the spread of illness.
     </p>
     <p>
      b. For the health and safety of all Vermonters, all business, non-profit and government entity operations, including close contact businesses, gyms and fitness facilities, bars, restaurants and other food services and recreational resources such as lodging, campgrounds, marinas, playgrounds and team sports, shall only operate in accordance with the occupancy limits and physical distancing, health and sanitation and training requirements set forth in ACCD Work Safe Guidance.
     </p>
     <p>
      Businesses and non-profit and government entities which are not authorized to operate as of the date of this Amended and Restated Executive Order shall be addressed at a later date.
     </p>
     <p>
      Businesses and not-for-profit entities in the state that do not meet ACCD occupancy limits and physical distancing, health and sanitation and training requirements shall suspend in-person business operations.
     </p>
     <p>
      c. All businesses and not-for profit and government entities are encouraged to continue business strategies, procedures and practices to maximize use of online presence, telephone and web-based service delivery and phone or online orders for curb-side pick-up and delivery.
     </p>
     <p>
      d. For the sake of clarity, municipal services shall be made available to Vermonters seeking to perform authorized functions, such as recordings required for real estate, financial and other legal transactions, as well as services required so economically disadvantaged populations can access available benefits.
     </p>
     <p>
      e. Telework. All businesses and non-profit and government entities shall encourage and facilitate telework among those employees with the capacity to work remotely when practical without impeding productivity. Employers shall accommodate the needs of high risk individuals, those workers who may have child care needs which cannot be met due to the closure of schools or child care facilities for reasons relating to COVID-19 and those individuals with concerns about personal health circumstances.
     </p>
     <p>
      f. Education and Compliance. The Vermont Occupational Safety and Health Administration, Health inspectors, AAFM inspectors, and Department of Liquor and Lottery enforcement officers shall, in the ordinary course of the performance of their duties, ensure businesses and non-profit and governmental entities have the information necessary to comply with the health and safety requirements set forth in ACCD Work Safe Guidance.
     </p>
     <p>
      g. Economic Recovery. ACCD shall work with the Vermont business and non-profit community, the General Assembly, the U.S. Small Business Administration (SBA) and other federal funders and the Vermont Small Business Development Center (SBDC) to ensure Vermont businesses have the resources needed to address the economic impact of losses for the period of the declaration of emergency as compared to the same period of the preceding year for the purpose of obtaining available loan, grant and other assistance.

Enforcement of all municipal ordinances and regulations requiring an applicant to receive an approval or permit for outdoor food and beverage service is hereby suspended until such time as the local jurisdiction has acted to disapprove an Outdoor Consumption Permit issued by DLL. All applications may be subject to review and approval by the local jurisdiction and reasonable conditions may be imposed, provided that nothing in this Order shall require a municipality to approve an Outdoor Consumption Permit.

     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, despite months of success, statewide there is an acceleration in COVID-19 transmission; from November 8, 2020 to November 12, 2020, the number of new cases reported statewide increased at a rate as high as 50% per day (from 23 to 47 to 72 and to 109 cases); and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, in accordance with the Executive Order, as amended and restated, the Commissioner of VDH has determined that COVID-19 outbreaks have occurred, attributing this surge to a number of factors, primarily increased informal social gatherings involving alcohol, both indoors and outdoors, among people of different households, thus increasing the exposure of Vermonters and visitors to COVID-19, spreading the disease into more homes and workplaces and threatening to overwhelm our hospitals and health care resources; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the Commissioner has advised the Governor on the appropriate return to more limited standards of operation and social gatherings in order to control outbreaks of COVID-19, particularly among those who are elderly or already have underlying chronic health conditions, minimize the risk to the public, maintain the health and safety of Vermonters and limit the spread of infection in our communities and within our healthcare facilities; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, without a return to more limited standards of operation and social gatherings, as well as a requirement for greater cooperation by Vermonters with VDH contact tracing efforts, COVID-19 would likely continue to spread in Vermont at a rate similar to the rate of spread in other states and countries, and the number of persons requiring medical care could exceed available resources; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the Governor has determined, in consultation with the Commissioner of VDH, that with Vermont's aggressive advances in the areas of contact tracing, surveillance testing and diagnostic and surveillance testing, it is possible to limit standards of operation and social gatherings, while keeping Vermonters working and our children in school; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, Vermonters must come together as we have before in this crisis, to do our part to protect the very ill and elderly, ensure those who experience the most severe symptoms have access to the care they need, and keep our schools and economy open, by preventing and slowing the spread of this virus; and
     </p>

     <p>
      [Extension of State of Emergency Declared March 13, 2020
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, since December 2019, Vermont has been working in close collaboration with the National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ("CDC") and with the United States Health and Human Services Agency to first monitor and plan for outbreaks of a respiratory illness due to a novel coronavirus ("COVID-19") and then to implement measures to keep Vermonters healthy and safe; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the United States Secretary of Health and Human Services (HHS) declared a public health emergency on January 31, 2020, which was renewed effective January 21, 2021 for 90 days and, as advised in a letter to the Governor dated January 22, 2021 from the Acting Secretary of HHS, will likely remain in place for the entirety of 2021; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the Governor directed the Vermont Department of Health ("VDH") to activate the Health Operations Center in February 2020 when VDH began to monitor and later, test Vermonters who may have been exposed to COVID-19; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, in March 2020, the Governor directed the Department of Public Safety, Division of Vermont Emergency Management ("DPS") to assemble an interagency taskforce, and later to activate the Vermont State Emergency Operations Center ("SEOC"), in accordance with the State Emergency Management Plan, to organize prevention, response, mitigation and, most recently, vaccination efforts and share information with local and State officials; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, on March 7, 2020 and March 11, 2020, VDH detected the first two cases of COVID-19 in Vermont and as of March 14, 2021, the State has experienced 16,890 cases, and tragically surpassed 200 deaths which are COVID-19 related; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, on March 11, 2020 the World Health Organization made the assessment that COVID-19 can be characterized as a pandemic; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, on Friday, March 13, 2020, the Governor issued Executive Order 01-20, Declaration of State of Emergency in Response to COVID-19 and National Guard Call-Out ("Executive Order"), declaring a state of emergency for the State of Vermont in response to COVID-19; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, on February 24, 2021, President Biden provided notice to the United States Congress that the national emergency declaration for the COVID-19 pandemic, originally issued by former President Trump on March 13, 2020, will continue in effect beyond March 1, 2021; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, following the issuance of the Executive Order, the Governor, in consultation with VDH, DPS and the Vermont Agency of Human Services, initiated aggressive and sustained efforts to protect property and public health, and to ensure public safety in the COVID-19 health emergency including issuing the Executive Order, as supplemented and amended and Directives issued pursuant to the Executive Order, to limit in-person contact, such as limiting the size of gatherings, closure of schools and the institution of remote learning through the end of the 2019-2020 school year, directing the postponement of non-essential medical and surgical procedures, suspending the operation of close contact businesses, requiring telecommuting and work from home, requiring Vermonters to stay home and stay safe, with exceptions for essential purposes, and suspending the operation of businesses which were not deemed critical to public health and safety and national and economic security; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, modeling studies done for the State clearly show that, but for the mitigation measures taken at that time, the number of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths in the State would have had a much more devastating effect on Vermonters and threatened to overwhelm the capacity of the Vermont health care system; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, beginning in April 2020, the Governor undertook a cautious, measured and data-based approach to restarting Vermont's economy to minimize the risk to the public by limiting the spread of infection in our communities in order to protect the most vulnerable, while reopening our business, non-profit, government and recreation sectors in a safe and effective way; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the mitigation measures taken in 2020, including mandatory mask-wearing among other mandatory health and safety protocols, substantial federal financial aid, food distribution and emergency housing, prepared Vermonters, our healthcare institutions and our schools for the spike in COVID-19 cases in late fall and early winter to such an extent Vermont was able to avoid a substantial roll-back of Vermont's economic restart efforts; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the COVID-19 vaccine in Vermont is bringing much needed relief and, together with federal efforts, the Governor is proceeding to roll out vaccine delivery in a methodical, deliberate process designed to protect the Vermonters most vulnerable to severe illness or death from COVID, as well as return our children to school full-time as quickly as possible; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, numerous tools needed to address response efforts remain in place by virtue of the State of Emergency declaration, including robust vaccine implementation, protections for residents of long term and other medical care facilities, National Guard resources standing by to assist with the COVID-19 response, workplace health and safety requirements, public gathering limitations, a mandate for facial coverings, expanded housing and meal delivery systems and associated federal emergency funding, expanded eligibility for unemployment insurance, tools needed by certain businesses to maintain a minimum level of economic sustainability and enhanced protections to prevent evictions and utility service disconnection; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the Governor has determined, in consultation with the Commissioner of VDH and DPS, based on the best science and data available, to extend the State of Emergency for the State of Vermont through Saturday, May 15, 2021.
     </p>
     <p>
      NOW THEREFORE, I, Philip B. Scott, by virtue of the authority vested in me as Governor of Vermont by the Constitution of the State of Vermont, the emergency powers set forth in <cite class="vt-code">20 V.S.A. §§ 8</cite>, 9 and 11 and other laws, hereby declare the State of Emergency for the State of Vermont shall be extended through midnight on Saturday, May 15, 2021.

     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, on Friday, March 13, 2020, the Governor issued Executive Order 01-20, Declaration of State of Emergency ("Executive Order"), as amended and restated June 15, 2020 ("Amended and Restated Executive Order"), declaring a state of emergency for the State of Vermont in response to COVID-19; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, all states in the region, including Vermont, have experienced community transmission of COVID-19 which has led to hundreds of thousands of cases and thousands of deaths within a five hour drive of Vermont's borders; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the Governor, in consultation with the Vermont Department of Health (VDH), has initiated aggressive and sustained efforts to protect property and public health, and to ensure public safety in this health emergency including issuing the Executive Order, as amended and restated, and Directives issued pursuant to the Executive Order to limit in-person contact, such as limiting the size of gatherings, closure of schools and the institution of remote learning through the end of the 2019-2020 school year, directing the postponement of non-essential medical and surgical procedures, suspending the operation of close contact businesses, requiring telecommuting and work from home, requiring Vermonters to stay home and stay safe with exceptions for essential purposes and suspending the operation of businesses which were not deemed critical to public health and safety and national and economic security; and

     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, in connection with the Governor's cautious, measured and data-based approach to restarting Vermont's economy in a safe and effective way, on April 20, 2020, the Governor issued Addendum 10 to the Executive Order that established health and safety requirements to be followed by all employers and employees, including mandatory facial coverings for employees when in the presence of others, and strongly encouraged all Vermonters to wear facial coverings when in the presence of others; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, on May 1, 2020 the Governor issued Addendum 12 to the Executive Order that required facial coverings on public transit conveyances, including ride services, and in mass transportation facilities; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, on June 15, 2020, the Governor issued an Amended and Restated Executive Order which reiterated existing mask policies and recommended Vermonters use facial coverings when in contact with individuals from outside their household, and especially when maintaining a physical distance of six feet was not possible; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, on July 24, 2020, in anticipation of colder weather, more frequent indoor gatherings and the coming flu season, the Governor issued Addendum 2 to the Amended and Restated Executive Order directing all Vermonters to wear masks or cloth facial coverings over their nose and mouth in most instances when they are in public spaces, and in contact with others from outside their households; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, modeling studies done for the State clearly show that, but for the mitigation measures taken by the Governor, the number of COVID-19 hospitalizations and COVID-19 related deaths in the State would have had a much more devastating effect on Vermonters and threatened to overwhelm the capacity of the Vermont health care system; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the mitigation measures taken in 2020, including significant testing and contact tracing capacity, mask-wearing and other health and safety protocols, substantial federal financial aid, food distribution and emergency housing, prepared Vermonters, healthcare institutions and schools for the spike in COVID-19 cases in late fall and early winter to such an extent Vermont was able to avoid a substantial roll-back of Vermont's ongoing restart efforts; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, thanks to the initiation of Vermont's nation-leading vaccination program and continued adherence by Vermonters to the State's safety measures and substantial uptake of vaccine, Vermont is now seeing significant decreases in its rate of hospitalizations and deaths; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, this trend has allowed the Agency of Commerce and Community Development (ACCD), in consultation with VDH, with the approval of the Governor, to release the Vermont Forward Roadmap to Reopening: Phased Reopening Plan ("Vermont Forward"), to relieve restrictions on the operations of businesses and non-profit and government entities as certain vaccination goals are met; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the CDC has recently acknowledged, and the science and data strongly indicate that, transmission of COVID-19 in outdoor settings is very rare, the Governor, in consultation with VDH, the Department of Financial Regulation and the Department of Public Safety, has determined that the data and conditions in Vermont support further reducing restrictions on all Vermonters when outside.
     </p>
     <p>
      NOW THEREFORE, I, Philip B. Scott, by virtue of the authority vested in me as Governor of Vermont by the Constitution of the State of Vermont, Chapter II, Section 20 and under <cite class="vt-code">20 V.S.A. §§ 8</cite>, 9 and 11, hereby order the amendment of the Amended and Restated Executive Order as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      1.
      <b>
       Rescission of Addendum.

     </p>
     <p>
      (f)
    Masks or Cloth Facial Coverings.
     </p>
     <p>
      As of Friday, April 30, 2021, Vermonters are no longer required to wear face coverings over nose and mouth when they are in outdoor public spaces, provided sustained or prolonged close contact with individuals from outside their household can be avoided.
     </p>
     <p>
      For clarity, "sustained or prolonged contact" is defined as more than several minutes. "Close contact" is defined as being less than six-feet from an individual from outside your household. For example, masking would not be required when passing someone on the sidewalk or at an outdoor market. Put another way, when you are outdoors, masks are only required when you are in a crowd or with multiple other households where you cannot avoid close contact.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Commissioner of VDH, with the approval of the Governor, is hereby delegated the authority to implement and update guidance regarding the use of masks or cloth facial coverings required indoors or outdoors in public.
     </p>
     <p>
      Nothing in this Order or any other State health and safety guidance shall require the use of a mask or cloth facial covering when someone is engaged in strenuous exercise or activity, for anyone under the age of 2, any child or adult with a medical or developmental issue or challenge that is complicated or irritated by a facial covering, anyone with difficulty breathing or as further set forth in guidance issued by VDH. A person who declines to wear a mask or cloth face covering because of a medical or developmental issue, or difficulty breathing, shall not be required to produce documentation, or other evidence, verifying the condition.
     </p>
     <p>
      Businesses and non-profit and government entities shall continue to implement measures notifying customers or clients of the requirement to wear masks or facial coverings in public indoor spaces. This notice may include, but shall not be limited to, posting signage stating that masks or cloth facial coverings are required and denial of entry or service to customers or clients who decline to wear masks or facial coverings.
     </p>
     <p>
      For the sake of clarity, the requirements for masks or facial coverings or permitted alternatives in specific circumstances shall continue to apply as set forth in the following guidance:
     </p>
     <p>
      ì
      Vermont Forward, permitting limited alternatives to face masks in limited workplace settings, as well as some flexibility on use of masks or facial coverings in other circumstances, such as when eating in a restaurant;
     </p>
     <p>
      ì
      A Strong and Healthy Year: Safety and Health Guidance for Vermont Schools, Spring 2021 issued by the Secretary of the Agency of Education (AoE);

     </p>
     <p>
      ì
      Other as set by a designated Secretary or Commissioner, with the approval of the Governor.
     </p>
     <p>
      The legislative body of each municipality may enact more strict local requirements regarding mask use than those set forth herein. Businesses may also enact more strict requirements regarding mask use than those set forth herein.
     </p>
     <p>
      To support further relaxation of restrictions, and a return to normal operations and full mobility, municipalities and businesses should encourage all residents, employees and customers to be vaccinated at the earliest opportunity.
     </p>
     <p>
      3.
      <b>
       Temporary Limitations on Business Operations and Social Gatherings.
      </b>
      Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Vermont Forward plan, restaurants, catering, food service, social clubs and bars must cease service at 10:00 pm each night, until the Secretary of ACCD, in consultation with the Commissioner of VDH, and with the approval of the Governor, lifts this restriction.
     </p>
     <p>
      4.
      <b>
       Unemployment Insurance; Work Search.
      </b>
      Effective May 9, 2021, Section 5(a) of the Amended and Restated Executive Order is hereby modified to direct the Commissioner of the Department of Labor to reinstitute the work search requirement for all workers seeking unemployment benefits.
     </p>
     <p>
      This Addendum 15 to the Amended and Restated Executive Order shall take effect upon signing and shall continue in full force and effect until midnight on May 15, 2021, at which time the Governor, in consultation with the Vermont Department of Health and the Department of Public Safety shall assess the emergency and determine whether to amend or extend this Addendum.

     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, on Friday, March 13, 2020, the Governor issued an Executive Order declaring a state of emergency for the State of Vermont in response to COVID-19; and

      1.
    Except as set forth below, all state regulated child care programs shall be closed no later than Wednesday, March 18, 2020 through April 6, 2020 ("Closure Period").
     </p>
     <p>

    I hereby amend my Directive to the Education Secretary of March 15, 2020 as set forth below regarding provision of care for students who are children of Essential Persons, as defined below.
     </p>
     <p>
      3.
      <b>
       Provision of services for children of Essential Persons:
      </b>
      With respect to provision of services for children of Essential Persons, this Directive provides emergency operating guidelines and applies to all schools under the authority of the Education Secretary for pre-K through grade 8 and all state-licensed child care programs. I encourage other private child care programs, private schools and independent schools to do their utmost to fulfill the spirit and guidance of this Directive.
     </p>
     <p>
      4.
    Essential Persons are those absolutely critical to the State's response to COVID-19 and continued public health and safety. Specifically, "Essential Persons" are defined as staff and providers of child care and education services (including custodial and kitchen staff and other support staff) for children of other Essential Persons, including custodial and kitchen staff; providers of healthcare including but not limited to workers at clinics, hospitals, Federally Qualified Health Centers (FQHCs); nursing homes, long-term care and post-acute care facilities, respite houses, VNAs; designated agencies, emergency medical services; criminal justice personnel including those in law enforcement, courts, and correctional services; public health employees; firefighters; Vermont National Guard personnel called to duty for this response; other first responders; and state employees determined to be essential for response to this crisis by the State Emergency Operations Center.
     </p>
     <p>
      5.
    Every child care program, school and school district has different circumstances and needs. However, the State will do everything possible to provide overarching guidance through Vermont Department of Health ("VDH"), Vermont Agency of Education ("VAOE"), Vermont Department of Children and Families, Child Development Division ("DCF" and "CDD") on approaches to operating during the Closure Period for services to children of Essential Persons, including hygiene and social distancing within schools and facilities as directed by VDH.
     </p>
     <p>
      6.
    With respect to schools under the authority of the Education Secretary, the Education Secretary shall ensure that:
     </p>
     <p>
      a. School employees are to report to work in accordance with applicable labor agreements and as required by their employers to assist with providing services to children of Essential Persons and Continuity of Education Planning as previously directed.
     </p>
     <p>
      b. During the Closure Period, schools are directed to provide care to, at a minimum, students through grade 8 who are children of Essential Persons. In providing this care, schools must practice hygiene and social distancing best practices as set forth by VDH guidance.
     </p>
     <p>
      c. Districts plan for and provide as resources allow extended care - before and after normal school hours and days - to students who are children of Essential Persons, recognizing that COVID-19 response may require extended working hours by our Essential Persons.
     </p>
     <p>
      d. Schools providing pre-K services under Act 166 continue to receive funding allocated to them during the Closure Period and all schools shall continue to receive State Education Fund allocations for enrolled students, regardless of actual daily attendance, throughout the Closure Period.
     </p>
     <p>
      e. Schools and school districts, in cooperation with state agencies, work to support families most impacted by this crisis, including, but not limited to, low-income families. During the Closure Period, school districts are expected to work with their schools and communities to continue to provide meals to their students, utilizing the Education Secretary's authority to assist with necessary waivers and to provide additional guidance on meal continuity.
     </p>
     <p>
      f. Planning occurs to provide additional funding as may be needed to schools to ensure continuity of services to children of Essential Persons during the Closure Period.
     </p>
     <p>
      g. Districts are encouraged to utilize facilities to minimize the total number of children and staff in any one facility.
     </p>
     <p>
      7.
    With respect to child care programs, the Secretary of the Agency of Human Services ("Human Services Secretary") shall oversee the implementation of this Directive and I hereby delegate to the Human Services Secretary such authority as may be necessary for this implementation in accordance with the below:
     </p>
     <p>
      a. During the Closure Period, state-licensed child care programs are asked to provide care to, at a minimum, their own enrollees who are children of Essential Persons. In providing this care, child care centers must practice hygiene and social distancing best practices as set forth by VDH.
     </p>
     <p>
      b. State-licensed child care centers are encouraged to also provide extended care - before and after normal operating hours - to enrollees who are children of Essential Persons and to work with CDD to provide care for those not presently enrollees in their facilities who are children of Essential Persons.
     </p>
     <p>
      c. Our licensing office of CDD will work with licensed child care centers to use best judgment to waive to the fullest extent possible all relevant licensing rules in order to permit child care centers to serve children of Essential Persons during the Closure Period.
     </p>
     <p>
      d. During the Closure Period, the State shall continue to provide current levels of tuition payments on behalf of eligible families to: (a) all child care programs serving CCFAP-eligible children; and (b) child care programs and schools providing services under Act 166 for pre-K students.
     </p>
     <p>
      e. CDD shall have authority, using its best judgment, to waive to the fullest extent possible all relevant licensing rules and regulations, including penalties, in order to permit licensed child care programs to serve children of Essential Persons during the Closure Period.
     </p>
     <p>
      f. The Human Services Secretary shall develop options for additional per-child-served funding to all child care centers that serve children of Essential Persons during the Closure Period.
     </p>
     <p>
      8.
    To support child care centers in staying open, supporting their employees, and remaining in business during this emergency and afterward, all State Agencies shall collaborate and align resources as directed by the Human Services Secretary, in consultation with the Governor, to support child care providers in accordance with this Directive.
     </p>
     <p>
      9.
    State Agencies shall collaborate on continuity of mental health services to children and their families during the Closure Period, as directed by the Human Services Secretary, in consultation with the Governor.
     </p>
     <p>
      10.
    All child care providers, school administrators, teachers and staff shall follow guidance issued by the Department of Health to ensure a healthy workplace during the Closure Period.
     </p>
     <p>
      11.
    Pursuant to the powers granted to the Governor in <cite class="vt-code">20 V.S.A. §§ 8</cite>, 9 and 11 and other provisions of law, I shall from time to time issue recommendations, directives and orders as circumstances may require.

     <p>
      AMENDMENT TO GOVERNOR'S DIRECTIVE 3 TO THE DEPARTMENT OF MOTOR VEHICLES
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, on March 7, 2020 and March 11, 2020, the Vermont Department of Health (VDH) detected the first two cases of COVID-19 in Vermont and almost two months later Vermont has experienced almost 1,000 cases and over 50 related deaths; and

      WHEREAS, on Friday, March 13, 2020, the Governor issued Executive Order 01-20, Declaration of State of Emergency in Response to COVID-19 and National Guard Call-Out ("Executive Order"), declaring a state of emergency for the State of Vermont in response to COVID-19; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the Executive Order expressly recognized the critical need to minimize the risk to the public, maintain the health and safety of Vermonters, and limit the spread of infection in our communities and within our healthcare facilities and directed the Commissioner of the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) to develop a plan to extend DMV licensing and registration renewal deadlines and other statutory and regulatory DMV requirements to mitigate contagion risk by reducing customer traffic throughout all DMV district offices; and

     <p>
      WHEREAS, modeling studies done for the State clearly show that, but for the mitigation measures taken to date, the number of COVID-19 cases and COVID-19 related deaths in the State and the region would be having a much more devastating effect on Vermonters and would be threatening to overwhelm the capacity of the Vermont health care system; and

      WHEREAS, just two months ago, this country watched the tragic death of George Floyd, and while Vermont has been committed to fair and impartial policing for some time, we must acknowledge work remains to be done; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, Vermont's Constitution requires every officer of the State in authority, whether judicial or executive or military, to swear an oath that, in the execution of their office, they will do equal right and justice to all persons, to the best of their ability, according to law; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, this oath imposes upon all state officers, including our state-wide elected officials, our judges, our prosecutors and our law enforcement officers an awesome responsibility and we must do all we can to ensure our officers and our institutions are prepared, in fact, to do equal right and justice to all persons; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, in January of this year, the Department of Public Safety (DPS) put forth an outline for modernizing policing and public safety in Vermont, which is based, in part, on more than 50 years of studies, reports and legislative drafts; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, in June of this year, together with law enforcement and community leaders, DPS drafted a comprehensive 10-point strategy to accelerate progress in the organization of state law enforcement operations, modernizing our data collection and reporting technology; expanding alternative crisis response methodologies such as field mental health workers; providing enhanced statewide model policies in key areas, including use of force; modernizing hiring practices, training and supervisor selection; and developing community oversight models; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, nationally, community representatives, law enforcement representatives and other advocacy groups are debating the risks and benefits of these and other measures such as an end to qualified immunity for law enforcement officers, removal of police from schools, banning the use of certain military equipment and techniques and banning certain surveillance techniques, all of which merit open and informed debate and consideration in Vermont's communities and in the Legislature; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the scope of this Order is to use the current lawful authority of the Governor and the resources available to the Executive Branch to accelerate the modernization of public safety operations throughout Vermont.
     </p>
     <p>
      NOW, THEREFORE, I, Philip B. Scott, by virtue of the authority vested in me as the Governor, do hereby order and direct as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       I. Short Term Priorities.
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      A.
      <b>
       Community Participation.
      </b>
      The Commissioner of DPS shall, in consultation with the Executive Director of Racial Equity, actively engage with communities, particularly those communities that have been historically marginalized or harmed by policing, as we develop and deploy best policing practices. Only through extensive outreach and participation can we achieve the goals outlined in the DPS's 10-point strategy, move forward on these initiatives and develop equitable processes that ensure equitable outcomes.
     </p>
     <p>
      B.
      <b>
       Hiring and Promotion Practices.
      </b>
      State and local law enforcement agencies must recruit, hire, retain and promote officers who reflect the values and diversity of the communities they serve. In furtherance of DPS's ongoing work in this area, on or before October 1, 2020, the Commissioner of DPS shall work with community representatives and other interested parties to develop model processes and begin to implement enhancements to systems for hiring interviews in selection processes, background investigations and polygraph and psychological examinations, for purposes of hiring and promotion, including the hiring of police executives in Vermont. The Vermont Criminal Justice Training Council (CJTC) shall consider the model processes developed by DPS for adoption by all law enforcement agencies statewide.
     </p>
     <p>
      On or before December 1, 2020, the Commissioner shall, in consultation with the Commissioner of Human Resources and the Executive Director of Racial Equity, develop additional initiatives to reach out to a more diverse hiring pool. This shall include measurable assessments of those efforts and outcomes.
     </p>
     <p>
      C.
      <b>
       Data.
      </b>
      DPS, in consultation with the Agency of Digital Services (ADS), shall prioritize the adoption of an updated statewide computer aided dispatch and records management data system that is standardized and mandatory for all agencies related to use of force, traffic stops, arrests, mental health and other related topics. Further, that system shall make data more swiftly and fully available to communities, Vermonters and researchers using a variety of modern tools ranging from easily accessible dashboards to raw data - excluding personally identifying information on any person. The Commissioner of DPS and the Secretary of ADS shall provide a weekly status update to the Governor on the progress toward statewide implementation of this system.
     </p>
     <p>
      D.
      <b>
       Body Worn Cameras.
      </b>
      As we look forward to a time when all law enforcement agencies in the State will be using body worn cameras, the State will require clear, consistent statewide policies governing their use, including universal policy on activation / de-activation, privacy issues, and release of camera footage.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Commissioner of DPS is hereby directed to expedite work to 1) identify the scope of need for cameras by all Vermont law enforcement agencies; and 2) in collaboration with Vermont community representatives, and in consultation with the Executive Director of Racial Equity and other stakeholders, develop for the consideration of the CJTC, a statewide model policy on body worn cameras for all law enforcement agencies and officers for use statewide.
     </p>
     <p>
      E.
      <b>
       Use of Force Policy.
      </b>
      On or before October 1, 2020, the Commissioner of DPS, in consultation with the Executive Director of Racial Equity, community representatives and other interested parties shall develop, for the consideration of the CJTC, a statewide model policy on the use of force for all law enforcement agencies and officers. The model policy shall establish a statewide definition for what constitutes a use of force by police, and include best practices on when use of force shall be prohibited, such as in response to peaceful protests, and under what circumstances proportional use of force may be necessary. The model policy shall also address when and under what circumstances police military equipment shall be prohibited and when and under what circumstances it may be necessary.
     </p>
     <p>
      At this time Vermont's State Police and local police agencies do not possess or use invasive surveillance technologies, advanced autonomous weaponry, facial recognition software or predictive policing technologies. It shall be the policy of the State that these technologies and techniques shall not be adopted by any law enforcement agency without express authorization under State law.
     </p>
     <p>
      Further, it shall be the policy of the State that a police agency's failure to adopt the statewide model use of force policy shall result in limitations on state funding and access to training for the agency.
     </p>
     <p>
      F.
      <b>
       Training.
      </b>
      The Commissioner has proposed a detailed plan for comprehensive law enforcement training modernization. I hereby direct the Commissioners of DPS, Corrections, Motor Vehicles and Fish and Wildlife, as a members of the CJTC, together with the new Executive Director of the Council, to coordinate and lead the efforts of the Council to develop and use updated, statewide training, schedules and methods. On or before December 1, 2020, the Commissioner of DPS shall report to the Governor on the status of these efforts.
     </p>
     <p>
      G.
      <b>
       Improper Conduct Allegations.
      </b>
      The process of investigating improper conduct allegations must be easily accessible and as transparent as possible, while protecting the privacy of both the accused and the complainant. Investigations must have swift and consistent outcomes and include community oversight.
     </p>
     <p>
      Working with community representatives and other interested parties to develop the most suitable models, on or before October 1, 2020, the Commissioner of DPS, in consultation with the Executive Director of Racial Equity and the CJTC, shall recommend to the Governor a statewide model policy for investigating allegations of improper conduct. This process should consider different models used outside of Vermont, including those involving civilian investigators or investigators from other agencies.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       II. Development of Legislative Proposals for 2021.
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      A.
      <b>
       Universal Reporting Portal for Improper Conduct Allegations.
      </b>
      On or before October 1, 2020, working with community representatives and other interested parties, the Commissioner of DPS shall develop, for the Governor's consideration, a legislative framework for uniform, statewide release of data and information regarding misconduct allegations. This shall include a proposal for development and implementation of a centralized statewide reporting portal and universal phone number for reporting allegations of misconduct.
     </p>
     <p>
      B.
      <b>
       Use of Force Investigation and Review.
      </b>
      On or before October 1, 2020, working with community representatives and other interested parties, the Commissioner of DPS shall propose, for consideration by the Governor, a statutory mandate that all lethal force used by law enforcement and all deaths in custody are investigated by the Vermont State Police Major Crime Unit and reviewed independently by the Office of the Attorney General and a State's Attorney in a manner that is free from both actual and apparent conflicts of interest.
     </p>
     <p>
      C.
      <b>
       Community Oversight Models.
      </b>
      On or before December 1, 2020, the Commissioner of DPS, in consultation with the Office of Attorney General's Division of Human Rights, and community representatives, shall recommend to the Governor one or more models of civilian oversight of law enforcement and develop a statutory framework for the consideration of the Governor. Any such statutory framework shall include provisions designed to create civilian oversight boards which minimize the risk of conflicts of interest, and the appearance of conflicts of interest between those serving on local civilian oversight boards and law enforcement executives or officers of a given locality. Once such example would be civilian oversight of law enforcement on a county-wide basis structured in a manner that avoids both actual and apparent conflicts of interest.
     </p>

      This Executive Order shall take effect upon execution.

       <br />
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Pub.L. No. 111-5, (hereinafter "ARRA") amended the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (hereinafter the "Code") to authorize state and local governments to issue Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds and Recovery Zone Facility Bonds (hereinafter together referred to as "Recovery Zone Bonds"); and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the Code established bond volume limitations, or caps, on the issuance of Recovery Zone Bonds and allocated those volume caps among the states to counties and large municipalities within each State based upon population and relative declines in employment in 2008; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the U.S. Treasury and Internal Revenue Service allocated Vermont's share of the Recovery Zone Bond volume caps to the State and sub-allocated the caps among 11 Vermont counties; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the Assistant Judges in 9 of those 11 counties, pursuant to their authority, have waived their counties' respective allocations and re-allocated their share of volume caps to the State of Vermont; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, on October 14, 2009, the State of Vermont Emergency Board, pursuant to its authority to allocate private activity volume cap among bond issuing instrumentalities of the State, will consider allocating all Recovery Zone Facility Bonds' volume cap waived by the counties to the Vermont Economic Development Authority, an instrumentality of the State of Vermont; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, in October, 2009, the Joint Fiscal Committee of the Vermont General Assembly, pursuant to its authority, will consider approving the Governor's allocation of the Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds' volume cap waived by the counties to the Vermont Municipal Bond Bank, an instrumentality of the State of Vermont, and to the State of Vermont should there be capacity not used by the Vermont Municipal Bond Bank; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the purpose of Recovery Zone Economic Development Bonds is to promote economic activity through expenditures that promote development or other economic activity in a recovery zone designated as such by the county or State, as applicable, that is the recipient of volume cap; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the purpose of the Recovery Zone Facility Bonds is to finance property used in the active conduct of a trade or business in a recovery zone; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, Recovery Zone Bonds are a significant resource to the State of Vermont and will stimulate economic activity, increase employment opportunities and mitigate the effects of the national recession; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the Code requires that all Recovery Zone Bonds be issued prior to January 1, 2011 and it is imperative that recovery zones in Vermont be designated as soon as possible to ensure that Vermont and Vermonters realize the full benefit of the bonds; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, the Code defines a recovery zone, among other things, as an area designated by the issuer as having significant poverty, unemployment, rate of home foreclosures, or general distress; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, unemployment in Vermont has nearly doubled statewide during the current downturn and every county of the state has suffered at least a doubling of unemployment since 2007 leading to significant general distress; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, 28% of Vermonters work outside their county of residence and new jobs created anywhere in the state will significantly benefit those impacted by the recession; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, projected state general fund revenues for FY2010 are 15% below actual revenues in FY2008 and are, in fact, less than actual FY2005 revenues and this severe impact on state revenues will be mitigated by development and construction anywhere in the state; and
     </p>
     <p>
      WHEREAS, there is no area of Vermont that has not been significantly impacted by the recession and it is urgent to address both the problems of unemployment and declining revenues in Vermont.
     </p>
     <p>
      NOW, THEREFORE, I, James H. Douglas, by virtue of the authority vested in me as Governor, do hereby designate the entire State of Vermont as a recovery zone under the Code as amended by ARRA.
    This designated recovery zone shall pertain to any Recovery Zone Bonds issued by the State of Vermont, the Vermont Economic Development Authority, the Vermont Municipal Bond Bank, and any other instrumentality of the State that may later receive an allocation of Recovery Zone Bond volume caps from the State.
     </p>
     <p>
      This Executive Order shall take effect upon signing.
