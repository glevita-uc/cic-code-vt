      That all persons are born equally free and independent, and have certain natural, inherent, and unalienable rights, amongst which are the enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring, possessing and protecting property, and pursuing and obtaining happiness and safety; therefore no person born in this country, or brought from over sea, ought to be holden by law, to serve any person as a servant, slave or apprentice, after arriving to the age of twenty-one years, unless bound by the person's own consent, after arriving to such age, or bound by law for the payment of debts, damages, fines, costs, or the like.

        163 Vt. 219, 226, 658 A.2d 924, 932 (1995), that this article is not self-executing and does not provide rights to individuals that may be vindicated in a judicial action. Sabia v. State, 164 Vt. 293, 669 A.2d 1187 (1995).
       </p>

        Article 1 of the Vermont Constitution expresses fundamental, general principles that underlie more specific statements of rights and powers set forth elsewhere in the Constitution. Benning v. State, 161 Vt. 472, 641 A.2d 757 (1994).

        By providing both general and specific standards for Planned Residential Development (PRD) review, a bylaw struck an appropriate balance between providing guidance to the planning commission and avoiding inflexible requirements that would defeat the creativity and flexibility required to effectuate the goals of the PRD alternative to traditional development. The list of particular requirements set forth in the bylaw provided sufficient standards for the commission, and for the court upon review, to evaluate a proposed project's compliance with the bylaws while avoiding inflexibility. In re Pierce Subdivision Application, 184 Vt. 365, 965 A.2d 468 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although Chapter I, Article 1 of the Vermont Constitution includes the right to possess and protect property, that right is listed "amongst" the "certain natural, inherent, and unalienable rights"; this suggests that Article I does not establish an enforceable property right, but merely lists it to flesh out philosophical truisms. Shields v. Gerhart, 163 Vt. 219, 658 A.2d 924 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because Chapter I, Article 1 of the Vermont Constitution makes no mention of private plaintiff's recourse for State interference with property rights, Article 1 contains no directive that State Legislature act to implement asserted property right, and drafting history that exists suggests that Constitution is basically philosophic document, evidence did not support plaintiff's contention that Article 1 was intended to be self-executing. Shields v. Gerhart, 163 Vt. 219, 658 A.2d 924 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly dismissed plaintiff's claim for wrongful deprivation of property, which was based on revocation of her day care license by Social and Rehabilitation Services, because Chapter I, Article 1 of the Vermont Constitution is not self-executing and does not provide rights to individuals that may be vindicated in a judicial action. Shields v. Gerhart, 163 Vt. 219, 658 A.2d 924 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff had an adequate remedy for the loss of her day care facility license and denial of her registration application either by administrative appeal to the Human Services Board or, if access to administrative remedies had been unfairly denied, by judicial action. Shields v. Gerhart, 163 Vt. 219, 658 A.2d 924 (1995).

       <p>
        Application of eviction provision of Mobile Home Parks Act to mobile home renters did not violate Vermont Constitution; owners of mobile homes were not prevented from selling them, but rather would have to sell them subject to tenancy of renters, unless one of the grounds for eviction applied. State v. Bisson, 161 Vt. 8, 632 A.2d 34 (1993).

        Guaranties of this article relating to the right of acquiring, possessing, and protecting property, including right of disposal, cease to operate at the death of the possessor. In re Estate of Hagar, 98 Vt. 235, 126 A. 507 (1924).
       </p>
       <p>
        This article does not guarantee citizens an inherent and inalienable right to acquire and possess property without the legislative restraint of taxation. State v. Harrington, 68 Vt. 622, 35 A. 515 (1896).

        The U.S. and State Constitutions do not require the State to prove that a mentally ill patient is "a person in need of treatment" in order for the court to revoke order of nonhospitalization, as the "patient in need of further treatment" complies with due process of law. There is no constitutional barrier to using a predictive dangerousness standard where the patient is receiving adequate treatment, required by statute, and the State has evidence of the result of withdrawal of that treatment. Also, the State must have adequate tools to enforce the conditions of its nonhospitalization order, and due process does not deprive the State of the remedy of rehospitalization where appropriate and necessary. In re P.S., 167 Vt. 63, 702 A.2d 98 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no heightened concern for personal liberty embedded in the Vermont Constitution that would render motorcycle helmet law unconstitutional. Benning v. State, 161 Vt. 472, 641 A.2d 757 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        The State permits appellate review of commitment proceedings, and consequently equal protection requires that indigents involuntarily committed have equal access to the review process, although because cost is a relevant factor, State need not automatically provide a transcript to every indigent in danger of being involuntarily confined, but rather it must provide some means of affording adequate and effective appellate review to indigents. In re L.G., 158 Vt. 639, 603 A.2d 381 (mem.) (1992), overruled in part by In re G.G., In re G.G., 2017 VT 10, 204 Vt.

        Involuntary commitment at State Hospital is a massive curtailment of liberty, and procedures that lead to it must comply with due process. In re L.G., 158 Vt. 639, 603 A.2d 381 (mem.) (1992), overruled in part by In re G.G., 2017 VT 10, 204 Vt.

       <p>
        State constitutional claim that denial of zoning permit and variance applications established plaintiff's property as subservient to public uses was barred where plaintiff failed to appeal the zoning board decisions and instead raised claim on collateral declaratory judgment action. Hinsdale v. Village of Essex Junction, 153 Vt. 618, 572 A.2d 925 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        A valid grant of the power of eminent domain can be made only when the taking is for a public use within the meaning of this article. Deerfield River Co. v. Wilmington Power & Paper Co., 83 Vt. 548, 77 A. 862 (1910).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not necessary to the public use which is essential to a valid exercise of the power of eminent domain that the whole public, or any considerable portion thereof, participate in that use; the use may be, and frequently is, limited to a small locality and yet is public within the meaning of this article. Deerfield River Co. v. Wilmington Power & Paper Co., 83 Vt. 548, 77 A. 862 (1910).
       </p>
       <p>
        The end to be accomplished is the ultimate test of whether a contemplated exercise of the power of eminent domain is for a public use within the meaning of this article, and it is wholly immaterial whether the actuating motive of the enterprise is private gain, or whether the title or control of the property taken is vested in a natural or artificial person. Deerfield River Co. v. Wilmington Power & Paper Co., 83 Vt. 548, 77 A. 862 (1910).
       </p>
       <p>
        This article does not authorize the taking of private property for a mere public benefit. Deerfield River Co. v. Wilmington Power & Paper Co., 83 Vt. 548, 77 A. 862 (1910).
       </p>
       <p>
        Furnishing of electricity to municipalities to light streets and public buildings was a public use within the meaning of this article. Deerfield River Co. v. Wilmington Power & Paper Co., 83 Vt. 548, 77 A. 862 (1910).
       </p>
       <p>
        To invoke the power of eminent domain, the conditions which make the use a public one within the meaning of this article must exist at time of the taking. Avery v. Vermont Electric Co., 75 Vt. 235, 54 A. 179 (1903).
       </p>
       <p>
        Generation of electricity by an individual, for purpose of supplying a railroad with power to operate its road, was not a public use within the meaning of this article. Avery v. Vermont Electric Co., 75 Vt. 235, 54 A. 179 (1903).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this article, private property, upon compensation made in money, is subservient to public uses when necessity requires it, but to no other uses. Tyler v. Beacher, 44 Vt. 648 (1871).
       </p>
       <p>
        Attempt of Legislature to exercise right of eminent domain does not settle that it has the right; the question whether taking was for public use remains to be determined by courts. Tyler v. Beacher, 44 Vt. 648 (1871).
       </p>
       <p>
        Taking of land for location of a district school-house is for a public use, and an act providing for taking land in invitum for that purpose, and having the damages appraised and paid, is not void under this article. Williams v. School District No. 6, 33 Vt. 271 (1860).

         2. Private use.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The right of eminent domain can never be exercised for any merely private purpose, however much the public utility or convenience may be thereby subserved. New England Trout & Salmon Club v. Mather, 68 Vt. 338, 35 A. 323 (1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        The State is not authorized to take private property for private use without the consent of the owner, since this article, by declaring that private property ought to be subservient to public uses when necessity requires it, by implication declares that it ought not to be subservient to any other uses without the consent of the owner. In re Barre Water Co., 62 Vt. 27, 20 A. 109 (1889); Snow v. Town of Sandgate, 66 Vt. 451, 29 A. 673 (1894).

         3. Necessity.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In condemnation proceedings, question of public necessity is one of fact. Rutland Railway, Light & Power Co. v. Clarendon Power Co., 86 Vt. 45, 83 A. 332 (1912).
       </p>
       <p>
        The question of the necessity of taking private property for public use is ultimately a judicial one. Stearns v. City of Barre, 73 Vt. 281, 50 A. 1086 (1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        Existence of necessity is the foundation of the right to take under this article, and ascertainment of necessity should precede or accompany and not follow the taking, since this article guarantees the protection of a right rather than the redress of a wrong. Stearns v. City of Barre, 73 Vt. 281, 50 A. 1086 (1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whenever the use is public, the Legislature has full power to determine whether a necessity for taking for such use in any class of cases exists or not, and has the sole prerogative of determining as to the propriety of exercising the power. Tyler v. Beacher, 44 Vt. 648 (1871).

         4. Taking.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        There was no taking by a city with respect to its sewage/stormwater system, as the sewage backups on plaintiffs' property had been intermittent, limited, and transient. Lorman v. City of Rutland, 207 Vt. 599, 193 A.3d 1174 (June 29, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Landowner was not entitled to relief under a theory of inverse condemnation based on snow throw and water runoff caused by snowplowing done by the Vermont Agency of Transportation. There was no allegation that the Agency had created a permanent physical occupation of landowner's property; the intermittent snow throw and water runoff here was an incidental incursion only and did not represent the kind of invasion that would amount to a taking; and the burden of receiving snow throw and water runoff was distributed among all property owners who abutted properly maintained highways, even if the landowner's building was closer to the road than the buildings of other landowners. Ondovchik Family Limited Partnership v. Agency of Transportation, 187 Vt. 556, 996 A.2d 1179 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        When winter road maintenance activities result in intermittent snow throw and water runoff, it is an incidental incursion only and does not represent the kind of invasion that would amount to a taking. Ondovchik Family Limited Partnership v. Agency of Transportation, 187 Vt. 556, 996 A.2d 1179 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        <i>
         Timms v. State,
        </i>
        139 Vt. 343 (1981), where a landowner's well was destroyed by the State's non-negligent salting of roads, and where this was held to be a taking, is no longer good law. Ondovchik Family Limited Partnership v. Agency of Transportation, 187 Vt. 556, 996 A.2d 1179 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        The prohibition of the Vermont and U.S. Constitutions against takings of private property for public purposes without compensation applies not only when the government takes property for its own use through the formal procedures of eminent domain, but also when government regulation results in the loss of a property interest. Alger v. Department of Labor & Industry, 181 Vt. 309, 917 A.2d 508 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the Takings Clauses of the Vermont and U.S. Constitutions, the property interest lost need not be an ownership interest; a leasehold is an interest in property subject to analysis under the Takings Clause. Moreover, the loss need not be permanent; a temporary taking of property can be compensable. Alger v. Department of Labor & Industry, 181 Vt. 309, 917 A.2d 508 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        The prohibition on takings without compensation is not absolute. An exercise of the police power to abate a public nuisance, and specifically, to abate a fire hazard, is not a compensable taking . . . thus, where the State seeks to sustain regulation that deprives land of all economically beneficial use, it may refuse to compensate a property owner only if the regulation prohibits a use of the land that was "not part of his title to begin with". When the challenged State action is consistent with background principles of the State's law of property and nuisance, no property interest has been taken, and no just compensation is due. Alger v. Department of Labor & Industry, 181 Vt. 309, 917 A.2d 508 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though Vermont law allows a tenant to remain in a dwelling after a landlord's violation of the warranty of habitability, this does not mean that tenants are entitled to remain in a building when doing so threatens the surrounding community, as in cases where occupancy of the building poses a fire hazard. Accordingly, to the extent plaintiffs' claims challenged the ultimate decision of defendant Vermont Department of Labor and Industry to order that their homes be vacated or their utility service be terminated, their allegations did not state valid takings claims. Alger v. Department of Labor & Industry, 181 Vt. 309, 917 A.2d 508 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff tenant's complaint stated valid takings claims where it alleged that defendant Vermont Department of Labor and Industry knew of relevant code violations, and that in the face of the landlords' refusal to take corrective action, it chose to allow the violations to continue until they became serious enough to require removal of the plaintiffs or termination of utility service. But for defendant's failure to act, there would have been no nuisance to abate, and plaintiffs' property would not have been taken. If plaintiffs could prove the allegations, they would be entitled to just compensation. Alger v. Department of Labor & Industry, 181 Vt. 309, 917 A.2d 508 (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        State's denial of property owner's right to access road in winter represented a taking of a property right without compensation, proper remedy for which was an action to recover damages for inverse condemnation. Okemo Mountain, Inc. v. Town of Ludlow, 171 Vt. 201, 762 A.2d 1219 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        A fundamental requirement for any taking is that the challenged governmental action create legal compulsion. Hinesburg Sand & Gravel Co. v. Chittenden Solid Waste District, 959 F. Supp. 652 (D. Vt. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        A "taking for public use," with resulting damages, did not occur where a municipality denied a variance and the denial was reversed on appeal.
    The application of a general zoning law to particular property effects a taking only if the ordinance in question does not substantially advance legitimate state interests or denies an owner of all economically viable use of his land. Chioffi v. City of Winooski, 165 Vt. 37, 676 A.2d 786 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether a regulatory takings claim resulting from an Act 250 denial of a permit application for a development or subdivision is ripe for litigation must be determined by the two-part test set out in
        <i>
         Williamson County Regional Planning Comm'n v. Hamilton Bank,
        </i>
        473 U.S. 172 (1985); the first part of the test determining ripeness for review requires plaintiff to have obtained a final decision regarding the application of the government regulations to plaintiff's property, and the second part requires plaintiff to have utilized State procedures for obtaining just compensation. Killington, Ltd. v. State, 164 Vt. 253, 668 A.2d 1278 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        To have a ripe takings claim, plaintiff must have exhausted all administrative remedies, including variance procedures, and failure to do so results in a takings claim that is not ripe. Killington, Ltd. v. State, 164 Vt. 253, 668 A.2d 1278 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Permanent physical damage to property to the point of depriving the owner of its beneficial use constitutes a taking. Timms v. State, 139 Vt. 343, 428 A.2d 1125 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        The flooding of private property by a municipality constitutes a taking for which the municipality must compensate. Sargent v. Town of Cornwall, 130 Vt. 323, 292 A.2d 818 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        A fire hazard is a nuisance, the abatement of which is not a taking of property for which compensation must be made. Eno v. City of Burlington, 125 Vt. 8, 209 A.2d 499 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        The installation of water line sleeves under limited access facility highways for the benefit of property owners, whose water supply is either included in the taking or is severed by a project, is a taking of property, within the meaning of this article, unless the owner has full and complete access to his water line at all times thereafter. 1962-64 Op. Atty. Gen. 209.
       </p>
       <p>
        Any permanent occupation of private property for public use to exclusion of owner's beneficial use and enjoyment, by eminent domain, is taking within the meaning of this article, and accordingly must be compensated for by the equivalent in money. Demers v. City of Montpelier, 120 Vt. 380, 141 A.2d 676 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        Exercise of police power through revocation of pinball licenses could not be construed as taking of private property for public use without payment of compensation in violation of this article. Sowma v. Parker, 112 Vt. 241, 22 A.2d 513 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        Action of municipal authorities in raising the grade of a street from time to time did not constitute an unlawful taking of private property within meaning of this article. Hoyt v. Village of North Troy, 93 Vt. 8, 105 A. 33 (1918).
       </p>
       <p>
        Municipality, for purpose of repairing a bridge that the law required it to maintain, could insist upon necessary lowering of pond without compensating owner of power dam, because such interference with use of the dam was not a taking of property within meaning of this article. Town of East Montpelier v. Wheelock, 70 Vt. 391, 41 A. 432 (1898).
       </p>
       <p>
        Destruction by public authorities of plaintiff's mill and dam during a freshet, to prevent river from washing out highway, was not a taking of plaintiff's property under this article, but a destruction of it under police power of State to avert imminent public injury. Aitken v. Village of Wells River, 70 Vt. 308, 40 A. 829 (1898).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where railroad company occupied a portion of public highway with its roadbed, an additional burden was thereby imposed upon the land and there was a taking within the meaning of this article. Wead v. St. Johnsbury & Lake Champlain Railroad, 64 Vt. 52, 24 A. 361 (1891).
       </p>
       <p>
        When railroad company, without objection of municipal authorities, made a fill upon a public highway, not for purpose of supporting its road-bed, but to enable public to have access to its station, no additional burden was thereby imposed, and the owner of the fee could not recover damages pursuant to this article. Wead v. St. Johnsbury & Lake Champlain Railroad, 64 Vt. 52, 24 A. 361 (1891).
       </p>

        Any injury to the property of an individual that deprives him of the ordinary use of it is equivalent to a taking within the meaning of this article and entitles him to compensation. Foster v. Stafford National Bank, 57 Vt. 128 (1884).

Nevertheless, every sect or denomination of christians ought to observe the sabbath or Lord's day, and keep up some sort of religious worship, which to them shall seem most agreeable to the revealed will of God.

        Plaintiffs, who had sought a preliminary injunction against the grant of federally derived but municipally managed funds for the purpose of repairs to a historic church, had not shown that they were likely to succeed on the merits of their claim that the grant violated the Compelled Support Clause, as the funds were available to a broad group of potential grantees without regard to religious affiliation, and the grant was limited to painting three exterior sides of the church and assessing its window sills and covered only a fraction of the church's renovation project. Taylor v. Town of Cabot, 205 Vt. 586, 178 A.3d 313 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        With respect to the Compelled Support Clause, where funding is available on a neutral and non-discriminatory basis to a broad and diverse group of potential recipients in order to promote a squarely secular goal of the broader community, there is no indication that the funds are intended to or do advantage religious organizations or activity, and the funds are used for structural repairs rather than, for example, erecting religious symbols, the Vermont Supreme Court cannot conclude that such funds support worship within the meaning of the clause. Taylor v. Town of Cabot, 205 Vt. 586, 178 A.3d 313 (2017).

        Challenge by town clerks to the civil unions law asserting that their obligation under the law to issue a civil union license, or to appoint an assistant to do so, violates their sincerely held religious beliefs under this article failed to allege facts sufficient to state a claim on which relief could be granted.

        In considering religion and religious practices in child custody cases, the State and federal right to free exercise of religion may be implicated; therefore, in balancing the relevant interests, the Supreme Court must minimize the degree of interference with religious liberty and use the least restrictive means to accomplish the legitimate objectives that warrant the interference.

       </p>
       <p>
        In order for a religious practice to be considered in determining child custody, the practice must have a direct and immediate negative impact on the physical or mental health of the child. Varnum v. Varnum, 155 Vt. 376, 586 A.2d 1107 (1990).

        Where medical examiner refused to sign a death certificate for defendant's daughter, a prerequisite for obtaining a burial permit, because defendant refused to allow an autopsy, claiming that his religious beliefs forbade the performance of autopsies, defendant's conviction for burying the body without a burial permit did not violate his right to the free exercise of his religion, since defendant failed to show that his church believed in the practice of burying the dead without autopsies, the record showed that the tenets of defendant's church did not prohibit the performance of autopsies, and thus, defendant's decision not to allow an autopsy was an individual one, based on a particular situation and not a fundamental belief of the members of his church. State v. Chambers, 144 Vt. 234, 477 A.2d 110, cert. denied, 469 U.S. 875, 105 S. Ct. 236, 83 L. Ed. 2d 176 (1984).

       <p>
        Actions that may delay or condition the jury trial right do not by themselves infringe on that right, and a temporary delay in access to a civil jury trial is not equivalent to denial of the right. In re Vermont Supreme Court Administrative Directive No. 17, 154 Vt. 392, 579 A.2d 1036 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Temporary moratorium of approximately five months on all civil jury trials created by a Supreme Court administrative directive in response to reduction in appropriation to support the courts did not offend State constitutional jury trial provisions; petitioners failed to show specific prejudice or that their trials were being delayed unreasonably, and administrative directive gave administrative judge authority to permit exceptions to the moratorium where justice required.

        A threat to file a lawsuit cannot alone constitute tortious interference with contractual relations; both filing a lawsuit and threatening to file a lawsuit are protected by the constitutional right to access the courts. Kollar v. Martin, 167 Vt. 592, 706 A.2d 945 (mem.) (1997).

       <p>
        To curb the more serious abuses of the right to free access to the courts, two carefully restricted torts are recognized: abuse of process and malicious prosecution. Jacobsen v. Garzo, 149 Vt. 205, 542 A.2d 265 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        A claim for tortious interference with contractual relations cannot be predicated upon an allegedly improper filing of a lawsuit; the appropriate remedy, if any, lies in an action for malicious prosecution, because this tort operates to protect the counter-policy of free access to the courts. Jacobsen v. Garzo, 149 Vt. 205, 542 A.2d 265 (1988).

The sanction also required revision to permit plaintiff, pro se, to assert and prove that he was without the means to retain an attorney as necessary to comply with the order, because if plaintiff were indigent or without viable resources, the sanction as written would deny him access to justice.

        Due process requires a judicial hearing prior to recommitment to a State hospital, whether or not requested by the patient, unless immediate recommitment is required because the person poses an imminent danger of harm to himself or another; in cases of immediate recommitment, a hospital staff member familiar with the person's case and current circumstances must state in the recommitment order the specific facts that give rise to the imminent danger, and a constitutionally adequate hearing must be initiated promptly thereafter.

       <p>
        Public's right to attend meetings of public agencies is a truism of a republican form of government; for enforcement of such right plaintiffs must avail themselves of the legislative enactments giving effect to the constitutional principles that officers of government are servants of the people and that the doors of the General Assembly shall be open to the public.

        To the extent that the Access to Public Records Act's exemption from disclosure for "records dealing with the detection and investigation of crime" exempted from disclosure the records relating to a criminal investigation sought here, the Legislature had determined that the principle embodied in Article 6 of the Vermont Constitution did not mandate disclosure. The Court would not second-guess that determination. Rutland Herald v. Vt. State Police, 191 Vt. 357, 49 A.3d 91 (2012).

        To say that Article 6 of the Vermont Constitution is not self-executing is to say that the Legislature may select the means and details of executing the broad principles articulated in Article 6. Thus, the realization of Article 6's philosophical vision is subject to those reasonable practical contours that the Legislature should set forth. Rutland Herald v. Vt.

        Common Benefits Clause of Vermont Constitution differs markedly from federal Equal Protection Clause in its language, historical origins, purpose, and development; while federal amendment may thus supplement protections afforded by Common Benefits Clause, it does not supplant it as first and primary safeguard of rights and liberties of all Vermonters.

        In the absence of discrimination based on how a religious school is operated, a Christian school had no claim to exemption from unemployment compensation contributions under the First Amendment or under the Common Benefits Clause in the Vermont Constitution.

Further, the statute does not unconstitutionally discriminate between independent schools, and those supported by a church, convention, or association. Mid Vermont Christian School v.

        Theory offered to justify discrimination under former 15 V.S.A.
        §
        448, which allowed an adopted person to inherit only from the adopting parents and not collateral relatives, was that collateral or lineal relatives did not consent to the adoption, so that the adoption "contract," although creating a legal relationship between the adoptive parents and the adopted child, could not bind those adoptive relatives who did not have any say in the adoption. However, the contractual theory rested on an impermissible premise that the adopted child is a second-class member of the adoptive family, the discriminatory application of the former statute was not reasonably related to a valid public purpose, and the statute was unconstitutional insofar as it denied adopted children the right to inherit from collateral heirs.

       <p>
        Plaintiff, who was involved in a traffic accident with a State Police officer but was found to have suffered no damages, had not shown deprivation of a common benefit under the Common Benefits Clause, as she had no legally cognizable interest in the officer's prosecution, or any criminal or disciplinary consequences that might ensue. Therefore, she could not show any disparate or arbitrary treatment from others similarly situated. Brown v. State, 206 Vt. 394, 182 A.3d 597 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Common Benefits Clause is self-executing and creates a specific right; it is more than a mere "truism" of republican government. In re Town Highway No. 20, 191 Vt. 231, 45 A.3d 54 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Selectboard invidiously discriminated against a town resident in violation of due process and the Common Benefits Clause based on its repeated failure to provide fair and impartial decisionmaking, the result of a relentless bias against the resident and favoritism toward his neighbors. In re Town Highway No. 20, 191 Vt. 231, 45 A.3d 54 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Monetary relief based on a violation of the Common Benefits Clause was proper when the harm to a town resident consisted of a selectboard's intentional abuse of office over the course of more than a decade through decisions that prevented, obstructed, and delayed his efforts to access his property. These decisions were discriminatory and motivated by self-interest, and therefore violated the resident's rights to due process and equal protection. In re Town Highway No. 20, 191 Vt. 231, 45 A.3d 54 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a town violated a resident's rights under the Common Benefits Clause, the actual harm was not the speculative loss in development value, but the anguish and inconvenience to the resident caused by a biased selectboard and resulting from years of efforts to gain reasonable access to his property, together with any additional costs for road improvements caused by the delay. Accordingly, remand was required to recalculate the damages actually suffered by the resident. In re Town Highway No. 20, 191 Vt. 231, 45 A.3d 54 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        With regard to a constitutional tort action under the Common Benefits Clause, the Vermont Supreme Court does not hold that damages must be afforded when an alternative remedy does not completely compensate the injury. The Court recognizes, rather, that the law supports civil damages when an alternative remedy does not meaningfully compensate the injury. In re Town Highway No. 20, 191 Vt. 231, 45 A.3d 54 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether damages must be made available for the violation of a constitutional right is necessarily determined by the specific facts and legal context in which it arises. In many if not most cases of improper treatment under the Common Benefits Clause, other remedies - equitable, statutory, or otherwise - may well suffice, rendering further litigation either unnecessary or unlikely to succeed. In re Town Highway No. 20, 191 Vt. 231, 45 A.3d 54 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        There are three core elements that must comprise any potential constitutional-tort claim based on a violation of the Common Benefits Clause. First, of course, a plaintiff must show the denial of a common benefit, and in doing so, the plaintiff must show disparate and arbitrary treatment when compared to others similarly situated; second, the plaintiff must show that the denial directly favors another particular individual or group; finally, because a court must defer to any reasonable and just basis supporting a discretionary judgment by a governmental decisionmaker, a plaintiff must demonstrate not only that the decision was wholly irrational and arbitrary, but also that it was actuated by personal motives unrelated to the duties of the defendant's official position, such as ill will, vindictiveness, or financial gain. In re Town Highway No. 20, 191 Vt. 231, 45 A.3d 54 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Requiring the showing of an entirely unjustified personal motive is necessary to bar routine suits aimed merely at forcing a political body to change its decision, not through representative politics, but through judicial action, as a constitutional tort action under the Common Benefits Clause is not designed to review the discretionary decisions of another branch of government but to remedy harms caused when a governmental body acts in a wholly arbitrary and unjustified manner in violation of the Clause. This end is served by requiring a showing that the discriminatory treatment of the plaintiff was not only irrational, but motivated solely by an actual desire to harm the plaintiff or by other unjustified personal motives such as self-enrichment or the enrichment of others. In re Town Highway No. 20, 191 Vt. 231, 45 A.3d 54 (2012).

         13. Education.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Plaintiffs' hypothetical argument - that students in unspecified school districts at some point in the future might not obtain equal educational opportunities due to unequal levels of funding that could result from not obtaining tax incentives or qualifying for small-school grants - was purely speculative and could not be the basis for the court to declare Act 46, regarding the involuntary merger of school districts, unconstitutional under the Common Benefits Clause. Athens Sch. Dist. v. Vt. State Bd. of Educ., - Vt.
    - , 237 A.3d 671 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        The current system for funding public education in Vermont is in violation of the State Constitution. A legitimate governmental purpose cannot be fathomed to justify the gross inequities in educational opportunities produced by this system, with its substantial dependence on local property taxes and resultant wide disparities in revenues available to local school districts. The distribution of a resource as precious as educational opportunity may not have as its determining force the mere fortuity of a child's residence. Brigham v. State, 166 Vt. 246, 692 A.2d 384 (1997), (decided under facts existing before 1997 amendments to Title 16).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the State Constitution does not require exact equality of funding among school districts or prohibit minor disparities attributable to unavoidable local differences, it does prohibit substantial interdistrict funding disparities. Moreover, discrimination in the distribution of a constitutionally mandated right such as education may not be excused merely because a "minimal" or "adequate" level of opportunity is provided to all. The Legislature should act under the Vermont Constitution to make educational opportunity available on substantially equal terms, the specific means of discharging this broadly defined duty being properly left to its discretion. Brigham v. State, 166 Vt. 246, 692 A.2d 384 (1997), (decided under facts existing before 1997 amendments to Title 16).

        A town received constitutionally adequate and reasonable benefits from plaintiffs in connection with a lease of municipally owned property. Specifically, the town received rental payments (although such payments amounted to only $138.60 per year), property taxes on improvements to the land, and the possibility of obtaining title to plaintiffs' house, and the ability to convert the property into a public use upon expiration of the lease.

        Under Common Benefits Clause of Vermont Constitution, State of Vermont could not permissibly exclude same-sex couples from benefit, protection, and security that its laws provided to opposite-sex married couples, since none of the asserted State interests provided a reasonable and just basis for such continued exclusion.

        Same-sex couples were entitled, under Common Benefits Clause of Vermont Constitution, to obtain same benefits and protections afforded by Vermont law to married opposite-sex couples; Court's judgment was suspended, however, and current statutory scheme governing marriages was to remain in effect for a reasonable period of time, to enable Legislature to consider and enact implementing legislation consistent with Court's constitutional mandate.

       <p>
        Amendment to a zoning ordinance was not unconstitutional spot zoning. The amendment did not incite anomalous use but instead allowed the use of parcels to become more similar to current residential uses in residential zoning districts; the amendment had the potential to affect numerous parcels in medium-density residential districts; while an applicant's proposal prompted the amendment, the removal of the limitation applied generally in the medium-density residential districts and would benefit other properties in addition to the applicant's; and the amendment complied with the city's municipal plan by encouraging an increase in residential development through the adaptive reuse of existing structures and gradually reducing nonconforming uses in the city.

        Aggravated murder statute and the first-degree murder statute themselves do not treat any particular individuals or classes of individuals differently; all are equally subject to the same legislatively conferred prosecutorial discretion to proceed under either statute as the circumstances may seem to justify in a given case. Defendants accused of murder during the course of a sexual assault are nowhere deemed or recognized as a protected class, and the risk that one prosecutor may pursue a mandatory life sentence while another may file for a more discretionary sentence in the event of different homicides arising from sexual assault is of no constitutional concern unless the choice results from impermissible racial, ethnic, or gender biases.

        Provision requiring the Human Rights Commission to bring an action against the State within six months does not violate the Common Benefits Clause. The State is not specially protected from lawsuits, as the Commission is free to bring an action against the State at any point in the six-month period; moreover, the six-month time limitation applies not only to actions the Commission brings against the State, but to all the Commission's actions.

       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont Supreme Court accords deference to the policy choices made by the Legislature and finds a six-month time limit for the Human Rights Commission to bring an action against a State agency after failure of conciliation to be reasonable, mandatory, and not in violation of the Common Benefits Clause of the Vermont Constitution. Thus, an action by the Commission against the State was properly dismissed as time-barred. Vermont Human Rights Comm'n v. State, 192 Vt. 552, 60 A.3d 702 (2012).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The Proportional Contribution Clause of this article imposes no greater restriction on governmental action than the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution; thus, the test of validity of governmental action under the Clause is the rational basis test used for federal equal protection analysis. USGen New Eng., Inc. v. Town of Rockingham, 176 Vt. 104, 838 A.2d 927 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Proportional Contribution Clause of this article and the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution impose the same limits on the State's powers of taxation. Burlington Electric Dept. v. Vermont Department of Taxes, 154 Vt. 332, 576 A.2d 450 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Vermont and U.S. Constitutions impose no rule of equality of taxation, for reasonable schemes of taxation must have flexibility and variety; as a result, some discriminatory impact is virtually inevitable. Burlington Electric Dept. v. Vermont Department of Taxes, 154 Vt. 332, 576 A.2d 450 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the Proportional Contribution Clause of this article are the same in effect. Clark v. City of Burlington, 101 Vt. 391, 143 A. 677 (1928); Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co. v. Harvey, 107 Vt. 215, 177 A. 423 (1935); State v. Auclair, 110 Vt. 147, 4 A.2d 107 (1939); In re Estate of Eddy, 135 Vt. 468, 380 A.2d 530 (1977); Pabst v. Commissioner of Taxes, 136 Vt. 126, 388 A.2d 1181, appeal dismissed, 439 U.S. 922, 99 S. Ct. 303, 58 L. Ed. 2d 315 (1978); Leverson v. Conway, 144 Vt. 523, 481 A.2d 1029 (1984), appeal dismissed, 469 U.S. 926, 105 S. Ct. 316, 83 L. Ed. 2d 255 (1984), vacated and remanded, 472 U.S. 1014, 105 S. Ct. 3471, 87 L. Ed. 2d 608 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Limitation imposed by this article does not forbid any classification of property for purpose of taxation, or adoption of any scheme of taxation, that does not offend the U.S. Constitution. Village of Hardwick v. Town of Wolcott, 98 Vt. 343, 129 A. 159 (1925); Clark v. City of Burlington, 101 Vt. 391, 143 A. 677 (1928).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Two fundamental requirements exist for valid imposition of taxes in Vermont: first, any legislative classification of taxpayers must bear a reasonable relation to the purpose for which it is established; and second, the classification scheme must be fairly and equitably applied among like classes of taxpayers. Burlington Electric Dept. v. Vermont Department of Taxes, 154 Vt. 332, 576 A.2d 450 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Test of validity of governmental action under the Proportional Contribution Clause of this article must be rational basis test used for federal equal protection analysis. Alexander v. Town of Barton, 152 Vt. 148, 565 A.2d 1294 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Test of constitutionality under the Proportional Contribution Clause of this article is the rational basis test of the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution. Stoneman v. Vergennes Union High School District #5, 139 Vt. 50, 421 A.2d 1307 (1980), overruled on other grounds, Cronin v. State (1987) 148 Vt. 253, 531 A.2d 929.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The Proportional Contribution Clause of this article is not restricted to any particular subject of taxation, but applies to the entire burden cast upon the taxpayer. In re Hickok's Estate, 78 Vt. 259, 62 A. 724 (1906); In re Estate of Eddy, 135 Vt. 468, 380 A.2d 530 (1977).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Although Legislature must select the subjects of taxation and make that selection effective by necessary regulations for assessment, every species of property need not be specifically named for taxation, general words of description being sufficient. City of St. Albans v. Avery, 95 Vt. 249, 114 A. 31, cert. denied, 257 U.S. 640, 42 S. Ct. 51, 66 L. Ed. 2d 411 (1921).
       </p>
       <p>
        To secure the protection against arbitrary injustice in the imposition of taxes provided by this article, legislative enactments must set up a standard, fix a rule, to be conformed to as a guide in all cases, uniform and certain so far as reasonably practicable, and not susceptible to different applications to different individuals of the class to which it applies. Barnes v. Dyer, 56 Vt. 469 (1884).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute empowering authorities of city to construct sidewalks and make local assessments on the property fronting the same "for so much of the expense thereof as they shall deem just and equitable" was unconstitutional in that there was no fixed, certain, and legal standard for assessment. Barnes v. Dyer, 56 Vt. 469 (1884).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The power of the Legislature to raise and appropriate public funds is limited by this article to public uses. Vermont Home Mortgage Credit Agency v. Montpelier National Bank, 128 Vt. 272, 262 A.2d 445 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the general public benefit is the dominant interest served by an act appropriating public funds, the restraint of this article is not exceeded even though the administration of the act confers a benefit on private institutions or persons. Vermont Home Mortgage Credit Agency v. Montpelier National Bank, 128 Vt. 272, 262 A.2d 445 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the general public benefit is the dominant interest served in enactment providing aid to education, demand of this article that public funds be expended for public purposes is not offended, even though the aid enures to the benefit of a private institution. Vermont Educational Buildings Financing Agency v. Mann, 127 Vt. 262, 247 A.2d 68 (1968), appeal dismissed, 396 U.S. 801, 90 S. Ct. 9, 24 L. Ed. 2d 58 (1969).

        State may make appropriation in discharge of moral obligation resting on it, and such appropriation must be regarded as being for public purpose. Gross v. Gates, 109 Vt. 156, 194 A. 465 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        What is a public purpose within this article is a question for the Legislature, as to which it has large discretion, which the courts can control, if at all, only in exceptional cases. City of Burlington v. Central Vermont Railway, 82 Vt. 5, 71 A. 826 (1909); Vermont Home Mortgage Credit Agency v. Montpelier National Bank, 128 Vt. 272, 262 A.2d 445 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this article, the purpose for which a tax is raised must be a public one. City of Burlington v. Central Vermont Railway, 82 Vt. 5, 71 A. 826 (1909); Gross v. Gates, 109 Vt. 156, 194 A. 465 (1937).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In determining whether a legislative classification of taxpayers violates this article, the Supreme Court does not compare legislative purposes, but rather looks for a reasonable relationship between the classification and its purposes. Burlington Electric Dept. v. Vermont Department of Taxes, 154 Vt. 332, 576 A.2d 450 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The constitutional requirement of proportional contributions for the support of the government was not intended to restrict the State to methods of taxation that operate equally upon all its inhabitants. In re One Church Street, 152 Vt. 260, 565 A.2d 1349 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Listing of nonresidential property at 120% of fair market value pursuant to city charter did not violate this article; tax classification distinguishing nonresidential and residential taxpayers was reasonably related to the valid legislative purpose of raising overall city revenues. In re One Church Street, 152 Vt. 260, 565 A.2d 1349 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the Proportional Contribution Clause of this article, legislative classifications may be imposed, if they are based upon a real and substantial difference, and are not purely arbitrary or irrational. In re Estate of Eddy, 135 Vt. 468, 380 A.2d 530 (1977).

       </p>
       <p>
        This article does not abridge legislative power to make tax exemptions. Colton & More v. City of Montpelier, 71 Vt. 413, 45 A. 1039 (1899); In re Hickok's Estate, 78 Vt. 259, 62 A. 724 (1906); Governor Clinton Council, Inc. v. Koslowski, 137 Vt. 240, 403 A.2d 689 (1979).

        Double taxation is not per se unconstitutional where each imposition of a tax is firmly grounded in legislative intent. Burlington Electric Dept. v. Vermont Department of Taxes, 154 Vt. 332, 576 A.2d 450 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Taxing wood chips burned to produce electricity at an electric generating plant, in addition to taxing the plant's use of electricity it generated, did not amount to impermissible double taxation, since two taxes were imposed on two separate transactions: (1) a tax on the purchase of tangible personal property, wood chips; and (2) a tax on the use of tangible personal property, electricity.

       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that fair market value of plaintiff utility company's property was established by methods other than review of sales of comparable properties does not make equalization ratio inapplicable; where equalization ratios are applied to property assessed at fair market value, constitutional considerations of equal protection and proportional contribution require that they be applied to all property so valued.

Consequently, if a taxpayer demonstrates that the property at issue is assessed at a higher percentage of fair market value than comparable properties, the court must list the taxpayer's property at a corresponding value. This does not mean that a town may not reassess certain properties, but the effect must be uniform. M.T. Associates v. Town of Randolph, 179 Vt. 81, 889 A.2d 740 (October 7, 2005).

        Legislative acts freezing the grand list valuation for hydroelectric generating facilities did not violate the Proportional Contribution Clause of this article. USGen New Eng., Inc. v. Town of Rockingham, 176 Vt. 104, 838 A.2d 927 (2003).

        Trial court did not err affirming property tax assessments of commercial properties located within a specific geographic area of the town based on its finding that the district is an area distinct from other portions of the town and that its unique character showed that the selective reassessment had a rational basis and was not arbitrary or discriminatory. Williams v. Town of Lyndon, 178 Vt. 507, 872 A.2d 341 (mem.) (March 11, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in failing to invalidate reassessment of a district based on its finding that the town's decision to exclude several properties from the reappraisal lacked a rational basis because, despite the court's finding that the reassessment was somewhat underinclusive (in that it excluded certain properties which the court found logically should have been included), it properly declined to invalidate the overall reassessment of the district on that basis.

       <p>
        Town's practice of assigning additional home-site values to permitted subdivisions had a rational basis and was constitutionally valid under the Equal Protection Clause and Vermont's Proportional Contribution Clause. There was a sufficient difference between lots with actual permits in place and lots that were potentially subject to division without a permit to justify the different treatment by the town. Lathrop v. Town of Monkton, 195 Vt. 564, 91 A.3d 378 (Jan. 24, 2014).

        If a taxpayer shows that his property is appraised at a higher percentage of fair market value than comparable properties within the town, the taxpayer's property must be listed at a corresponding value. Kruse v. Town of Westford, 145 Vt. 368, 488 A.2d 770 (1985).

       <p>
        Evidence offered by taxpayer that, for the years 1980 and 1981, his property was appraised at 108% of its 1980 selling price, while all other residential home sales in the town over $50,000 were appraised at an average of 106% and 103% above selling price, did not aid taxpayer's claim that 1982 reappraisal of his property violated this article, since the past selling price of realty did not necessarily equate with its present fair market value and there was no indication on the record that the properties which sold for over $50,000 were comparables.

        In a case where a taxpayer owned noncontiguous parcels of land, one of which contained a home, the other of which was lakefront property, a town had selectively reappraised the property in violation of the Proportional Contribution Clause. Assuming that the reason that the town identified these parcels for reassessment - that separate, noncontiguous properties always sold together and thus should be considered as one more valuable property for tax purposes - it had not come forward with evidence justifying why it did not reassess the homesite and lakefront parcels of numerous other similarly situated property owners.

       </p>
       <p>
        The Proportional Contribution Clause of this article does not mean that a town may not reassess certain properties; however, it does prohibit a town from reassessing property if the effect is a departure from a uniform rate. Heindel v. Town of Grafton, 140 Vt. 147, 435 A.2d 695 (1981).

        When a town had selectively reappraised a taxpayer's property in 2007 in violation of the Proportional Contribution Clause, it would be inappropriate to remand the matter for a hearing on the property's 2007 fair market value, as the taxpayer's property had been subject to revaluation in 2007 when numerous other similarly situated properties inexplicably were not. Instead, the 2006 grand list figure was to be reinstated, and this figure was to become the basis for the grand list for the two next ensuing years. Selectboard, Town of Castleton v.

        Standard for establishing that pre-accusation delay violated the Vermont Constitution is the same as the standard for finding a due process violation under the United States Constitution. A defendant must demonstrate actual substantial prejudice and prosecutorial misconduct intended to gain a tactical advantage or to advance some other impermissible purpose that violates fundamental conceptions of justice or the community's sense of fair play and decency.

       <p>
        Pre-indictment delay did not violate defendant's due process rights under the United States Constitution or the Vermont Constitution. Defendant was not substantially prejudiced by the delay due to the dimming memories of the complainant and a witness and in fact was able to impeach them with their inconsistent statements, and there was no evidence that the State delayed in order to gain a tactical advantage or to advance some other impermissible purpose, but rather it delayed to be certain that the complainant would support the charges and would be willing to proceed with the case.

      That in all prosecutions for criminal offenses, a person hath a right to be heard by oneself and by counsel; to demand the cause and nature of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses; to call for evidence in the person's favor, and a speedy public trial by an impartial jury of the country; without the unanimous consent of which jury, the person cannot be found guilty; nor can a person be compelled to give evidence against oneself; nor can any person be justly deprived of liberty, except by the laws of the land, or the judgment of the person's peers; provided, nevertheless, in criminal prosecutions for offenses not punishable by death, the accused, with the consent of the prosecuting officer entered of record, may in open court or by a writing signed by the accused and filed with the court, waive the right to a jury trial and submit the issue of the accused's guilt to the determination and judgment of the court without a jury.

        Authority to charge aggravated murder, rather than felony murder, was of no more practical concern than the unfettered and broad discretion exercised daily by Vermont prosecutors. Certainly, on the record of this case, which failed to reflect any discriminatory treatment, it was of no constitutional concern either. State v. Rooney, 189 Vt. 306, 19 A.3d 92 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where instructions were clear as to the elements the jurors needed to unanimously find to reach a guilty verdict, and the evidence was sufficient for the jury to have so found with respect to all essential elements of the charges, the general instruction on unanimity was sufficient to safeguard defendant's constitutional rights. State v. Green, 180 Vt. 544, 904 A.2d 87 (mem.) (June 30, 2006).
       </p>

        This article makes no distinction between felonies and misdemeanors in guaranteeing the right of trial by jury, and by the use of the words "criminal offenses" it embraces the two categories. State v. Becker, 130 Vt. 153, 287 A.2d 580 (1972).

        This article has reference to that class of criminal offenses usually denominated "high crimes," the punishment of which affects life, liberty, and reputation, and exposes the offender to infamous corporal suffering; and has no application to those minor offenses that clearly concern the regulation of the internal police of the State.

        Defendant's sentence on remand, which was a year higher than the one he originally received from a different judge, did not violate federal or State due process. Defendant had not argued that the second judge acted with actual vindictiveness, and nothing in the record indicated that she did; indeed, the record indicated that the second judge increased the sentence primarily due to defendant's "staunch refusal to accept responsibility" for his crime, which indicated to her that his prospects for rehabilitation were negligible.

        Defendant failed in his claim that the trial court violated the Vermont and United States Constitutions by enhancing his sentence based on the court's findings of certain aggravating factors because he offered no basis to conclude that there would have been a different result had the jury been required to find the aggravating factors. State v. Stevens, 175 Vt. 503, 825 A.2d 8 (mem.) (2003).

        In a sentencing enhancement hearing, a defendant need not produce court records that affirmatively prove that counsel was denied in prior criminal prosecutions leading to convictions in violation of
        <i>
         State v. DeRosa,
        </i>
        161 Vt. 78, 633 A.2d 277 (1993), if no such records exist.
    To challenge the use of a prior conviction for sentence enhancement purposes based on
        <i>
         DeRosa,
        </i>
        however, a defendant must affirmatively show that counsel was denied improperly, and may not simply rely on a record indicating that counsel was denied and a suspended sentence imposed. State v. Brown, 165 Vt. 79, 676 A.2d 350 (1996).

         6. Rights of juveniles.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Failure of 17-year-old suspect to take advantage of opportunity to consult privately with his father, outside atmosphere of police interrogation room, did not render detective's subsequent interrogation violative of Vermont Constitution. State v. Mears, 170 Vt. 336, 749 A.2d 600 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of the interested adult rule is to guard against improvident waivers of constitutional rights resulting from the minor's lack of sophistication or experience and to guarantee that his decision is as well considered as that of an adult under similar circumstances. State v. Piper, 143 Vt. 468, 468 A.2d 554 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right to consult with an interested, informed, and independent adult before deciding whether to waive or assert the right to counsel and privilege against self-incrimination accrues to a person under the age of 18 at the commencement of a custodial interrogation simultaneously with the right to be given Miranda warnings. State v. Piper, 143 Vt. 468, 468 A.2d 554 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the case of a juvenile who was found guilty of operating a motor vehicle on a public highway in a careless and negligent manner, incriminating statements made by the juvenile to the investigating officer when no interested, informed, and independent adult was present were not erroneously admitted into evidence, since the juvenile went to the police station where he made the statements voluntarily, was not under arrest or detention, was at all times during the investigation free to leave, and, therefore, was not "in custody" at the time the incriminating statements were made. State v. Piper, 143 Vt. 468, 468 A.2d 554 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this article a juvenile may waive his privilege against self-incrimination and his right to counsel only if the following conditions have been met: (1) he must be given the opportunity to consult with an adult; (2) the adult must be one who is not only genuinely interested in the welfare of the juvenile but completely independent from and disassociated with the prosecution, e.g., a parent, legal guardian, or attorney representing the juvenile; and (3) the independent interested adult must be informed and be aware of the rights guaranteed to the juvenile. In re E. T. C., 141 Vt. 375, 449 A.2d 937 (1982); State v. Piper, 143 Vt. 468, 468 A.2d 554 (1983).

       </h5>
       <p>
        A preindictment lineup is not the equivalent of a criminal prosecution and does not trigger a right to counsel under the Vermont Constitution. State v. Parizo, 163 Vt. 103, 655 A.2d 716 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        The rights contained in the public defender act are not directly applicable to the right in the implied consent law to consult counsel before deciding whether to take a blood-alcohol test; the public defender act implements the general right to counsel provided by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution as well as Article 10 of Chapter I of the Vermont Constitution while the right to consult with counsel contained in the implied consent law is purely statutory, created by 23 V.S.A.
        §
        1202(c), and is not constitutionally mandated because the decision whether to take the breath test is not a critical stage of the prosecution. State v. Fuller, 163 Vt. 523, 660 A.2d 302 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Ex parte granting of an order for a taking of a blood sample does not violate defendant's right to counsel, since the taking of a nontestimonial identification evidence is not a critical stage at which the right to counsel attaches. State v. Kennison, 149 Vt. 643, 546 A.2d 190 (1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1011, 108 S. Ct. 1743, 100 L. Ed. 2d 206 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The taking of nontestimonial evidence is not a critical stage of criminal proceedings to which the right to counsel under this article attaches. State v. Howe, 136 Vt. 53, 386 A.2d 1125 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        A respondent who pleads guilty to an offense is as much entitled to advice of counsel as one who denies the charge. In re Moses, 122 Vt. 36, 163 A.2d 868 (1960), overruled on other grounds, In re Dobson (1965) 125 Vt. 165, 212 A.2d 620.

         21. Effective assistance.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Petitioner inmate's post-conviction claim of ineffective assistance of counsel, which was filed before the expiration of his sentence for the challenged conviction, was not rendered moot by the inmate's release from custody prior to a determination on the merits. In re Chandler, 193 Vt. 246, 67 A.3d 261 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        None of trial counsel's alleged deficiencies prejudiced petitioner. The sentencing court was presented with substantial evidence of the victim's history of alcohol-induced violence, and any additional testimony on the subject by petitioner or others would have been cumulative. In re Kimmick, 194 Vt. 53, 72 A.3d 337 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner was not prejudiced by counsel's alleged ineffectiveness. There was no showing that petitioner was misinformed about evidence at sentencing or that petitioner was prejudiced by any omissions in his statement to the court, and there was no prejudicial misunderstanding by trial counsel as to the nature of the plea. In re Kimmick, 194 Vt. 53, 72 A.3d 337 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner was not entitled to postconviction relief on the grounds that he had received ineffective assistance of counsel and that his guilty pleas were not entered knowingly and voluntarily. Under the case law at the time, it was reasonable for counsel to doubt the merit of raising a multiplicity challenge to the child pornography statute; because this assessment was not unreasonable, it did not create a material misunderstanding upon which petitioner based his guilty pleas. In re Kirby, 192 Vt. 640 (mem.), 58 A.3d 230 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner inmate's counsel was not ineffective for failing to pursue bifurcation of the inmate's criminal trial into phases involving guilt and insanity, or to inform the inmate of that possibility, as counsel credibly testified that the inmate had adamantly refused to pursue the insanity defense. In re Combs, 190 Vt. 559, 27 A.3d 318 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial counsel was ineffective when she failed to obtain expert testimony to refute the most important - and weakest - element in the State's case: whether petitioner fired his gun at the complaining witness. Because intent to injure was the central element to a charge of aggravated assault, the issue of shot direction was vital to the State's case; counsel actually bolstered the State's case by eliciting damaging testimony from a State's witness, and she hamstrung petitioner's case by lacking rebuttal evidence to support the contention that directionality could not be determined based on a muzzle flash. In re Russo, 187 Vt. 367, 991 A.2d 1073 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial counsel's decisions not to cross-examine prosecution witness, or to file motion in limine regarding evidence of threat to witness, did not fall below applicable standard of competency. In re Miller, 168 Vt. 585, 718 A.2d 422 (mem.) (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        A defendant who raises a challenge to his conviction on the basis of ineffective assistance of counsel must show by a preponderance of the evidence: (1) that counsel's conduct fell below the prevailing standard of competency, and (2) that this failure to meet the standard contributed to the adverse outcome. In re Trombly, 160 Vt. 215, 627 A.2d 855 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Counsel's representation was within range of acceptable assistance when, in advocating client's chosen strategy to limit possible verdicts, counsel urged court to exclude manslaughter instruction and instruct only on first and second degree murder. In re Trombly, 160 Vt. 215, 627 A.2d 855 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        A criminal defendant's right to reasonably effective assistance of counsel is guaranteed by both State and U.S. Constitutions, and court will apply same test under each Constitution to determine whether right has been violated. In re Ross, 158 Vt. 122, 605 A.2d 524 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        A defendant challenging adequacy of his counsel's assistance must show by preponderance of evidence that counsel's conduct fell below prevailing standard of a reasonably competent attorney, and that failure to meet that standard prejudiced defendant such that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, result of proceeding would have been different. In re Ross, 158 Vt. 122, 605 A.2d 524 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defense counsel's failure to object to expert testimony regarding credibility of child victim at sexual assault trial constituted ineffective assistance requiring new trial, where counsel had raised and briefed that issue before trial, State had conceded before trial that such testimony was improper, and there was a reasonable probability the outcome would have been different had counsel objected, since expert testified at end of case and improperly bolstered victim's testimony. In re Ross, 158 Vt. 122, 605 A.2d 524 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        A defendant who challenges adequacy of counsel's assistance must show by a preponderance of evidence, first, that counsel's conduct does not measure up to prevailing standard of reasonably competent attorney, and second, that counsel's failure to meet standard prejudiced defendant such that there is a reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, result of proceeding would have been different. In re Ringler, 158 Vt. 118, 605 A.2d 522 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Issue of whether counsel errors in trial for lewd and lascivious conduct satisfied constitutional standard for ineffective assistance of counsel was remanded, since Superior Court failed to consider both prongs of test and that court was most appropriate judge of errors' weight. In re Ringler, 158 Vt. 118, 605 A.2d 522 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        A claim of ineffective assistance of counsel under this article must demonstrate a lack of reasonable competence and prejudice proven by a preponderance of the evidence. In re Fisher, 156 Vt. 448, 594 A.2d 889 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner was denied effective assistance of counsel where attorney advised petitioner to plead guilty and did not move to suppress statement petitioner made during custodial interrogation after his request to call an attorney was refused. In re Bruyette, 150 Vt. 557, 556 A.2d 568 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The standard employed for reviewing the effectiveness of counsel under this article is that of reasonable competence as measured by the prevailing standards in the conduct of the defendant's case. In re Kasper, 142 Vt. 31, 451 A.2d 1125 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right to counsel means the right to effective assistance to counsel and applies whether counsel is retained by the accused or appointed by the court. State v. Rushford, 127 Vt. 105, 241 A.2d 306 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Assigned counsel must have sufficient ability and experience to fairly represent defendant, to present his defense, and to protect his rights. State v. Rushford, 127 Vt. 105, 241 A.2d 306 (1968).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Defendant's waiver of his right to counsel was valid, where he was ineligible for a public defender and his actions indicated that he wanted counsel and understood his right to counsel, but made a conscious choice based on his financial situation to represent himself. State v. Stenson, 169 Vt. 590, 738 A.2d 567 (mem.) (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Constitutional protections available in criminal proceedings do not attach to statutory right to counsel under implied consent statute, either at the time a breath sample is requested, or at a subsequent license-suspension hearing, and therefore
        <i>
         Miranda
        </i>
        warnings do not apply to blood or chemical tests requested or taken under Vermont's implied consent law. State v. Nemkovich, 168 Vt. 8, 712 A.2d 899 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Both the Vermont and United States Constitutions provide an accused a right to counsel, but the right can be waived if the waiver is made knowingly and intelligently; however, waiver of this right will not be inferred from doubtful conduct, and courts will indulge every reasonable presumption against waiver. State v. Bean, 163 Vt. 457, 658 A.2d 940 (1995).

        A defendant is entitled to conduct his own trial, before a jury, if that be his choice, unless he is incompetent or incapable of making a rational decision on the matter. State v. Bliss, 133 Vt. 324, 340 A.2d 76 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        A defendant in a criminal trial has a right under this article to defend himself without counsel provided he voluntarily and intelligently elects to do so. State v. Hartman, 134 Vt. 64, 349 A.2d 223 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        A knowing and intelligent waiver of counsel depends on the particular facts and circumstances surrounding the case, including the background, experience, and conduct of the accused, and if he is ignorant of the available options necessary to protect his rights and is unaware of the nature of the charges and the range of the allowable punishment at the time of his decision to present himself, the waiver is invalid and is not made knowingly and intelligently. State v. Hartman, 134 Vt. 64, 349 A.2d 223 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Silence alone will never constitute a waiver of the right to counsel. In re Huard, 125 Vt. 189, 212 A.2d 640 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        Waiver of counsel may not be found from a mere plea of guilty, or from the appearance of defendant without counsel, or from failure to request counsel, or from a record which is completely silent on this point. In re Huard, 125 Vt. 189, 212 A.2d 640 (1965).

        The right to counsel under this article may be waived, if done competently and intelligently. In re Mears, 124 Vt. 131, 198 A.2d 27 (1964).

        There had been no claim of surprise or prejudice where the information charging leaving the scene of an accident did not contain the word "immediately," nor could there be. The information and accompanying affidavit clearly explained the charged conduct and related it directly to the statute in question; defendant's ability to prepare his defense was in no way influenced. State v. Neisner, 189 Vt. 160, 16 A.3d 597 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Information charging leaving the scene of an accident was not insufficient under the Vermont Constitution because it did not contain the word "immediately." The plain meaning of the phrase "following the crash" and the allegation that there had been a serious injury to which defendant "did not render any assistance reasonably necessary" made clear that the State was not charging defendant with violating the statute by later driving past the scene after he had originally fled or when a trooper questioned him at his home. State v. Neisner, 189 Vt. 160, 16 A.3d 597 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff's complaint alleged only that defendants denied her "procedural and substantive due process and liberty in violation of the . . . Vermont constitution[]," her allegation did not fairly apprise defendants that her claim arose under Article 4 because it could also be construed to refer to this article; thus, it could not be said that the grounds upon which plaintiff's State constitutional claims rested were readily discernible from the face of the complaint, and the trial court did not err by dismissing the claims for lack of specificity. Mellin v. Flood Brook Union School District, 173 Vt. 202, 790 A.2d 408 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Information charging parents with violation of truancy statute was not defective for failure to allege all essential elements of the crime; affidavit accompanying the information negated all statutory exceptions to the offense of truancy and parents had sufficient notice of the charges to form a defense.

       <p>
        An information must set forth charges with such particularity as will reasonably indicate the exact offense the accused is charged with, and will enable her to make intelligent preparation for her defense; to satisfy the requirement, an essential fact, affecting the degree of punishment, must be alleged in the information. State v. Bradley, 145 Vt. 492, 494 A.2d 129 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        An information is sufficient if it sets forth charges with such particularity as will reasonably indicate the exact offense the accused is charged with, and will enable her to make intelligent preparation for her defense, and this is not a subjective inquiry as to what the accused actually understood, but rather a scrutiny of the charge, as made, to determine what offense is reasonably indicated by its language.

       </p>
       <p>
        The complaint or other form of accusation of a criminal offense must set forth charges with such particularity as will reasonably indicate the exact offense the accused is charged with, and will enable him to make intelligent preparation for his defense.

       <p>
        Information stating several specific criminal offenses involving operation of motor vehicles with an "x" in box before offense of operating vehicle in excess of legal posted speed limit lacked certainty and particularity required by this article and was fatally defective in failing to inform defendant convicted of operating vehicle in excess of legal posted speed limit of exact charge against.

        An offense is sufficiently charged by using the words of a statute if every fact necessary to constitute the offense is charged or necessarily implied by those words; but if, from the nature of the offense, the words of the statute do not clearly and definitely apprise the accused of the offense charged, greater particularity is required. State v. Persons, 114 Vt. 435, 46 A.2d 854 (1946); State v. Woodmansee, 128 Vt. 467, 266 A.2d 448 (1970).

         60. Purpose of right.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The primary objective of the right to confront witnesses is to assure, where possible, personal examination and cross-examination of the witnesses, in which the accused has an opportunity not only to test their recollection and sift their conscience, but also to compel them to stand face to face with the jury in order that the jury may look at them and judge by their demeanor and manner of testimony whether they are worthy of belief. State v. Berard, 132 Vt. 138, 315 A.2d 501, cert. denied, 417 U.S. 950, 94 S. Ct. 3078, 41 L. Ed. 2d 671 (1974).

         61. Scope of right.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Since the excluded evidence here was admissible, and was directed toward undermining the credibility of the State's sole direct witness, the right to confrontation was implicated. State v. Herring, 189 Vt. 211, 19 A.3d 81 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the State has provided a remedy in the Open Meeting law, 1 V.S.A.
        §§
        310-314, for violations of the rights to observe and participate in the discussion and decision making of local government, a plaintiff cannot maintain a suit for damages for the same injury under Article 10. Berlickij v. Town of Castleton, 248 F. Supp. 2d 335 (D. Vt. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        The protection provided by the Confrontation Clause of the Vermont Constitution is of no greater scope than that afforded by the Sixth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. State v. Roberts, 154 Vt. 59, 574 A.2d 1248 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right to confrontation is basically a trial right which includes both the opportunity to cross-examine and the occasion for the jury to weigh the demeanor of the witness. State v. Sprague, 144 Vt. 385, 479 A.2d 128 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right to confront witnesses includes a right to establish identity of the witness so that jury can place him in his environment, know who he is, and weigh his evidence. State v. Berard, 132 Vt. 138, 315 A.2d 501, cert. denied, 417 U.S. 950, 94 S. Ct. 3078, 41 L. Ed. 2d 671 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Right of defendant to confront witnesses against him is specifically related to criminal prosecutions, trials where guilt or innocence of an accused is at issue, and such right is not an essential ingredient in court's determination of punishment of a person whose guilt has already been determined. State v. Morse, 126 Vt. 314, 229 A.2d 232 (1967).

         62. Cross-examination.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for aggravated sexual assault, the trial court did not err when it limited defendant's cross-examination of the victim, based on her prior deposition testimony, because the possibility of confusion to the witness and to the jury from asking a young child about matters that she had never been directly questioned about before outweighed the evidence's power to impeach. State v. Hill, 174 Vt. 566, 816 A.2d 440 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        In appeal by electroencephalogram technician convicted on six counts of sexual misconduct against women hospital patients who suffered from mental disorders, argument was rejected that defendant was denied his right to effective cross-examination when the trial court refused defendant both access to the complainants' psychiatric records, and to conduct an independent examination and evaluation of complainants; defendant received all the medical information (including limited access to hospital discharge and evaluation reports covering the time after the alleged assaults, and depositions of eleven psychiatrists, psychologists, and counselors concerning the complainants' mental condition and competency) that he was entitled to through discovery and cross-examination, and despite the complainants' mental disorders and some inconsistencies in details of their stories, there was substantial evidence that the stories were not fabricated so that each patient's mental disorders were not particularly relevant under the circumstances. State v. Tonzola, 159 Vt. 491, 621 A.2d 243 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse its discretion by refusing to permit defendant to reopen cross-examination of witness five days after he had testified, for the purpose of exploring issues raised during direct and cross-examination of the witness on the first day of trial, where there was no reason that the questioning could not be completed fully during the initial cross-examination. State v. Valley, 153 Vt. 380, 571 A.2d 579 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Threshold question in examining Confrontation Clause claim is whether defendant was prohibited from engaging in otherwise appropriate cross-examination. State v. French, 152 Vt. 72, 564 A.2d 1058 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's ruling, that cross-examination of witness regarding bad check charge that had been dropped after the amount of the checks had been paid was prejudicial, was within its discretion and did not violate defendant's right to confrontation. State v. French, 152 Vt. 72, 564 A.2d 1058 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's ruling sustaining prosecution's objection to cross-examination of witness to show inconsistency in her testimony did not violate defendant's right to confrontation, where question requiring witness to repeat her statement at earlier trial that account of facts during deposition was closer to truth than statements made during the trial was more prejudicial than probative and was cumulative, and defense counsel's other question of witness inquired into veracity. State v. French, 152 Vt. 72, 564 A.2d 1058 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        In child sexual assault case where trial court permitted defendant to cross-examine prosecution's expert witness about whether, in her opinion, a prior sexual assault by another person might have been an alternative cause of the victim's post-traumatic stress disorder, refusal to allow defendant to cross-examine the victim about the prior sexual assault did not deny defendant his right of confrontation. State v. Catsam, 148 Vt. 366, 534 A.2d 184 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        The crux of a Confrontation Clause violation is the lack of an effective opportunity to cross-examine the person whose statement is being used against the defendant. State v. Paquette, 146 Vt. 1, 497 A.2d 358 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no Confrontation Clause violation where there was no denial of an opportunity to cross-examine the witnesses, even though the effectiveness of such cross-examination was limited because of the witnesses' failure of memory. State v. Paquette, 146 Vt. 1, 497 A.2d 358 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right to confront witnesses is an adoption of the common law, and insofar as this right covers cross-examination, it is subject to the common law exceptions and limitations. State v. Berard, 132 Vt. 138, 315 A.2d 501, cert. denied, 417 U.S. 950, 94 S. Ct. 3078, 41 L. Ed. 2d 671 (1974).

         63. Exceptions.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Exception to confrontation requirement when a witness is unavailable and has given testimony at a prior proceeding applies when the prior testimony was given under circumstances closely approximating those that surround the typical trial; these circumstances include: the declarant testified under oath; the defendant was represented by counsel; the defendant had the opportunity to cross-examine the declarant; and the proceedings were conducted before a judicial tribunal that recorded the hearing. State v. Sprague, 144 Vt. 385, 479 A.2d 128 (1984).

         64. Compulsory process.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The burden is on defendant to show that the proffered testimony meets the criteria of competency, relevancy, and materiality and because defendant did not carry that burden, there was no error in failing to enforce a subpoena against a federal officer and no constitutional violation. State v. Rideout, 182 Vt. 113, 933 A.2d 706 (July 20, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Compulsory process is mandated only where the witness to be called will offer testimony that is competent, relevant, and material to the defense. State v. Kennison, 149 Vt. 643, 546 A.2d 190 (1987), cert. denied, 486 U.S. 1011, 108 S. Ct. 1743, 100 L. Ed. 2d 206 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Compulsory process for obtaining witnesses guaranteed by this article is only required where the witnesses to be called will offer competent and material testimony. State v. Kelly, 131 Vt. 582, 312 A.2d 906 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right of an accused to obtain witnesses in his behalf guaranteed by this article does not require a court to issue compulsory process for anyone whom an accused may designate as a witness; such process is only required for competent and material witnesses whose expected testimony will be material to the defense. State v. Dragon, 130 Vt. 334, 292 A.2d 826 (1972).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Defendant's right to confrontation was not violated by the admission of laboratory reports as business records. They were procured at the instigation of defendant and his employer, not by police, almost a year before criminal charges were filed; the fact that the information could conceivably be used for future litigation did not establish that it was prepared for litigation rather than in the normal course of the laboratory's business. State v. Erwin, 189 Vt. 502, 26 A.3d 1 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prohibiting defendant from presenting the full range of evidence on an incident where the complainant stated that she vomited profusely when defendant had her drink an over-the-counter remedy after forcing her to perform oral sex, the trial court not only blocked an arguably valid tactical decision, but also foreclosed defendant from his constitutional right to confrontation. The ruling was not justified by avoidance of undue prejudice to defendant, since it was directly waived by defendant's own request, and was unexplained by the trial court in terms of other balancing to exclude relevant evidence. State v. Herring, 189 Vt. 211, 19 A.3d 81 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant, whose probation was dependent on his meeting certain requirements, including one requiring him to remain within the State unless he had his probation officer's permission to leave, was denied his right to confront the witness as provided by the Confrontation Clause when an out-of-state police officer's affidavit, rather than the officer in person, was presented at a violation-of-parole hearing to prove that defendant had violated the travel conditions of his parole. State v. Austin, 165 Vt. 389, 685 A.2d 1076 (1996).

       <p>
        Trial court does not commit plain error by admitting, upon the parties' stipulation, a videotaped deposition in lieu of the declarant's live testimony. Accordingly, defendant could not now claim error under the Confrontation Clause regarding the course of action he impliedly, if not explicitly, agreed to, and there was no basis for finding plain error; furthermore, defendant did not explain how he was prejudiced by admission of the victim's recorded statements.

        In a prosecution for the sale of marijuana, the trial court erred by limiting defendant's cross-examination of a detective regarding an informant's actions in connection with drug purchases. State v. Findlay, 171 Vt. 594, 765 A.2d 483 (mem.) (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's decision to admit testimony about third person's claims to have killed victim, while limiting certain testimony about circumstances in which statements were made, properly balanced risk of confusing issues and misleading jury against defendant's constitutional right to present exculpatory evidence. State v. Corliss, 168 Vt. 333, 721 A.2d 438 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        An affidavit of a New Hampshire police officer, which served as evidence in a violation-of-parole hearing that defendant had violated parole and left the State without permission as witnessed by New Hampshire officer who stopped defendant in a traffic stop, did not bear the traditional indicia of reliability that would permit admissibility of the affidavit over a valid objection on confrontation grounds. State v. Austin, 165 Vt. 389, 685 A.2d 1076 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence concerning involvement of third party in the burglary and assault for which defendant was on trial was properly rejected where there was no evidence to incriminate the third party directly and the proffered evidence was likely only to confuse or mislead the jury. State v. Gilman, 158 Vt. 210, 608 A.2d 660 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right to present exculpatory evidence entitles a defendant to call witnesses and present evidence on his behalf, but the evidence must be otherwise admissible. State v. Gilman, 158 Vt. 210, 608 A.2d 660 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Exculpatory evidence tending to show a third party's involvement in a crime should be admitted as long as motive and opportunity have been shown and there is also some evidence to directly connect the third person to the crime charged. State v. Gilman, 158 Vt. 210, 608 A.2d 660 (1992).

        In prosecution for rape, trial court's exclusion of expert testimony, pertaining to accuracy of victim's identification of the attacker, did not violate defendant's constitutional rights to present evidence in his own defense.

         101. Factors for determining violation of right.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Defendant's speedy trial rights under the Sixth Amendment and the Vermont Constitution had not been violated by the 23-month delay. Only five months of the delay were clearly attributable to the State, and while defendant timely asserted his speedy trial right, he was out on bail the entire time and had identified few specific claims of prejudice. State v. Reynolds, 196 Vt. 113, 95 A.3d 973 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence concerning involvement of third party in the burglary and assault for which defendant was on trial was properly rejected where there was no evidence to incriminate the third party directly and the proffered evidence was likely only to confuse or mislead the jury. State v. Gilman, 158 Vt. 210, 608 A.2d 660 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was not denied speedy trial where allegation of prejudice was unsupported, defendant never asserted speedy trial right, 6 1/2 months between arraignment and trial was only short period beyond administrative order standard for prompt disposition of criminal cases, defendant was not incarcerated, and delay was caused by difficulty in scheduling long trial. State v. Venman, 151 Vt. 561, 564 A.2d 574 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        There are four factors that are relevant in determining when a denial of the right to a speedy trial has occurred: the length of the delay, the reason for the delay, defendant's assertion of his or her right, and prejudice to the defendant. State v. Recor, 150 Vt. 40, 549 A.2d 1382 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        In examining a claim that speedy trial rights have been violated, at least four factors are relevant: length of the delay, reason for the delay, defendant's assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant. State v. Snide, 144 Vt. 436, 479 A.2d 139 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        A court confronted with a motion for dismissal on the ground that the defendant has been deprived of a speedy trial must make its decision on a balancing test in which the conduct of both the prosecution and the defendant must be weighed, and the factors that should be considered are the length of the delay, reason for delay, defendant's assertion of his right, and prejudice to the defendant.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Given that defendant largely brought delay upon himself through his motion practice and refusal of earlier trial dates, defendant was not denied a speedy trial. State v. Burke, 192 Vt. 99, 54 A.3d 500 (2012), cert. denied, 568 U.S. 1072, 133 S. Ct. 795, 184 L. Ed. 2d 588 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the delay in trial was caused as much by the failure of the defendant to prepare his defense as it was on the State to move for a speedier trial and defendant was afforded a trial in less than a month from the time he first started to prepare his defense and there was no showing he was hindered in efforts to prepare a defense or that the delay had caused him anxiety, concern, or embarrassment, the delay involved was not a denial of the right of speedy trial. State v. Dragon, 130 Vt. 570, 298 A.2d 856 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Accused was not denied a speedy trial, harassed, or subjected to oppressive use of the State's accusative powers where he was indicted for manslaughter on Nov. 4, 1968, the case was set for hearing on Dec. 10, 1968, and the State nol-prossed it on that date and immediately filed an information charging manslaughter and four other offenses, and accused, following denial of his motion to quash the information, appealed by interlocutory order, which resulted in the lower court proceeding being delayed pending decision of that appeal.

       </p>
       <p>
        Although the primary burden is on the courts and prosecutors to assure that cases are brought to trial, the failure of a defendant to assert his right to a speedy trial will make it difficult for him to prove that he was denied such a right. State v. Dragon, 130 Vt. 570, 298 A.2d 856 (1972).

        Defendant's claim that he was subjected to anxiety, embarrassment, and loss of employment because he was compelled to wait an inordinate amount of time before his case came to trial amounted to nothing more than an unsupported assertion that delay is per se prejudicial and was not sufficient to show prejudice.

        At trial for simple assault in which only one alternate juror was impaneled, where defense counsel orally stipulated on the record to proceed with an 11-member jury if necessary during bench conference out of defendant's presence and stipulation was confirmed in defendant's presence, defendant was not deprived of his right to a jury trial under this article.

        Murder defendant's right to an impartial jury was properly protected by the trial court, which conducted both general and individual voir dire of the jury to determine whether or not seeing three spectators wearing T-shirts with the victim's name had in fact created bias among the jurors and determined that the jurors remained unbiased. Even if defendant had filed the proper challenges to certain jurors for cause, which was the proper procedural route instead of a motion for mistrial because the jurors had not yet been impaneled, the result was the same. State v. Herrick, 190 Vt. 292, 30 A.3d 1285 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        State constitutional guarantee to a fair cross-section in the jury selection process does not provide any greater protection than that afforded by the U.S. Constitution, and requires defendant to show prejudice in order to successfully challenge a jury array.

       <p>
        The power of the trial court to remove a juror in proper circumstances does not mean that either side is entitled to have removed any juror who, by some act or remark made during trial, has given the impression that he favors one side or the other; in order for trial court's discharge of a juror to stand, due inquiry and specific findings, on the record, must be made. State v. Villeneuve, 155 Vt. 360, 584 A.2d 1123 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, after closing arguments and before jury charge, the trial court in an assault and robbery case conducted in chambers conference with counsel and a court officer who had raised a question as to a juror's impartiality, the trial court's discharge of the juror on the "remote possibility" she might lack impartiality without examination of her on the record violated defendant's State constitutional right to a jury trial and required reversal. State v. Villeneuve, 155 Vt. 360, 584 A.2d 1123 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        For purposes of constitutional challenge to jury selection process, State constitutional provisions that guarantee criminal defendants a right to an impartial jury and that provide that the right to jury trial should be held sacred afforded no greater protection than Sixth Amendment of the U.S. constitution.

       <p>
        Since due process is involved in the right to a trial before an impartial jury, the law is sensitive to any infringement or impairment. State v. Ovitt, 126 Vt. 320, 229 A.2d 237 (1967); In re Mandeville, 144 Vt. 608, 481 A.2d 1048 (1984).

        Written waiver of jury trial, signed by defendant and counsel, which shows an understanding of the right to be waived, is sufficient to establish a knowing, intelligent, and voluntary waiver, in absence of evidence to contrary. State v. Conn, 152 Vt. 99, 565 A.2d 246 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is better practice for trial court to engage defendant wishing to waive right to jury trial in a colloquy, on the record, to determine whether the waiver is voluntary, knowing, and intelligently made. State v. Conn, 152 Vt. 99, 565 A.2d 246 (1989).

       </p>

        Under this article, it must affirmatively appear from a writing signed by the defendant, or from the oral record made in open court, that the defendant personally indicated, understandingly, his desire to waive jury trial. State v. Ibey, 134 Vt. 140, 352 A.2d 691 (1976).
       </p>

       <p>
        New trial on the false information count was required. Neither the charge nor the State's trial evidence identified precisely what information the jury needed to evaluate with respect to this count, and given defendant's multiple statements and the two distinct ways in which a violation of the statute could occur, the court could not be certain that the jury unanimously agreed that all, or at least one, of defendant's statements met the same statutory elements. State v. Redmond, - Vt.
    - , 234 A.3d 958 (May 15, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's instruction on first-degree aggravated assault tracked the language of the statute and contained definitions for both recklessness and willfulness, gave the jury the diminished capacity instruction requested by defendant, and explicitly instructed the jurors to consider whether defendant's intoxication negated his ability to form willful intent. Further, because the instructions were clear that the jury was only to consider diminished capacity with willful intent and because there was nothing restricting recklessness to be considered in the alternative, the jury was necessarily unanimous on the intent element. State v. Peatman, 207 Vt. 97, 185 A.3d 1257 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because all of the alleged acts took place over a span of six minutes as part of one continuous assault, the case fit within the exception to the election rule in multiple-act acts because the acts were inextricably intertwined as one continuous offense. Therefore, the trial court's initial instructions, which included a list of alleged acts that the trial court suggested the jury consider, and its answer to the jury question, which clarified that the jury did not have to elect specific acts and instead had to be unanimous that the element was proven beyond a reasonable doubt, preserved defendant's right to a unanimous verdict and were not in error. State v. Peatman, 207 Vt. 97, 185 A.3d 1257 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        In not requiring unanimity on the issue of the three possible mental states that could support a voluntary manslaughter conviction, the trial court did not violate defendant's rights under the Vermont Constitution, even if defendant had not waived the issue. The three mental states of intent to kill, intent to do great bodily harm, and wanton disregard of the likelihood of death or great bodily harm were merely other ways to demonstrate defendant had the requisite intent; thus, as long as all jurors were unanimous on the ultimate issue of intent, which of the three alternative methods used to inform each decision as to intent was immaterial. State v. Boglioli, 190 Vt. 542, 26 A.3d 44 (mem.) (2011).

       <p>
        There was no plain error violation of defendant's right to a unanimous jury verdict based on a single offense where defendant's participation with his brothers in a burglary and assault constituted a single, uninterrupted criminal transaction and where the jury was entitled to convict defendant as jointly culpable for the acts of his brothers. State v. Gilman, 158 Vt. 210, 608 A.2d 660 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right to a unanimous verdict based on a single offense requires that in circumstances where there is evidence of more than one act that would constitute the offense charged, the State must specify the act for which it seeks a conviction.

       </p>
       <p>
        Jury instructions in kidnapping case violated requirement of unanimous jury verdict under this article, where defendant was charged in a single count with forcibly confining five people and the court instructed the jury that the defendant could be convicted for confining "any one of the five" and did not require special verdicts by the jury, identifying each person unanimously concluded to have been forcibly confined; the possibility thus existed that not all jurors believed the defendant guilty of the same count or counts.

        Defendant who was charged with arson and who did not respond or appear for civil deposition required by his insurance company failed to assert his privilege against self-incrimination in a timely manner in response to the specific deposition questions, and he thus prevented court review of his privilege claim in the context of those questions; defendant could therefore not assert that prosecutor's comment on his failure to appear at deposition violated his privilege.

Instead, as far as the court could tell from its order, the trial court reached its conclusion that defendant made a valid waiver of his rights by assuming that defendant possessed the requisite experience, education, background, and intelligence to understand the nature of his rights and the consequences of waiving them; thus, the trial court erred by failing to make the required inquiry.

       <p>
        Vermont Constitution does not require the trial court to test voluntariness of a defendant's confession on a standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt; in judging a motion to suppress, the proper standard of proof for the court is preponderance of the evidence; Vermont's adoption of the "Massachusetts rule" under which voluntariness is first considered by the trial court and then is reconsidered by the jury adequately protects defendants' constitutional rights, as the standard of proof to be used by the jury is beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Caron, 155 Vt. 492, 586 A.2d 1127 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence on basis that his confession was involuntary under State constitutional standards; the record as a whole supported the trial court's findings that, despite some fatigue, fear, and evidence of alcohol ingestion, defendant's thought processes were not impaired, and these findings support the decision that defendant's confessions were voluntary.

       <p>
        Trial court properly denied suppression of defendant's statements in the police cruiser and processing room prior to the commencement of formal questioning. While defendant was in custody when she made the statements, and invoked her right to counsel partway through the statements, police at no point did or said anything reasonably likely to elicit incriminating statements, meaning the statements were not the product of custodial interrogation; rather, defendant's statements were not in apparent response to anything police said or did but were part of a self-reflective monologue. State v. O'Neill, 209 Vt. 599, 209 A.3d 1213 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Custodial interrogation initiated by law enforcement personnel is violative of one's privilege against self-incrimination under this article unless the prosecution clearly demonstrates that one voluntarily and intelligently waived his right and that the prosecution followed certain safeguards in questioning the accused.

       <p>
        Defendant's statements about drinking were not involuntary under the Vermont Constitution. She made the main admission she sought to suppress well after the comments to which she objected and after reaffirming her refusal to undergo field sobriety or evidentiary tests. State v. Sullivan, 194 Vt. 361, 80 A.3d 67 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress certain statements, the fact that the State had ample evidence to demonstrate that defendant possessed the requisite state of mind for the crimes charged without the statements combined with the cumulative nature of the statements led the court to conclude that any error in admitting these statements was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. There was ample evidence that defendant possessed the requisite mental state for murder, including (1) testimony from three people who interacted with defendant on the day of the shootings; (2) testimony from medical examiners and forensic investigators as to the location of the victims, the fact that multiple shots were fired, and (3) the fact that defendant shot all of his victims at close range; and the cross-examination of defendant's own psychiatric expert, who indicated his belief that defendant was capable of, and indeed did, commit the murders and attempted murders with deliberation and premeditation. State v. Williams, 188 Vt. 413, 8 A.3d 1053 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Confession to burglary and assault was not the result of police pressure where defendant arrived at police barracks uninvited and was told he was free to leave; although the officers discussed benefits to him resulting from his becoming a confidential informant, they never promised he would not be prosecuted if he admitted having committed a serious felony unrelated to the subject of their discussion, drug crime. State v. Gilman, 158 Vt. 210, 608 A.2d 660 (1992).
       </p>

        A trial court's findings in support of its decision to suppress or admit a confession must stand if they are supported by substantial evidence. State v. Gilman, 158 Vt. 210, 608 A.2d 660 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        A defendant's confession, without any evidence of police coercion, may be voluntary, even where defendant is mentally ill and incapable of validly waiving right to remain silent. State v. Robinson, 158 Vt. 286, 611 A.2d 852 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Introduction of an involuntary confession into evidence is prohibited by the United States Constitution and the Vermont Constitution; whether a confession is involuntary is determined by examining the totality of the circumstances, the ultimate question being whether police officers' threats, promises, or coercion were sufficient to overcome the defendant's free will or rational intellect, causing the defendant to confess. State v. Gilman, 158 Vt. 210, 608 A.2d 660 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to be proven voluntary and hence admissible, a confession must be the product of a rational intellect and the unfettered exercise of free will; accordingly, it may not be induced by threats, improper influence, or physical or psychological pressure. State v. Caron, 155 Vt. 492, 586 A.2d 1127 (1990).

       <p>
        Order issued against a corporation directing it to produce certain documentary evidence before grand jury, and contempt proceedings against corporation for a violation thereof, were not contrary to this article, since corporation was not a party nor charged with any crime, but simply summoned to appear before grand jury with documentary evidence, where the privilege against self-incrimination could have been claimed if desired. In re Consolidated Rendering Co., 80 Vt. 55, 66 A. 790 (1907), aff'd, 207 U.S. 541, 28 S. Ct. 178, 52 L. Ed. 327 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        When person comes before grand jury as witness in obedience to a subpoena duly served upon him and is neither under arrest for nor charged with any crime, and his testimony, given without objection on his part, is properly received and considered by grand jury, although it tends to criminate him, said grand jury may subsequently, on the strength of such testimony, legally indict him of the crime concerning which he so testified. State v. Duncan, 78 Vt. 364, 63 A. 225 (1906).

       <p>
        That respondent did not know what was going on before grand jury, and was not advised of his privilege in respect of giving criminating evidence against himself was immaterial where it was not shown that at the time he so testified it had been ascertained that a crime had been committed or that he was in custody charged with a crime, or even suspected thereof.

        Defendant was not in custody at the time of the questioning and thus was not entitled to Miranda warnings. The custody factors - particularly that a detective told defendant he was free to leave - indicated that a reasonable person in his situation would have felt at liberty to end the interview; the accusations of guilt and the detective's false statements were not enough, by themselves or under the totality of circumstances, to establish custody.

       <p>
        Under the totality of the circumstances, including defendant's prior experience with law enforcement and his assertions of innocence, detectives' psychological tactics - namely, telling defendant that he was not a malicious person and that victims of sexual assault often become abusive themselves - and their lie that a witness saw defendant accompany the victim into the woods did not overbear defendant's free will so as to render his statements involuntary. State v. Lambert, - Vt.

       <p>
        Defendant, a 15-year-old juvenile, was "in custody" while being questioned by the police at his foster home without being apprised of his Miranda rights in violation of the Fifth and Sixth Amendments and the Vermont Constitution. The officer did not expressly inform him that he was free to terminate the questioning; furthermore, the officer communicated his belief in defendant's guilt by asking him where the stolen car was, defendant's foster parent was present but discussed the importance of honesty and doing the right thing, and while the interview took place in a home setting, defendant had been there only six to eight weeks and had been recently reported as a runaway. In re E.W., 198 Vt. 311, 114 A.3d 112 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Confession obtained in violation of Miranda did not have to be excluded. The connection between defendant's first interview and the statement 20 days later in a second interview was too attenuated to find the admissions in the second interview to be the fruit of the poisonous tree. State v. Barron, 189 Vt. 193, 16 A.3d 620 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although police interviewed defendant because he alleged that his wife had committed a crime, the interview necessarily included specific questions and answers about the conduct for which defendant had been charged. It was impossible to separate the questions about defendant's conduct from those about his wife's conduct; thus, defendant was subject to custodial interrogation without warnings, in violation of Miranda. State v. Barron, 189 Vt. 193, 16 A.3d 620 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was not in custody when he voluntarily entered a detective's vehicle; thus, Miranda warnings were not required. Defendant sought the interview and agreed to the location, and the officer began the interview in earnest by stating that defendant was not under arrest, was "free to leave at any time," and did not have to talk to the officer. State v. Barron, 189 Vt. 193, 16 A.3d 620 (2011).

        Confession obtained in violation of Miranda did not have to be excluded. Defendant himself was the independent source for the evidence. State v. Barron, 189 Vt. 193, 16 A.3d 620 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Given the independent basis for the seizure and search of a drug pouch, the fact that defendant told the officer what he was about to discover without having received Miranda warnings was of no moment. State v. Delaoz, 189 Vt. 385, 22 A.3d 388 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if defendant was in custody at the time he provided consent to a search, requests for consent to search before Miranda warnings are given are permissible because such a request is not an interrogation. State v. Guzman, 184 Vt. 518, 965 A.2d 544 (2008).

       <p>
        Where defendant was in custody at the time he was questioned about possible marijuana plants, and the police did not give defendant Miranda warnings at that time, statements leading police to the marijuana plants were made in response to interrogation that violated Miranda. Since it is undisputed that the marijuana plants were fruit of the poisonous tree, the District Court erred in failing to suppress them. State v. Peterson, 181 Vt. 436, 923 A.2d 585 (April 6, 2007).

       </p>
       <p>
        Where Miranda warnings read to defendant were recited from clear and unambiguous forms and trial court properly found both that defendant suffered no serious impairment due to stress, fatigue, or intoxication at the time he waived these rights and that, based on his experience and background, he was able to comprehend the plain meaning of the warnings, trial court's finding of waiver was not clearly erroneous and was supported by substantial evidence and would stand.

        Requiring defendant, as a condition of his probation after a conviction of sexual assault, to admit his guilt as part of sex-offender therapy without providing any sort of immunity or protection from repercussions of his admission violated the defendant's Fifth Amendment and Article 10 rights against self-incrimination, because a person in a probation setting cannot be forced to incriminate himself without first receiving immunity from criminal prosecution on the basis of the admission.

        Assuming defendant's probationary status required him to answer probation officer's questions and refusal under claim of self-incrimination could be ground to revoke probation, defendant's answers did not violate his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination, since compelled statements were not to be used in criminal proceeding, but probation revocation proceeding.

        Assuming, without deciding, that it was an error for the trial court to allow the prosecution to elicit an officer's testimony during its case in chief regarding defendant's pre-arrest, pre-Miranda silence, such error was harmless. The cumulative nature of the offending testimony and the fact that defendant was the only potential perpetrator convinced the court that the outcome of the trial would not have been different had the officer's testimony been excluded. State v. Kulzer, 186 Vt. 264, 979 A.2d 1031 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no constitutional error in allowing the State to play a videotape of defendant in a holding cell during which defendant purportedly invoked his right to silence. The whole point of showing the tape, which was admitted to show defendant's intoxication, was to show defendant's behavior; there was no focus at all on the content of what defendant said or did not say. State v. Lee, 185 Vt. 110, 967 A.2d 1161 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although defendant argued that by asking defendant's wife if she had evidence to dispute the allegations against her husband, the State commented on his silence, in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Chapter I, Article 10 of the Vermont Constitution and 13 V.S.A.
        §
        6601 and that the court's curative instruction was insufficient to remedy the harm caused, and that his convictions must therefore be reversed, the court promptly instructed the jury that the State bore the burden of proof, and that defendant had no obligation to present any evidence to disprove the allegations; whether or not the question asked of defendant's wife was improper, the court's instructions were sufficient to correct any possible prejudice.

        Where there was no violation of the Vermont protection against self-incrimination in telling a jury that it could consider a defendant's silence, there could not be a violation of the same clause when the trial court explicitly warned the jury that it was not to consider defendant's silence against him.

       <p>
        Use of preponderance of evidence as standard of proof in home-health nurse's license suspension decision was appropriate and did not offend due process; license suspension hearing did not approximate a criminal action for purpose of establishing burden of proof, and statutory procedures, together with preponderance of evidence burden placed on State, afforded constitutional process due to nurse. In re Smith, 169 Vt. 162, 730 A.2d 605 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        The test to determine whether a particular standard of proof satisfies due process under Vt. Const. Ch. I, Art. 10 and U.S. Const. Amend. XIV requires a balancing of the competing interests: (1) the private interest affected by the State action, (2) the risk of erroneously infringing on this interest under the applicable standard, (3) the governmental interest in the procedure, and (4) the burden on the government of imposing a higher standard. Relation v. Vermont Parole Board, 163 Vt. 534, 660 A.2d 318 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The first factor to consider in determining the constitutionality of the standard of proof required to establish a parole violation is the parolee's interest in continued conditional liberty, which is at least as great as the interest of the prisoner in accurate fact-finding in a prison disciplinary proceeding and entails many of the core values of unqualified liberty, including, subject to conditions, the freedom to seek gainful employment and to be with family and friends. Relation v. Vermont Parole Board, 163 Vt. 534, 660 A.2d 318 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Applying any standard that calls for less than a preponderance of the evidence at the fact-finding stage of a parole-revocation proceeding invites error, allowing the Parole Board to revoke parole even where the evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that there has been no violation of conditions. Relation v. Vermont Parole Board, 163 Vt. 534, 660 A.2d 318 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        At the fact-finding stage of a parole revocation proceeding, the government has an undeniably strong interest in being able to return the individual to imprisonment without the burden of a new adversary criminal trial but only if in fact he has failed to abide by the conditions of his parole; the government has no interest in revoking parole where the weight of evidence indicates there has been no parole violation. Relation v. Vermont Parole Board, 163 Vt. 534, 660 A.2d 318 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Imposing a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard to establish a parole revocation will present little if any administrative burden on the government as the parolee is entitled to an opportunity to be heard and to present witnesses, and has the right to confront and cross-examine witnesses, unless good cause is shown to deny confrontation and it will require little if any change in the current procedure to require that the findings be based on a preponderance of the evidence rather than simply on substantial evidence. Relation v. Vermont Parole Board, 163 Vt. 534, 660 A.2d 318 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Imposing the preponderance-of-the-evidence standard on the State in the fact-finding stage of a parole revocation proceeding will greatly reduce the risk of erroneous parole violations while imposing minimal burden on the government.

        The substantial evidence standard in 28 V.S.A.
        §
        552(b)(2) violates the due process rights protected by Article 10, Chapter I of the State Constitution and thus proof of a parole violation must be established by a preponderance of the evidence. Relation v. Vermont Parole Board, 163 Vt. 534, 660 A.2d 318 (1995).

        Exclusion of defendant's wife and a neighbor from the courtroom gallery while ten-year-old victim of lewd and lascivious conduct testified, on the ground that their presence would distress the victim and adversely affect her ability to testify, did not deny defendant the right to a public trial; court properly exercised its discretion under V.R.E. 611(a)(3) to protect the witness, and did not bar the public from attending the trial.

       <p>
        In expressing its unwillingness to continue the case when there was a risk that an ill witness could be readmitted to the hospital shortly before a rescheduled trial, the trial court prioritized speed over defendant's right to present a defense. This insistence on speed, in the face of a justifiable request for continuance, violated both the Sixth Amendment and the Vermont Constitution. State v. Heffernan, 206 Vt. 261, 180 A.3d 579 (2017).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Insofar as Article 11 of the Vermont Constitution unequivocally sets forth a single specific right of the people to be free from unwarranted searches and seizures of their persons, possessions, and property, that provision is manifestly self-executing. The extensive case law on Article 11 demonstrates that the right set forth therein is certain and definite enough to establish rules for the implementation of that right; moreover, because the right set forth in Article 11 is sufficiently specified, the absence of a legislative directive supports a conclusion that the provision is self-executing. Zullo v. State, 209 Vt. 298, 205 A.3d 466 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Border search by federal officers, conducted in compliance with the Fourth Amendment as acknowledged by defendant, could not be challenged under the Vermont Constitution. State v. Rennis, 195 Vt. 492, 90 A.3d 906 (2014).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Overriding function of the search and seizure provision of the Vermont Constitution is to protect personal privacy and dignity against unwarranted intrusion by the State; it requires that the State temper its efforts to apprehend criminals with a concern for the impact of its methods on fundamental liberties. Principles established in cases delineate the extent to which official intrusion into the privacy of any citizen will be constitutionally permissible. State v. Bryant, 183 Vt. 355, 950 A.2d 467 (Mar. 28, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Task of Supreme Court is to honor not merely words but underlying purposes of constitutional guarantees, and to discover and protect core value that gave life to this article. State v. Savva, 159 Vt. 75, 616 A.2d 774 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Preference for judicially issued search warrants reflects basic constitutional doctrine that individual freedoms will best be preserved through separation of powers and division of functions among different branches and levels of government. State v. Savva, 159 Vt. 75, 616 A.2d 774 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        The primary evil sought to be avoided by this article was the issuance of general warrants. State v. Record, 150 Vt. 84, 548 A.2d 422 (1988).

       <p>
        There was no error in the trial court's general description of an attached structure on defendant's property as a carport rather than as a garage, as neither were terms of art, neither had a technical or specialized meaning with respect to constitutional search and seizure, and the description of the structure did not affect application of constitutional principles. State v. Koenig, 202 Vt. 243, 148 A.3d 977 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        The warrant requirement of this article serves as a check on the executive power by guaranteeing review by a neutral and detached magistrate before a search is carried out, thereby deterring searches on doubtful grounds and assuring the people of an impartial objective assessment prior to a governmental invasion. State v. Bauder, 181 Vt. 392, 924 A.2d 38 (March 16, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the core value of the privacy right protected by both the Vermont and U.S. Constitution is the right to be free from unreasonable government intrusions into legitimate expectations of privacy, Vermont jurisprudence has diverged from the United States Supreme Court's analysis. State v. Welch, 160 Vt. 70, 624 A.2d 1105 (1992); State v. Richardson, 158 Vt. 635, 603 A.2d 378 (mem.) (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Requirement of warrant prior to search and seizure favors decision making by Judicial Branch, a neutral and detached magistrate, rather than by Executive Branch, the officer engaged in the often competitive enterprise of ferreting out crime. State v. Savva, 159 Vt. 75, 616 A.2d 774 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        This article protects two kinds of rights: possessory rights, which are implicated in police seizures, and privacy rights, which are implicated in searches. State v. Savva, 159 Vt. 75, 616 A.2d 774 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        This article's prohibition against unlawful searches and seizures protects people, not places. State v. Zaccaro, 154 Vt. 83, 574 A.2d 1256 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The word "unreasonable," in the context in which it appears in the Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution, is implicit in this article in the same context. State v. Record, 150 Vt. 84, 548 A.2d 422 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        By delineating the right protected by this article as a possessory interest, this article premises the protected right upon an objectively defined relationship between a person and the item seized or place searched, as opposed to a subjective evaluation of the legitimacy of the person's expectation of privacy in the area searched. State v. Wood, 148 Vt. 479, 536 A.2d 902 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right of the people "to hold themselves, their houses, papers, and possessions free from search or seizure" defines a right dependent on a possessory interest, with equal recognition accorded to the item seized and the area intruded upon. State v. Wood, 148 Vt. 479, 536 A.2d 902 (1987).

        Probable cause to issue search warrant was supported by substantial evidence based on totality of circumstances, where packages which contained marijuana came from a false address and false sender, sender misstated contents, defendant's mailbox was marked for delivery only on day of delivery, person to whom packages were addressed was not at delivery address, and defendant appeared "very nervous" while accepting packages. State v. Defranceaux, 170 Vt. 561, 743 A.2d 1074 (mem.) (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Search warrant was not invalidated by officer's failure to include, in application for warrant, information concerning unsuccessful initial search conducted near defendant's residence pursuant to an informant's tip; informant's factual assertions were substantiated by officer upon returning to area with informant, and officer's subsequent first-hand knowledge of marijuana growing in defendant's yard was sufficient by itself to establish probable cause to issue warrant. State v. Hall, 168 Vt. 327, 719 A.2d 435 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was sufficient probable cause to believe that evidence of crime would be found within defendant's home; fact that marijuana plant in defendant's back yard appeared cultivated, as opposed to untended, supported inference that materials for manufacture and cultivation of marijuana existed at the residence, and informant had also provided information about drug paraphernalia located inside defendant's house. State v. Hall, 168 Vt. 327, 719 A.2d 435 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Acknowledgments that merely create a suspicion of an informant's involvement in criminal activity, such as that the informant was present during a drug transaction or had smoked marijuana before, will not suffice as admissions against penal interest, such as to support the issuance of a search warrant. State v. Morris, 165 Vt. 111, 680 A.2d 90 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where application for search warrant was closely preceded by supervised entry of defendant's home by government informant who had previously executed controlled buy in the same premises, credibility of informant was buttressed by proof that information he supplied was reliable, and judicial officer could independently conclude there was adequate basis for warrant. State v. Emmi, 160 Vt. 377, 628 A.2d 939 (1993).

        Warrant authorizing officers to search for and remove any animals at defendant's home was not unconstitutionally broad, as the exceptionally neglected condition of a dog seen on defendant's porch reasonably supported a probable cause finding to support a search for and seizure of not only that dog, but others reasonably believed to be at the home.

        Distinctive characteristics of the dollar bill pouch dropped by defendant, combined with the officer's testimony that, based on his training and experience, such a container was commonly used to carry drugs, provided the officer with probable cause to believe a crime was afoot and to seize the pouch. Furthermore, the seizure of the pouch met the exigent circumstances exception to the warrant requirement because if the officer had attempted to secure a warrant, there was a substantial likelihood that the evidence would have disappeared. State v. Delaoz, 189 Vt. 385, 22 A.3d 388 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Dollar bill pouch dropped by defendant was folded in such a distinctive way that it essentially proclaimed its contents unambiguously to an officer, justifying not only its seizure, but the officer's subsequent inspection of its contents. State v. Delaoz, 189 Vt. 385, 22 A.3d 388 (2010).

        Fundamental principles of Vermont's search and seizure jurisprudence seek to balance the legitimate goals of law enforcement with the right of citizens to be protected from government intrusion. Where incriminating evidence is literally dropped in front of a police officer who is lawfully carrying out his duties and where the incriminating nature of the evidence is immediately apparent, there is no intrusion into a constitutionally protected area that would preclude seizure of that evidence under the Vermont Constitution or the Fourth Amendment. State v. Delaoz, 189 Vt. 385, 22 A.3d 388 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Probable cause exists where the facts and circumstances within the arresting officer's knowledge are sufficient in themselves to warrant a person of reasonable caution to believe that a crime is being committed. Because the pat-down of defendant did not extend beyond a reasonable search incident to arrest, the additional evidence found on defendant's person - cocaine and marijuana - was properly seized and introduced into evidence. State v. Delaoz, 189 Vt. 385, 22 A.3d 388 (2010).

        Searches outside the normal judicial process are presumptively unconstitutional, and permissible only pursuant to a few narrowly drawn and well-delineated exceptions. Such rare exceptions are allowed only in those extraordinary circumstances which make the warrant and probable-cause requirement impracticable. State v.

        No amount of probable cause can justify a warrantless search or seizure absent exigent circumstances. This principle applies with equal or greater force where the probable cause is merely presumed from the fact of an arrest. State v. Bauder, 181 Vt. 392, 924 A.2d 38 (March 16, 2007).

        Where a uniformed officer pulled his marked police cruiser into a parking lot and parked nose-to-nose with a couple's car, leaving the engine running and the lights on, essentially blocking the exit to the lot, the encounter rose to the level of an investigatory stop, and there was a seizure that was not justified by suspicion of criminal wrongdoing or community caretaking.

        Seizure occurred when officer pulled his cruiser into breakdown lane behind defendant's vehicle, activated cruiser's blue lights and spotlight, and requested defendant's license and registration, since a reasonable person in defendant's position would objectively believe he was not free to leave following this show of authority.

        What society is prepared to recognize as a "reasonable expectation of privacy" should not, under State and U.S. Constitutions, be the measure of individual rights; role of Vermont Supreme Court is to protect constitutionally guaranteed privacy, not to acquiesce in its erosion if and as people's expectations ebb.

        When police improperly expanded the scope of a valid traffic stop into a drug investigation, the unlawful detention invalidated defendant's consent, as his consent arose directly from his illegal detention, with no intervening time and no intervening events.

        State had not shown that defendant's girlfriend gave implied consent for the investigating officer to enter the couple's residence, as the girlfriend's actions of opening the front door, motioning toward defendant, saying, "He's right here," and walking into the kitchen were not sufficient to convey consent, and there was no evidence that the officer believed that the girlfriend's actions provided consent.

        Defendant's consent to being transported to the police barracks for a full-body strip search was not voluntary. First, defendant agreed to a search only after a trooper explicitly told him that both he and his companion would be "seized" and taken to the police barracks to await a warrant; second, the trooper lacked the authority to transport defendant to the barracks against his will because neither the informant's tip nor the trooper's lengthy surveillance or later interaction with defendant provided probable cause.

        There was no basis to disturb the trial court's finding that defendant's consent to the search of her house was voluntary. There was no evidence that the police coerced her consent to search through the use of physical force, threats, or intimidation; defendant's concern that withholding consent might inconvenience her son did not amount to the sort of psychological pressure that courts view as impermissibly coercive; and an officer did not communicate that a warrant would automatically issue regardless of defendant's decision or that her refusal would be a futile gesture, but indicated truthfully and accurately that a refusal would result in an application for a search warrant involving the submission of an affidavit.

       <p>
        Numerous courts have upheld consensual searches where an officer's statement that he would get or obtain a warrant is supported by probable cause.

       <p>
        There were no grounds to require a pre-entry warning when the officers' stated intentions in asking to come inside defendant's house and talk to her were to confirm her brother's identity and continue their investigation into drug dealing. Defendant did not claim, nor did the record show, that the police sought entry for the purpose of conducting a warrantless search; indeed, the undisputed evidence revealed that the search request occurred only after the officers entered and observed marijuana in plain view.

        Totality of the evidence supported the conclusion that defendant's consent to the search of his car was voluntary.

        The plain-view doctrine is predicated on two principles: first, that when an officer has observed an object in plain view from a legal vantage point the owner's privacy interests are forfeited; and second, that requiring a warrant once the police have obtained a first-hand perception of the object would be a needless inconvenience. Thus, decisions have come to reflect the rule that if, while lawfully engaged in an activity in a particular place, police officers perceive a suspicious object, they may seize it immediately. To modify the doctrine by allowing the seizure of objects which the officers did not observe would eviscerate its fundamental evidentiary and legal grounding. State v.

        Because the vehicle belonging to defendant, who was charged with driving under the influence (DUI) and the possession of marijuana, was located in a public parking lot, the arresting officer was lawfully present when he shined his flashlight into the car and observed the open container of alcohol, thus satisfying the first prong of the plain-view exception to warrant requirement, that the officer has not violated the Fourth Amendment in arriving at the place from which the evidence can be plainly viewed; and because the arresting officer had probable cause to associate with the crime of DUI a partially full beer can in a vehicle driven by a person who had failed a field sobriety test, the second prong of the plain-view exception, requiring probable cause to associate the evidence that is in plain view with criminal activity, was also satisfied.

        Officer had reasonable suspicion under the Fourth Amendment and the Vermont Constitution to expand the scope of his suspended-license investigation into a drug investigation, permitting him to ask defendant to exit his vehicle and to interview defendant about a prescription bottle. Defendant was sitting in his car in an area of a parking lot known for drug activity; defendant made furtive movements as if shuffling an object in the front seat of the car when he saw the officer approaching; the object defendant appeared to hide from the officer was a prescription pill bottle with a worn label; defendant was nervous and shaking when asked for his identification; and defendant's wallet contained a large amount of crumpled bills.

        Officer did not have reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, as he had not gleaned any information on his previous approach of defendant to indicate that defendant had any contraband, defendant's stale arrest record nearly a decade earlier did not provide the officer with reasonable suspicion, and defendant's comments that he had been coming from Massachusetts hardly supported a suspicion of drug possession. State v. Winters, 200 Vt. 296, 131 A.3d 186 (Sept. 4, 2015).

       <p>
        Exit request is constitutionally permissible when it is supported by objective facts that support a reasonable suspicion that the safety of investigating officers or members of the public is at risk or that a crime has been committed; several states have held that the smell of burning marijuana gives investigating officers at least such a reasonable suspicion. Therefore, when an officer found a car matching one described by an informant, smelled marijuana coming from the car, and followed snow tracks from the car into an apartment, his request that defendant and others who had been in the car accompany him outside did not constitute an unconstitutional seizure. State v. Ford, 182 Vt. 421, 940 A.2d 687 (Sept. 28, 2007).

        It was reasonable for a trooper to require defendant to leave her vehicle to conduct further investigation where, prior to the order, he observed her cross the centerline in the face of oncoming traffic, smelled an odor of intoxicants coming from the car, observed that defendant's speech was slightly slurred, and noted that her eyes were watery and bloodshot and did not appear to focus.

        Even though a police officer did not personally observe any incriminating behavior by the driver, he could reasonably detain a vehicle where he was acting upon an anonymous tip that accurately described the vehicle, accurately predicted its route and location upon the highway, and indicated that it was behaving in a fashion indicative of drunk driving. State v. Boyea, 171 Vt. 401, 765 A.2d 862 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Police officer was justified in stopping defendant's car after being told by another motorist "there's something wrong with that man"; although officer had no reasonable and articulable suspicion that defendant was committing crime, because she did not see him engage in any unusual behavior or violate any motor vehicle law, investigatory stop of defendant's vehicle was a reasonable police response under the circumstances, because police have an essential role as public servants to assist those in distress and to maintain and foster public safety. State v. Marcello, 157 Vt. 657, 599 A.2d 357 (mem.) (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Investigatory stops are permitted where specific and articulable facts, together with the rational inference taken therefrom, reasonably warrant the intrusion, and the requisite level of suspicion is considerably less than proof of wrongdoing by a preponderance of the evidence. State v. Siergiey, 155 Vt. 78, 582 A.2d 119 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        For purposes of reasonable suspicion adequate to justify an investigatory stop, generally information about criminal or suspicious activity from a citizen who is not a paid informant and is unconnected with the police is presumed to be reliable. State v. Siergiey, 155 Vt. 78, 582 A.2d 119 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Officer's investigatory stop of driver based on citizen's complaint of erratic driving and officer's observation of extremely slow driving by defendant was sufficiently based on reasonable suspicion to warrant stop. State v. Siergiey, 155 Vt. 78, 582 A.2d 119 (1990).

        As a general rule, a motor vehicle roadblock sobriety checkpoint will pass constitutional muster if: (1) the initial stop and contact between the officers in the field and the motorist involves an explanation of the nature of the roadblock and minimal detention of a nonimpaired driver; (2) the discretion of the officers in the field, as to the method to be utilized in the selecting vehicles to be stopped, is carefully circumscribed by clear objective guidelines established by a high level administrative official; (3) the guidelines are followed in the operation of the roadblock; (4) approaching drivers are given adequate warning that there is a roadblock ahead; (5) the likelihood of apprehension, fear, or surprise is dispelled by a visible display of legitimate police authority at the roadblock; and (6) vehicles are stopped on a systematic, nonrandom basis that shows drivers they are not being singled out for arbitrary reasons.

        There was no constitutional violation by a trooper's entry into an attached structure that was described as a "carport" because there was a reasonable, objective basis for the trooper's belief that the entryway to the left was a business entrance, and that the remaining visible entryway, which was visible from the street, was a normal point of public access to the residence.

        Trial court properly concluded that warrantless air search of defendant's property did not violate Vermont or U.S. Constitution, where area searched was an open field not within curtilage of defendant's home, and where there was no evidence that airplane flew in airspace constitutionally protected.

        Protections of the Vermont Constitution for hunting, trapping, and fishing, and the associated implementing statutes, do not diminish a landowner's expectation of privacy against warrantless intrusion and do not require a reframing or exception to the framework established in Kirchoff, in which the Court held that Article 11 protected against warrantless searches of "open fields" when the landowner objectively demonstrated his or her intent for privacy. State v. Dupuis, 208 Vt. 196, 197 A.3d 343 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        By posting approximately thirty signs roughly 100 feet apart around the perimeter of his property, and by placing a gate with "no trespassing" signs at the entrance to the main thoroughfare onto his property, defendant objectively signaled to the outside world that strangers were not welcome, and thus had an expectation of privacy under Kirchoff even though he had not strictly abided by Vermont's regulations for posting against hunting. State v. Dupuis, 208 Vt. 196, 197 A.3d 343 (2018).

        Mandatory testing and disclosure of HIV status threaten privacy interests beyond the taking of a blood sample, particularly because of the social stigma, harassment, and discrimination often suffered by individuals who have AIDS or who are HIV-positive.

       </p>
       <p>
        While a person may have a reasonable expectation that face-to-face conversations with another person in his or her own home are not being broadcast outside the home, the Court does not believe that a person who broadcasts his or her own conversation to those outside the home without knowledge of the circumstances at the other end of the conversation has an expectation of privacy in that conversation that society would deem reasonable. Thus, the trial court properly allowed a detective to testify about a telephone conversation between defendant and an informant to which he listened. State v. Wetter, 190 Vt. 476, 35 A.3d 962 (2011).
       </p>

        Vermont's Constitution affords no privacy protection in an Internet service provider's subscriber address or use information disclosing noncontent data. State v. Simmons, 190 Vt. 141, 27 A.3d 1065 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Given the necessary and willing exposure of an Internet user's access point identification and frequency of use to third party Internet service providers, such information cannot reasonably be considered confidential for purposes of the Vermont Constitution, especially when a provider openly declares a policy of disclosure; the information appears no more private than a phone number and the number of calls made, or a street address or post office box and volume of mail, neither of which could plausibly be considered private. Accordingly, subpoenaing information about the address defendant used to access a social networking site and the frequency of his use did not violate the Vermont Constitution. State v. Simmons, 190 Vt. 141, 27 A.3d 1065 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Regardless of the openness of the drug transaction between defendant and an informant, the transaction was obviously not open to the general public, and the object of the transaction was contained in a closed backpack. Thus, the trial court correctly ruled that defendant's actions manifested an actual expectation of privacy. State v. Birchard, 188 Vt. 172, 5 A.3d 879 (2010).

        Vermont citizens have a constitutional right to privacy that ascends into the airspace above their homes and property. State v. Bryant, 183 Vt. 355, 950 A.2d 467 (Mar. 28, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Scope of the Vermont Constitution's protection does not turn on whether the activity disclosed by a search is illegal or innocuous; the interest protected by the Vermont Constitution, like the Fourth Amendment, is the expectation of the ordinary citizen, who has never engaged in illegal conduct in his life. The scope of constitutional protection must reflect the impact of a practice on the sense of security that is the true concern of the Constitution's protection of privacy. State v. Bryant, 183 Vt. 355, 950 A.2d 467 (Mar. 28, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Legality of the altitude at which aerial surveillance takes place can be relevant to the determination of whether an individual has a legitimate expectation of privacy in his real property; indeed, the citizens of Vermont likely expect that law enforcement personnel as well as other air travelers will abide by safety rules and other applicable laws and regulations when flying over their homes. However, it simply does not follow that whether a member of the public is abiding by the law in occupying a particular spot in the public airspace is an adequate test of whether government surveillance from that same spot is constitutional; therefore, the Supreme Court of Vermont disagrees with those courts that would use the legality of an aircraft's position alone to evaluate the constitutionality of the surveillance conducted aboard it. State v. Bryant, 183 Vt. 355, 950 A.2d 467 (Mar. 28, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Warrantless aerial surveillance was a patent violation of defendant's legitimate expectations of privacy when defendant had demonstrated that he had a subjective expectation of privacy in his back yard by taking precautions to exclude others from his back yard by posting his land and by communicating to a local forest official that he did not want people trespassing on his land; it was of no moment that defendant could not effectively post his sky. Furthermore, defendant's subjective expectation that he would be free from this intrusion - an aerial surveillance that targeted defendant's home and curtilage, was highly intrusive, and was in violation of laws governing helicopter flight - was legitimate. State v. Bryant, 183 Vt. 355, 950 A.2d 467 (Mar. 28, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        With technological advances in surveillance techniques, the privacy-protection question is no longer whether police have physically invaded a constitutionally protected area; rather, the inquiry is whether the surveillance invaded a constitutionally protected legitimate expectation of privacy. A targeted, low-level helicopter surveillance by the police of activities in an enclosed backyard is not consistent with that expectation - not without a warrant. State v. Bryant, 183 Vt. 355, 950 A.2d 467 (Mar. 28, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Nothing about the fact that the search occurs in a vehicle would justify a reduced probable-cause standard. Indeed, while it has been acknowledged that vehicles support a somewhat diminished expectation of privacy, this is not to say that they carry no expectation of privacy, or that an arrest of the driver obviates the need to establish specific probable cause to search. State v. Bauder, 181 Vt. 392, 924 A.2d 38 (March 16, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the Vermont Constitution, the question of whether an individual has a legitimate expectation of privacy hinges on the essence of underlying constitutional values - including respect for both private, subjective expectations and public norms.
    Accordingly, the provision requires first that a person has exhibited an actual (subjective) expectation of privacy and, second, that the expectation be one that society is prepared to recognize as reasonable. State v. Rheaume, 179 Vt. 39, 889 A.2d 711 (August 26, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        While it is true that the public at large may not freely access the emergency area of a hospital, medical personnel, hospital staff, patients and their families, and emergency workers - including police officers - are, as a matter of course, frequently, and not unexpectedly, moving through the area.
    Against this background, a patient undergoing treatment for only a brief period of time cannot reasonably expect either to restrict access to the area, or to control whether other patients, their families, or the other categories of personnel are present in the area. State v. Rheaume, 179 Vt. 39, 889 A.2d 711 (August 26, 2005).

        Where police detectives, investigating an allegation that defendant had engaged in sexual acts with a child, were invited by defendant into his residence and secretly tape recorded an interview with defendant, because the officers did not establish a reasonable justification for the recording before a neutral magistrate, the tape was properly suppressed. State v. Geraw, 173 Vt. 350, 795 A.2d 1219 (2002).
       </p>

       </p>
       <p>
        Warrantless video surveillance that recorded defendant tending marijuana plants about 150 feet from his home was not unconstitutional, and videotape was not required to be suppressed; defendant had no reasonable expectation of privacy in area of marijuana garden because he took no steps to exclude the public, and video camera recorded only what an officer standing in the same position would have observed with the naked eye. State v. Costin, 168 Vt. 175, 720 A.2d 866 (1998).

        Seizure of a bag of marijuana found in defendant's vehicle when defendant was pulled over for driving under the influence, which was lawful under the plain-view exception to the warrant requirement since the officer viewed the partially exposed baggie while lawfully reaching inside the vehicle to seize an open beer can and had probable cause to believe the baggie contained contraband, infringed on no privacy or possessory interests.

       </p>
       <p>
        The Vermont Constitution protects persons from warrantless police searches into the contents of secured opaque trash bags left at curbside for garbage collection and disposal. Because persons have an objectively reasonable privacy interest in the contents of such containers, police must obtain a warrant before searching through them. State v. Morris, 165 Vt. 111, 680 A.2d 90 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether persons have a privacy interest in any given area or activity, such as to be constitutionally protected against unreasonable searches and seizures, both private subjective expectations and general social norms must be examined. State v. Morris, 165 Vt. 111, 680 A.2d 90 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        The privacy interest in one's trash is not equivalent to the privacy interest in one's home; accordingly, the seizure of trash bags is permitted without a warrant given the exigency of the situation.
    Once the police have seized the bags, however, they cannot search them before obtaining a warrant based on probable cause. State v. Morris, 165 Vt. 111, 680 A.2d 90 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since paramount concern in search and seizure cases is to give effect to core values of privacy underlying provision of Vermont Constitution, Vermont Supreme Court does not hesitate to depart from parallel federal law when necessary to accomplish this goal.

        Shield created by vegetation or topographical barriers fails to demonstrate landowner's intent to exclude public since not clearing land does not constitute affirmative action demonstrating concern for privacy. State v. Rogers, 161 Vt. 236, 638 A.2d 569 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since Vermont Constitution does not protect areas willingly exposed to the public, where defendants took no steps to prevent public from reaching place of observation or to prevent observation, they knowingly exposed garden to public. State v. Rogers, 161 Vt. 236, 638 A.2d 569 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendants exhibited no expectation of privacy where they did nothing to exclude persons from walking through woods on their land, allowed existence of path at point of entry to serve as invitation for such a walk, distance was short, and presence of cameras, spotlights, and sheep fencing around garden showed that defendants expected garden to be observed but wanted to prevent theft.

        Although a person's home is a place where one can generally expect privacy, determination of need for warrant prior to search involves an objective inquiry: whether a reasonable person should know that the occupant has sought to exclude the public.

       </p>
       <p>
        In view of disarray of premises and numerous unanswered phone calls concerning overdue rent, it was reasonable for investigating officer to conclude that lessee of property no longer sought to exclude public; police therefore did not violate defendant's federal or State constitutional rights when entering house without a warrant, and trial court did not err in refusing to suppress fruits of subsequent search.

       <p>
        Defendant, charged with concealing material facts in obtaining prescriptions for regulated drugs, had standing under Vermont Constitution to raise claim that right to privacy was violated by a warrantless inspection of her prescription records; privacy interest arose from expectation that such records cannot be arbitrarily disclosed.

       </p>
       <p>
        In deciding whether a defendant has standing to assert a privacy claim under the Vermont Constitution, the Supreme Court looks at the objective relationship of the person to the place searched or items seized, as opposed to a subjective evaluation of the legitimacy of the person's expectation of privacy; a defendant need only assert a possessory, proprietary, or participatory interest in the item seized or the area searched to establish standing to assert a challenge.

        Defendant had legitimate expectation of privacy in contents of brown paper bag in which marijuana, contained in plastic bags, was found; functionally, paper bag was a closed container that effectively concealed its contents from public eye, plastic bags were also opaque and concealed their contents, and packaging was not so distinctive as to give away the contents.

       <p>
        Removal of pubic hair, involving area traditionally concealed from public view, implicates this article, which protects people of State from unreasonable, warrantless governmental intrusion into affairs they choose to keep private; thus, in absence of valid exception, seizure of pubic hairs requires warrant issued under probable cause. State v. Towne, 158 Vt. 607, 615 A.2d 484 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Affidavits provided probable cause to support nontestimonial identification order in murder case, where crime, probably including rape, was committed, probable cause existed to believe defendant committed it, and unidentified hairs were found on victim's clothes; where probable cause existed, sample of defendant's pubic hair could be ordered removed.

         18. Exigent circumstances.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Because defendant consented to the search of her car, the State was not required to show exigent circumstances or to obtain a warrant. Therefore, the court rejected defendant's argument that the search of her purse, which was inside the car, violated the Vermont Constitution because no exigent circumstances existed. State v. Lamonda, 190 Vt. 618, 30 A.3d 687 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's threats of violence and means to carry them out presented sufficiently exigent circumstances to justify warrantless police entry of home during domestic disturbance involving defendant's girlfriend and their infant daughter; there was therefore no violation of defendant's federal or State constitutional rights, and trial court did not err in refusing to suppress evidence or in denying defendant's motion for acquittal of assault charges stemming from his altercation with officers. State v. Petruccelli, 170 Vt. 51, 743 A.2d 1062 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the vehicle of defendant, who was charged with driving under the influence and possession of marijuana, would have remained in the public parking lot where defendant was arrested and would have been accessible to the two other occupants of the vehicle who were not arrested, the State proved exigent circumstances existed, since the evidence, which was an open container of alcohol discovered by the arresting officer, could have been removed before a warrant was obtained; therefore, the third prong of the plain-view exception to the warrant requirement, which requires exigent circumstances to give an officer lawful access to the evidence, was satisfied. State v. Trudeau, 165 Vt. 355, 683 A.2d 725 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        A container that can be seized, removed from a vehicle, and secured by the police does not ordinarily present a reasonable exigent circumstance to dispense with a warrant to search the container. State v. Savva, 159 Vt. 75, 616 A.2d 774 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        An otherwise unreasonable warrantless search may be justified by exigent circumstances. State v. Savva, 159 Vt. 75, 616 A.2d 774 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any exceptions to search warrant requirement must be factually and narrowly tied to exigent circumstances and reasonable expectations of privacy, and bright-line tests are rejected because they fail to do justice to values underlying this article.

       </p>

         19. Condition of probation.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Warrantless-search probation condition violated Article 11 of the Vermont Constitution in that none of the specific items named were contraband, leaving only a residual condition that would not provide guidance as to when defendant could be searched without a warrant. State v. Bouchard, 211 Vt. 454, 228 A.3d 349 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because a probation condition imposed upon defendant, a sex offender, on its face authorized limitless monitoring of his computer and Internet use, it was not narrowly tailored to ensure a permissible balance between the government's interests and defendant's privacy rights, and was not reasonably necessary to help defendant lead a law-abiding life. State v. Bouchard, 211 Vt. 454, 228 A.3d 349 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Home visit by a probation officer is not a search, and a home-visit requirement does not run afoul of the Vermont or U.S. Constitution's search and seizure provisions. A home-visit condition such as the one here, which required defendant to allow his probation officer to visit him wherever he was staying, was a legitimate tool of probation administration and was valid. State v. Levitt, 202 Vt. 193, 148 A.3d 204 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        While a probation condition was narrowly tailored in that it authorized a search only for contraband, it required amendment in that neither a computer nor digital media could be considered contraband here, redrafting was required to eliminate the specification that the State's search powers were based on some kind of waiver by defendant, and the condition should state explicitly that the State's search rights were dependent on its having reasonable suspicion that evidence of a probation violation would be found. State v. Cornell, 202 Vt. 19, 146 A.3d 895 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Probation condition providing for warrantless searches does not violate Article 11 of Vermont Constitution, if terms of probation are narrowly tailored to fit circumstances of individual probationer; and if officers have reasonable grounds to conduct search.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Defendant's arrest violated the Fourth Amendment and Vt. Const. Ch. I, Art. 11 because there was no probable cause to arrest him for negligent operation of a motor vehicle. His driving over a washed-out part of a driveway was not negligent, given that unpaved roads were commonplace in Vermont, and his speed of 25 mph did not change this conclusion since there was no evidence that his speed was excessive under the circumstances or unnecessary to traverse the washout as he did. State v. Hawkins, 193 Vt. 297, 67 A.3d 230 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Several considerations supported the trial court's determination that an informant's information, which led to defendant's warrantless arrest, was reliable on this occasion: first, there was strong evidence that the informant was involved in selling drugs at the retail level in Rutland; second, the informant described defendant's vehicle, predicted the time and route of his arrival into Rutland, and personally identified him on three occasions; third, the identity of the confidential informant was known to the police, as well as to defendant and the trial court, and she gave a statement under oath describing her past involvement with defendant; fourth, the informant provided information that implicated her in commission of a crime. The fact that the informant made a self-serving declaration to try to prevent liability for an additional crime did not undercut the reliability assessment, nor did the informant's motive in assisting the police. State v. Arrington, 188 Vt. 460, 8 A.3d 483 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Odor of marijuana, detected by a trained and experienced police officer, can provide a reasonable basis to believe that marijuana is present. The odor alone may not always be sufficient to arrest an individual. State v. Guzman, 184 Vt. 518, 965 A.2d 544 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a trained and experienced police officer identifies the unmistakable odor of a controlled substance and can link it to a specific person, there is probable cause to arrest. State v. Guzman, 184 Vt. 518, 965 A.2d 544 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because police had probable cause to arrest defendant, the search of defendant's person was permissible as incident to that arrest; it was of no significance that police did not formally arrest defendant before conducting the search of his person. Probable cause to arrest existed before the search, and the formal arrest came shortly thereafter. State v. Guzman, 184 Vt. 518, 965 A.2d 544 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Odor of a controlled substance may provide probable cause to arrest when the odor is unmistakable and may be linked to a specific person or persons because of the particular circumstances in which it is discovered or because other evidence at the scene or elsewhere links the odor to the person or persons.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Even assuming the warrant application provided probable cause to search, the illegal seizure of defendant's vehicle was so closely related to the subsequent application for the warrant and search of defendant's vehicle as to require exclusion of the evidence obtained. If the vehicle had not been seized, defendant would have been able to drive it away before a warrant was obtained and the search occurred. State v. Clinton-Aimable, 212 Vt. 107, 232 A.3d 1092 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence found outside a police cruiser after defendant was taken to the police barracks for a strip search, and his subsequent confession, should have been suppressed. Defendant's presence at the barracks resulted directly from his invalidly obtained consent to the search, and his confession to possessing drugs flowed directly from the discovery of the illegally obtained evidence. State v. Betts, 194 Vt. 212, 75 A.3d 629 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        When officers' interest in the house of defendant's sister flowed from a taxi dispatcher's initial identification of the house as the address where a taxi was regularly sent from a suspected drug-dealing operation, they had ample information independent of the money and drugs illegally seized from defendant's person to investigate the residence. That evidence did not, therefore, taint the additional evidence seized from the house, and its suppression was not required. State v. Pitts, 186 Vt. 71, 978 A.2d 14 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        When an aerial surveillance was a warrantless search forbidden by the Vermont Constitution, and the warrant authorizing the subsequent search of defendant's premises for marijuana plants was obtained solely on the basis of the aerial observations, the evidence seized upon executing the warrant should therefore have been excluded from defendant's trial. Since the error was clearly prejudicial, his conviction had to be overturned. State v. Bryant, 183 Vt. 355, 950 A.2d 467 (Mar. 28, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Exclusionary rule applied to civil driver's license suspension proceedings and was not limited to challenges to reasonableness of underlying stop, but could also be invoked by defendant challenging lawfulness of his arrest on jurisdictional grounds.

       </p>
       <p>
        Although driver's license suspension proceedings were civil in nature and did not demand all procedural safeguards required in criminal proceedings, exclusionary rule was properly applied in such proceedings in order to protect core value of privacy embraced in Vermont Constitution, to promote public's trust in judicial system, and to assure that unlawful police conduct was not encouraged. State v. Lussier, 171 Vt. 19, 757 A.2d 1017 (2000).

       <p>
        Where only impermissible conduct in government informant's entries into defendant's home was the use of an electronic body wire, and information conveyed electronically was not taken into consideration by trial court, informant's entries could not be viewed as illegal under totality of circumstances, and there was no reversible error in trial court's denial of defendant's motion to quash resulting search warrant as the product of an unconstitutional search.

        Persons who claim to have been subjected to an illegal pat-down search for weapons may file a motion to suppress any evidence discovered as a result of such a search, but must establish a causal nexus between the constitutional violation and the evidence sought to be suppressed in order to prevail.

        Facts were insufficient to provide probable cause that defendant's vehicle contained drugs and to seize it. A tip was so vague and general that it was of limited value even if it met the credibility standards of the rule governing search and seizure and properly identified the driver, and defendant's smoking and the presence of air fresheners in the car, his vague travel plans, his nervousness, the smell of marijuana, and his voluntary surrender of marijuana were insufficient to establish probable cause that he had more marijuana or other drugs.

       </p>
       <p>
        Trooper's seizure of plaintiff's vehicle violated plaintiff's rights under Article 11 of the Vermont Constitution. The seizure, aimed at immobilizing plaintiff's vehicle while the officer sought a search warrant, was essentially based solely on the trooper's initial detection of the faint odor of burnt marijuana, which did not, in and of itself, create a fair probability that marijuana would be found in the vehicle; the other factors posited by the State - the presence of an air freshener and a bottle of eye drops, in addition to plaintiff's statement that he had smoked marijuana in the past few days - did not add any probative evidence to establish probable cause to support the seizure. Zullo v. State, 209 Vt. 298, 205 A.3d 466 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        As defendant's truck idling in the middle of the night in a parking lot of an auto repair shop that had previously been burglarized was not sufficient, without more, to give police reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity, the vehicle stop was constitutionally violative, requiring suppression. State v. Paro, 192 Vt. 619 (mem.), 54 A.3d 516 (2012).
       </p>

        Having found that suppression was necessary, it was an error for the trial court to sidestep its suppression order by allowing the State to introduce evidence of "its" property being found on the floor in front of defendant as if it had not been illegally first discovered in his backpack. While not exposing the jury to an illegal search, the ruse nevertheless exposed the jury to the illegally obtained evidence. State v. Birchard, 188 Vt. 172, 5 A.3d 879 (2010).

        Regardless of whether power records were properly subpoenaed, a deputy's affidavit failed to provide sufficient information to establish probable cause when it did not show that a confidential informant (CI) was an inherently credible source or that the specific information provided by the CI in this instance was credible. A search warrant was therefore invalid. State v. McManis, 188 Vt. 187, 5 A.3d 890 (2010).

        Officers who stopped defendant were operating solely on a hunch; there was no reasonable and objective basis to suspect that he was then in possession of illegal drugs or engaged in any other criminal activity sufficient to justify an investigative detention. The detention was plainly invalid, therefore, and it was equally plain that the illegal detention irremediably tainted the consensual search of defendant's person which immediately followed. State v.

       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for selling cocaine, where the trial court suppressed an illegally obtained recording as well as evidence derived from use of the electronic monitoring device, the trial court did not commit reversible error when it allowed a confidential source to listen to the suppressed recording to refresh her memory prior to testifying because the source testified to her present recollection and her testimony was not based on "refreshings" with police officers.

        Merely suspicious surrounding circumstances of defendant's departure from a drug house and ingestion of something before stopping, followed by furtive and anxious behavior, without more, did not provide the probable cause necessary for arrest; consequently, there was no justification for a search incident to arrest, and the officer's initial pat-down, as well as his subsequent search of defendant for drugs, violated the U.S. and State Constitutions.

        Vermont Constitution did not require that prosecution demonstrate probable cause in order to obtain a nontestimonial identification order for collection of saliva from defendant's mouth; rather, a finding of reasonable suspicion to suspect defendant committed the offense was sufficient.

         25. Emergency assistance.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Search of defendant's home following a 911 call reportedly made by defendant's brother, who claimed to have been involved in a car accident 40 miles away, failed to satisfy the test for the emergency assistance exception, as there was no showing of an immediate need for police assistance at defendant's home. There was no evidence upon which to surmise that the brother had arrived at defendant's residence, injured or otherwise, between the time of the call and the dispatch of a trooper to the home, and the lack of a response to the trooper's knocking, without more, was insufficient to support a belief that anyone was inside the house or that there was an immediate need for medical attention. State v. Ford, 188 Vt. 17, 998 A.2d 684 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        By searching the grounds of defendant's home 40 miles from the site of a reported accident involving defendant's brother and peering into the basement windows when there was insubstantial evidence at the residence that anyone - let alone the potentially injured motorist - was home, a trooper exceeded the scope of any emergency that arose from the reported car accident, especially given the scant evidence connecting defendant's home with the 911 call. With the nature of the emergency very vague and no basis to associate defendant's empty house with that emergency, the scope of a permissible search had likewise contracted. State v. Ford, 188 Vt. 17, 998 A.2d 684 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Elements of the emergency assistance exception to warrantless entry are: (1) the police must have reasonable grounds to believe that there is an emergency at hand and an immediate need for their assistance for the protection of life or property; (2) the search must not be primarily motivated by intent to arrest and seize evidence; (3) there must be some reasonable basis, approximating probable cause, to associate the emergency with the area or place to be searched.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Police officers violated the Vermont Constitution by expanding the scope of a valid traffic stop into a drug investigation without reasonable suspicion of drug-related criminal activity when before issuing the suspended-license citation or returning defendant's license, they asked defendant to exit his vehicle, patted him down, asked to search his car and incorrectly told him that they had authority to seize it, said that they would request a canine unit to search the car, questioned him about his contacts with persons and places associated with drug-related crime, and purposely delayed completing the traffic stop. State v. Nagel, - Vt.
    - , 232 A.3d 1081 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Officer did not have a reasonable suspicion to expand the scope of a stop for suspected driving under the influence into a drug investigation, as he gained no information after the exit order that justified such an expansion, and therefore defendant's conviction of possession of heroin had to be reversed. The officer testified that after having defendant exit the vehicle and speak with him in his cruiser, he was not concerned that she was operating impaired; he did not mention any objective factual basis to support his suspicion that drugs would likely be found in the vehicle or in defendant's possession. State v. Dubaniewicz, 209 Vt. 490, 208 A.3d 619 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Stop of plaintiff's vehicle violated Article 11 of the Vermont Constitution because at the time of the stop, an obscured registration sticker did not violate the statute dealing with the manner of display of a license plate. Zullo v. State, 209 Vt. 298, 205 A.3d 466 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Stops of two vehicles after troopers learned that they were each owned by a person with a suspended license were supported by reasonable suspicion based on the troopers' knowledge that the owner of each car was under license suspension, and the reasonable inference that the driver of a car could be its owner. In neither case was there any assertion that the troopers were aware of information, such as the operator's gender, ethnicity, or age, inconsistent with the identity of the known registered owner. State v. Edmonds, 192 Vt. 400, 58 A.3d 961 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        In holding that after a traffic stop, defendant was properly detained to wait for a canine unit, the trial court erred in relying on the officer's knowledge of defendant's drug possession 12 days before the stop in question. Many courts have concluded that the fact of a prior arrest does not support a reasonable suspicion of current criminal activity; accordingly, the officer's knowledge of defendant's prior arrest did not - even in combination with an anonymous tip and the purportedly suspicious vehicles driving by the traffic stop - satisfy the Vermont Constitution. State v. Cunningham, 183 Vt. 401, 954 A.2d 1290 (Apr. 11, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's nervousness provided only meager support for a reasonable, articulable suspicion of drug activity. It is certainly not uncommon for a citizen stopped by police to be nervous, and many courts have found nervousness to be of limited significance in determining reasonable suspicion. State v. Cunningham, 183 Vt. 401, 954 A.2d 1290 (Apr. 11, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        While defendant's failure to prove ownership of the vehicle he was driving, produce identification, or show proof of insurance did justify a detention long enough to write citations for them, without more they provided inadequate support for an officer's suspicion of drug activity at the time of the stop. State v. Cunningham, 183 Vt. 401, 954 A.2d 1290 (Apr. 11, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was simply present - openly and in broad daylight - on a public thoroughfare in a town about 15 miles from his home. That he told the officer who stopped him for a traffic violation that there was "no particular reason" he was there did not bear any weight in establishing a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. State v. Cunningham, 183 Vt. 401, 954 A.2d 1290 (Apr. 11, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order not to become a full arrest, a frisk must be brief, its scope reasonably related to the justification for the stop and inquiry; thus, the excessive "intrusion" prohibited is defined primarily by the length and scope of a frisk. Neither the weather, a defendant's wish to be questioned indoors, nor the nature of the offense enter into a constitutional analysis of such a stop under either the United States or Vermont Constitutions, and the trial court erred in concluding otherwise. State v. Ford, 182 Vt. 421, 940 A.2d 687 (Sept. 28, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court did not abuse its factfinding authority when it weighed the officer's testimony against the video of his stop of defendant, where he described her vehicle touching the center line and gliding onto the fog line at least twice before he turned on his mobile video recorder, and then continuing this pattern at least two more times after he began to record, but, beyond this brief description of her driving, he never testified that the intra-lane weaving supported a suspicion that she might be driving while under the influence, and, additionally, he never testified that in his opinion, and based on his training and experience, when she touched the fog line, she committed a traffic violation sufficient to justify the stop. State v. Davis, 182 Vt. 573, 933 A.2d 224 (mem.) (July 25, 2007).

        Where a named informant provided police with a detailed description of defendant's vehicle, its make, model, license plate number, route, and direction of travel, and also reported that the operator "was possibly intoxicated and driving," the informant's tip contained sufficient indicia of reliability to justify the stop.

       <p>
        Police officer lacked a reasonable and articulable suspicion of criminal activity to justify the stop of defendant, who was a local man, driving down the public street at 8:30 in the evening, traveling in the direction of his home (a fact known to the officer), who stopped in a driveway approximately thirty minutes after and approximately two miles from reported criminal activity in which there was no reason to suspect he was involved.

       <p>
        Common law doctrine of sovereign immunity did not act as a jurisdictional bar to plaintiff's civil damage suit against the State alleging that a State officer deprived him of the protection from government interference guaranteed by Article 11 of the Vermont Constitution. Zullo v. State, 209 Vt. 298, 205 A.3d 466 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        The standard applied to evaluate defendant's immunity from plaintiff's State law claims alleging violations of the State constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches is the objective good faith standard under which "government officials performing discretionary functions generally are shielded from liability for civil damages insofar as their conduct does not violate clearly established statutory or constitutional rights of which a reasonable person would have known"; the good faith inquiry does not ask whether plaintiff's rights were violated, but rather whether the official reasonably should have known that what was being done violated plaintiff's rights. Stevens v. Stearns, 175 Vt. 428, 833 A.2d 835 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even where a State court has concluded that an individual is entitled to recover money damages for injuries resulting from the violation of a State constitutional right to be free from unreasonable searches, the test for qualified immunity is the same; it remains the same under any action arising from the State Constitution.

        There is no requirement that police obtain search warrants for vehicles immediately; such warrants must be obtained in a reasonable amount of time.

        Courts have approved inventory searches of lawfully impounded vehicles to protect the owner's property while in police custody, and have upheld the admission of evidence that the police would have "inevitably discovered" during such a search. The doctrine had no application where, prior to the illegal search, the officer testified that they had determined only to "ground" the vehicle, i.e., to leave it in place in the private lot where it was parked.

        Warrant application was supported by probable cause supplied from the records obtained through a subpoena, a neighbor's evidence, and a detective's background information on illicit wireless access. Given the rest of this evidence and information, an informant's reliability and the provenance of his tip was irrelevant to probable cause for the warrant. State v.

        When defendant was arrested on Saturday, it was not unreasonable for police to wait until Monday morning to apply for a warrant to search his car.

       <p>
        Because a defendant can argue that consent under Vermont's implied consent law was not given voluntarily for purposes of Article 11, and the trial court here did not hold an evidentiary hearing on the issue of voluntariness after defendant raised it, erroneously deciding instead that such a challenge was precluded by the implied consent law, remand for an evidentiary hearing was required. State v. Edelman, 208 Vt. 372, 198 A.3d 556 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trooper's decision to administer a preliminary breath test (PBT) to defendant rather than allow him to continue driving when defendant smelled of alcohol, admitted to drinking, and had bloodshot eyes was premised on a reasonable suspicion of driving under the influence (DUI), imposed a minimal intrusion on defendant's liberty, and was aimed at preventing serious danger to the public; it did not violate either the Vermont or the United States Constitution. The results of the PBT, in turn, provided probable cause to arrest defendant for DUI. State v. Mara, 186 Vt. 389, 987 A.2d 939 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        At the point a preliminary breath test (PBT) was administered, an officer needed only to have some basis for believing that a suspect might be driving under the influence; thus, when an officer smelled alcohol and saw that defendant's eyes were bloodshot and watery, this was enough to provide him with reasonable suspicion that defendant had been driving under the influence (DUI) and justified administration of the PBT and the subsequent dexterity tests. The results of those tests (including a 0.106 blood alcohol content and failure of six measures of dexterity) combined with the other observed indicia of intoxication provided the officer with probable cause to arrest defendant for DUI. State v. Santimore, 186 Vt. 638, 987 A.2d 332 (mem.) (2009).

        Preliminary breath test intrudes into an area that is the subject of legitimate expectations of privacy, and thus is a search under both the Vermont and United States Constitutions. State v. McGuigan, 184 Vt. 441, 965 A.2d 511 (2008).

        Given the marginal weight of the State's interest in DNA collection at the point of arraignment, balanced against the weight of the privacy interest retained by arraignees prior to conviction, the provisions that expand the DNA-sample requirement to defendants charged with qualifying crimes for which probable cause is found violates Article 11 of the Vermont Constitution.

       </p>
       <p>
        DNA sampling, by blood draw or by cheek swab, is subject to constitutional protections. An initial taking of a DNA sample, either by blood draw or by buccal swab, and the subsequent analysis, storage, and searching of the DNA profile are independent intrusions upon personal security that merit scrutiny under the search and seizure provision of the Vermont Constitution. State v. Martin, 184 Vt. 23, 955 A.2d 1144 (May 2, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Searches the DNA sampling statute authorizes are subject to clear administrative guidelines and are performed uniformly on all felons subject to them. Accordingly, they do not raise the specter of unbridled officer discretion to harass particular individuals, against which the search and seizure provision of the Vermont Constitution is a bulwark of protection. State v. Martin, 184 Vt. 23, 955 A.2d 1144 (May 2, 2008).

        Initial sampling in the DNA sampling statute, taken alone, does not violate the search and seizure provision of the Vermont Constitution. State v. Martin, 184 Vt. 23, 955 A.2d 1144 (May 2, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        What the DNA sampling statute authorizes is the creation, storage, and searching of a unique alphanumeric identifier based on analysis of 13 locations on DNA that are not associated with any known physical trait. This identifier is the only information contained in each person's database profile, and reveals no information about personal genetic traits that many people choose to keep private. State v. Martin, 184 Vt. 23, 955 A.2d 1144 (May 2, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        DNA sampling statute does not offend the search and seizure provision of the Vermont Constitution as applied to nonviolent felons, whether they are incarcerated or not. The statute serves special needs beyond normal law enforcement and advances important State interests that outweigh the minimal intrusions upon protected interests. State v. Martin, 184 Vt. 23, 955 A.2d 1144 (May 2, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        In light of the statutory limits on the analysis of genetic information, the post-sampling intrusion on protected privacy interests is closely akin to that occasioned by the retention and searching of fingerprint records; the data retained in the database serve only to prove identity, like a fingerprint. The information in the database, then, is not information defendants can reasonably expect to keep private as convicted felons. State v. Martin, 184 Vt. 23, 955 A.2d 1144 (May 2, 2008).

        Trooper's order that plaintiff exit his car did not violate Article 11 of the Vermont Constitution, and thus did not support plaintiff's claim for damages. The faint smell of burnt marijuana, in conjunction with the trooper's observations of items that might be used to mask the effects of smoking marijuana, provided the trooper with an articulable and reasonable basis to order plaintiff to exit his vehicle to determine whether plaintiff was driving impaired. Zullo v. State, 209 Vt. 298, 205 A.3d 466 (2019).

       <p>
        When defendant screeched his tires and revved his engine as he proceeded from a stop and turned the corner, and the road was dry and clear of snow and ice at the time, an officer could conclude that defendant's squealing of tires was intentional. It was thus reasonable for the officer to suspect that defendant did not have reasonable control of his vehicle, and the stop of defendant's vehicle therefore did not violate the Fourth Amendment and the Vermont Constitution. State v. Rutter, 189 Vt. 574, 15 A.3d 132 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Protections of the Vermont Constitution do not extend to prohibiting law enforcement officers from stopping motor vehicles where there is an objectively reasonable suspicion that a motor vehicle violation has occurred, even if in a particular situation these infractions may appear "trivial" or the officer's motivation is suspect. There was an objectively reasonable basis for stopping defendant for squealing his tires in violation of the statute applying to starting parked vehicles; therefore, defendant's argument of pretext lacked merit. State v. Rutter, 189 Vt. 574, 15 A.3d 132 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plain meaning of the statute pertaining to signals showed that a driver had to indicate an intention to turn within 100 feet of turning regardless of traffic conditions. Thus, because defendant's conduct of not using her signal until just before she turned violated the statute, a trooper had reasonable suspicion under the Fourth Amendment and the Vermont Constitution to make a traffic stop. State v. Fletcher, 187 Vt. 632, 996 A.2d 213 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case where defendant was stopped because he failed to use a turn signal when exiting a rotary, the court could not agree that any exit from any rotary was necessarily a change of direction; it was possible that in some rotaries, the entry and exit locations would be located in such proximity to each other that a vehicle could travel through the rotary without making any discernible or significant change in direction. Given this kind of possibility, and because the turn-signal statute was silent on the subject of rotaries, and the only statutory provision addressing rotaries was silent on the subject of turn signals, it was necessary for the State to demonstrate that defendant's exit off this particular rotary constituted a change of direction in order to justify the traffic stop; thus, remand for an evidentiary hearing on defendant's motion to suppress was required.

        Order that defendant exit her car was supported by an officer's reasonable suspicion that she was operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of heroin, given his observation that defendant had constricted pupils on an overcast day, the alleged track marks on the back of her hands, his observation that she no longer appeared to have symptoms of withdrawal from narcotics, as she had earlier that day, and her implausible excuse that she was traveling to a town in Massachusetts that had been the scene of recent drug transactions in order to buy cake from a grocery store there. State v. Dubaniewicz, 209 Vt. 490, 208 A.3d 619 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was probable cause to arrest defendant for driving under the influence, as the arresting trooper's experience with drunk drivers added weight and credibility to his observations and inferences; defendant ignored the trooper's blue lights, drove home, ignored the trooper's command to stay by his truck, and tried to enter his home; and defendant smelled of alcohol, slurred his speech, and was unsteady on his feet.

To the extent she was arguing that the Fourth Amendment, and its Vermont Constitution analog, nevertheless required some sort of warning to an individual asked to perform field sobriety exercises, she made no argument linking those constitutional provisions to the claimed warning requirement. State v. Farrow, 201 Vt. 437, 144 A.3d 1036 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Indicia of intoxication, such as an officer's detection of the odor of alcohol emanating from a driver as well as observation of a driver's watery and bloodshot eyes, are sufficient to establish reasonable suspicion of DUI. Here, the strong smell of alcohol and defendant's slurred speech were sufficient indicia of driving under the influence to allow the officer to go further and initiate field sobriety exercises. State v. Young, 189 Vt. 37, 12 A.3d 510 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Regardless of whether speeding in a snowstorm or being slow to pull over could properly be considered factors in the analysis, or whether the trooper could also properly consider the unopened bottles of beer in places such as defendant's jacket pocket and the center console, the factors of an odor of alcohol, defendant's admission to drinking, and the appearance of watery eyes were sufficient indicia of driving under the influence to validate an order for defendant to exit his vehicle. State v. Burgess, 188 Vt. 235, 5 A.3d 911 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court could not affirm the trial court's conclusion that a trooper's suspicion of driving under the influence became unreasonable for the sole reason that defendant passed two field sobriety tests; rather, the trooper was still faced with a situation in which defendant smelled of alcohol, had watery and bloodshot eyes, and admitted to drinking alcohol. The trooper testified that his training and experience suggested that the first two factors indicated possible impairment, and the third required no such training or experience to militate in favor of further investigation. State v. Mara, 186 Vt. 389, 987 A.2d 939 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although defendant's performance on walk-and-turn and one-leg-stand tests might not, by itself, have supported a reasonable suspicion of driving under the influence, it also did not as a matter of law compel a trooper to cease his roadside investigation. Although defendant did not "fail" the tests, his performance was not flawless, and the officer did not have to evaluate the test results in a binary fashion. State v. Mara, 186 Vt. 389, 987 A.2d 939 (2009).

        Because the bag last searched was not the same as the bag lawfully seized and opened by agents earlier, there was no "continuation of the legal search" of the same container tantamount to reviewing the same contraband once already in an officer's plain view. Thus, the introduction of evidence from the illegal search was not harmless. State v. Birchard, 188 Vt. 172, 5 A.3d 879 (2010).

        Aside from a bald assertion that the evidence should be suppressed "pursuant to . . . the Vermont Constitution, Chapter 1, Article 11," defendant proffered no particular argument or analysis to the trial court as to why this should be so.

         38. Testing of sex offenders.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Statutes such as that allowing sexual offenders to be tested for infectious diseases are directed at public health matters, not law enforcement, and therefore satisfy the first part of the special-needs standard for administrative searches; indeed, the statute explicitly states that samples taken of the sexual offenders "shall be used solely for the purposes of this section," and thus test results from the samples may not be used for criminal prosecution or other law enforcement purposes. Moreover, the courts have also recognized that imposing probable-cause and warrant requirements would be entirely impracticable in this context because many sexually transmitted diseases, and most particularly the AIDS virus, have no outward manifestations that would permit a probable-cause determination for obtaining a warrant; hence, requiring probable cause and a warrant for such searches would effectively preclude the testing of sex offenders and thus negate the statute. State v. Handy, 191 Vt. 311, 44 A.3d 776 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Degree to which convicted sex offenders may be subject to the more significant invasion of privacy associated with mandatory HIV testing is a function of how widely the results are disseminated. The risk of stigmatic harm therefore speaks not to whether the search should transpire in the first instance, but rather to the extent to which the private medical facts learned from the procedure should be disclosed; in short, the only privacy interest of any significance in this context is the risk of public dissemination of positive test results. State v. Handy, 191 Vt. 311, 44 A.3d 776 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the consensus among medical experts is that testing sex offenders for sexually transmitted diseases - particularly following conviction after months or even years have passed - has little or no direct medical benefit to victims, testing offenders can provide to victims some psychological benefit that outweighs the offenders' significantly diminished interest in preventing the testing of bodily fluids forced upon their unwilling victims. State v. Handy, 191 Vt. 311, 44 A.3d 776 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        As long as the trial court imposes restrictions that comport with the statute's obvious intent to prevent public dissemination of the perpetrator's test results, there is no constitutional infirmity to the allowing sexual offenders to be tested for infectious diseases under Vt. Const. Ch. I, Art. 11. The statute provides that the results of the offender's test shall be disclosed only to the offender and the victim; plainly, the Legislature was concerned with the privacy rights of offenders and chose to strictly limit revelation of their test results. State v. Handy, 191 Vt. 311, 44 A.3d 776 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court affirmed an order requiring defendant, a convicted sex offender, to submit to testing for sexually transmitted diseases. To safeguard defendant's privacy interests in not having any potential positive test results disseminated publicly, the court remanded the matter for the trial court to order the victim not to disclose defendant's test results to anyone except for the victim's medical provider or counselor, who, in turn, would have an obligation to keep confidential information revealed by their patients. State v. Handy, 191 Vt. 311, 44 A.3d 776 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Convicted sex offenders have greatly diminished privacy interests, particularly with respect to precluding the testing of bodily fluids forced upon their victims in criminal sexual acts. Moreover, the taking of a blood sample or a cheek swab is a relatively minimal intrusion on privacy. State v. Handy, 191 Vt. 311, 44 A.3d 776 (2012).

       <p>
        In light of the clarity of the conditions agreed to by defendant, a convicted sex offender furloughed to his home under a conditional reentry agreement, their nexus to the State's goals and defendant's legitimate expectation of privacy, and defendant's status on conditional reentry, defendant's privacy interest was quite weak, and the State's countervailing interests in promoting his rehabilitation and protecting the community was strong. Accordingly, reasonable individualized suspicion was not a prerequisite to the Department of Corrections' search of defendant's home and computer. State v. Bogert, 197 Vt. 610, 109 A.3d 883 (2014).

        None of the State's proffered alternative remedies would provide meaningful redress to plaintiff, who sought damages against the State for violation of his rights under Article 11 of the Vermont Constitution, as none of them could substitute as a viable remedy for someone subjected to an allegedly unconstitutional search or seizure, most particularly in a case like this where plaintiff was not charged with a crime. Zullo v. State, 209 Vt. 298, 205 A.3d 466 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff seeking damages against the State directly under Article 11 of the Vermont Constitution based on a law enforcement officer's alleged violation of that constitutional provision must show that: (1) the officer violated Article 11; (2) there is no meaningful alternative remedy in the context of that particular case; and (3) the officer either knew or should have known that the officer was violating clearly established law or the officer acted in bad faith.

        On the whole, the factors in the statute dealing with penalties in an environmental enforcement action reflect a primary legislative concern with protecting the public health and safety and preventing unjust enrichment at the expense of the State and the public. These considerations strongly suggest, in turn, a legislative intent to assign the careful balancing of equities that must necessarily underlie the decision to impose such civil penalties, and the amount of any penalty to be assessed, with the agency traditionally entrusted with such decisions: a judge rather than a jury. State v. Irving Oil Corp., 183 Vt. 386, 955 A.2d 1098 (Apr. 11, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a State environmental-enforcement statute has delegated the assessment of civil penalties in accordance with a highly discretionary calculation that takes into account multiple factors, this is the kind of calculation traditionally performed by judges rather than a jury, and does not require a jury trial. State v. Irving Oil Corp., 183 Vt. 386, 955 A.2d 1098 (Apr. 11, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Civil-penalties remedy under the statute pertaining to civil enforcement in environmental cases is essentially equitable. Accordingly, when the State sought civil penalties against an oil company, the company was not entitled to a jury trial under the Vermont Constitution. State v. Irving Oil Corp., 183 Vt. 386, 955 A.2d 1098 (Apr. 11, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the overarching remedy sought by the State was broad declaratory and injunctive relief to confirm an oil company's liability for contamination and to compel it to assume responsibility for its abatement, the right to jury trial under the Vermont Constitution did not attach. The prayer for reimbursement of response costs incurred to date was merely incidental to and intertwined with that effort; it complemented the equitable remedy and served to afford complete relief. State v. Irving Oil Corp., 183 Vt. 386, 955 A.2d 1098 (Apr. 11, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff had a right to trial by jury in his action claiming legal malpractice and breach of contract. Bloomer v. Gibson, 180 Vt. 397, 912 A.2d 424 (October 20, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        In handicap and sex-discrimination action brought under fair employment practices act, plaintiff was not entitled to trial by jury where complaint requested "back pay, restitution of wages, and other benefits including salary increases, costs, reasonable attorney fees and such other relief as the court deems just and proper"; complaint listed only equitable forms of relief and "other relief that the court deems just and proper" could not be construed to include legal damages. Hodgdon v. Mt. Mansfield Co., 160 Vt. 150, 624 A.2d 1122 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Vermont Constitution guarantees a right to jury trial to the extent that it existed at common law at the time of the adoption of the Constitution in 1793; the right to trial by jury is not restricted to those common-law causes of action recognized by the Vermont courts in 1793, but rather, the Supreme Court looks at the nature of the action and whether it is the type of controversy that would have been tried by a jury under common law at that time. Hodgdon v. Mt. Mansfield Co., 160 Vt. 150, 624 A.2d 1122 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Actions that may delay or condition the jury trial right do not by themselves infringe on that right, and a temporary delay in access to a civil jury trial is not equivalent to denial of the right. In re Vermont Supreme Court Administrative Direction No. 17, 154 Vt. 392, 579 A.2d 1036 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no right to trial by jury under this article at hearing under 23 V.S.A.

        1205 on refusal to submit to alcohol testing, as proceeding was unknown at common law. Shaw v. District Court, 152 Vt. 1, 563 A.2d 636 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plea agreement under which petitioner was sentenced included a condition of probation requiring petitioner to make restitution to arson victim for intentional infliction of emotional distress, imposition of restitution condition did not violate petitioner's right to trial by jury in civil cases guaranteed by this article; to the extent that the agreement addressed civil issues, it operated as a stipulation resolving any questions of civil liability and damages, and, therefore, petitioner's right to trial by jury was not triggered. In re Fadden, 148 Vt. 116, 530 A.2d 560 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        This article does not extend the right of trial by jury, but merely secures it to the extent that it existed at common law at the time of the adoption of the Constitution and, therefore, does not apply to an appeal to the Superior Court from a determination of the Commissioner of Taxes, because such an action was unknown at common law. Department of Taxes v. Tri-State Industrial Laundries, Inc., 138 Vt. 292, 415 A.2d 216 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the Superior Court is limited in an appeal from a determination of the Commissioner of Taxes to review on the record established before the agency, there is no issue of fact joined in a court of law, and therefore this article is by its own terms inapplicable to such an appeal. Department of Taxes v. Tri-State Industrial Laundries, Inc., 138 Vt. 292, 415 A.2d 216 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>

        Guaranty of right to trial by jury contained in this article has reference to right previously existing according to the course of the common law. Hall v.

       <p>
        This article applies to those cases proper for the cognizance of a jury according to the course of the common law and not to courts of equity, admiralty, or probate, which are not common law courts, their jurisdiction and practice being derived from the civil or canon law where no jury trials intervene. In re Weatherhead, 53 Vt. 653 (1881).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the first Constitution of this State provided that "in controversies respecting property, and in suits between man and man, the parties have a right to trial by jury, which ought to be held sacred," the change from this form of expression to the one used in this article was intended to define and restrict the loose and very general language of the old Constitution, and prevent its being misconstrued so as to make jury trials of universal application. Plimpton v. Town of Somerset, 33 Vt. 283 (1860); Hall v. Armstrong, 65 Vt. 421, 26 A. 592 (1893).
       </p>
       <p>
        This article applies to all controversies fit to be tried by a jury, according to the rules of the common law, notwithstanding the particular right for the violation of which the action is brought did not exist by common law, but was created by a statute passed subsequent to the adoption of the Constitution. Plimpton v. Town of Somerset, 33 Vt. 283 (1860).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Temporary moratorium of approximately five months on all civil jury trials created by a Supreme Court administrative directive in response to reduction in appropriation to support the courts did not offend this article; petitioners failed to show specific prejudice or that their trials were being delayed unreasonably, and administrative directive gave administrative judge authority to permit exceptions to the moratorium where justice required. In re Vermont Supreme Court Administrative Directive No. 17, 154 Vt. 392, 579 A.2d 1036 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petition for extraordinary relief challenging the constitutionality of an administrative directive of the Supreme Court creating a five-month moratorium on civil jury trials was properly before the Supreme Court only with respect to those of the petitioners who not only sought relief in Superior Court but who, following dismissal of the Superior Court action, sought an exception to the directive from the administrative judge. In re Vermont Supreme Court Administrative Directive No. 17, 154 Vt. 392, 579 A.2d 1036 (1990).

       </p>
       <p>
        No court can lawfully deprive one of the right to jury trial of an action at law. Shapiro v. Gore, 106 Vt. 337, 174 A. 860 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislature cannot extend jurisdiction of chancery as to cover and draw to it an action at law and give the court of chancery the right and power to determine it without the aid of a jury. Shapiro v. Gore, 106 Vt. 337, 174 A. 860 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where action at law was instituted on promissory note which was no part of debt secured by real estate mortgage, court of chancery in foreclosure proceedings was without authority to consolidate such action at law with the foreclosure proceedings as this would deprive plaintiff his right to jury trial in the legal action guaranteed by this article.

       <p>
        The term "sacred" as used in this article means no more than the word "inviolate," and does not mean that the mode of listing and selecting jurors shall forever remain unchanged, but only that the right shall be free from destruction or material impairment; hence, the Legislature has full authority to make reasonable laws regulating the mode in which the right shall be enjoyed, provided the right is not thereby materially impaired. State v. Mercier, 98 Vt. 368, 127 A. 715 (1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any law that destroys or materially impairs the right of trial by jury according to the course of the common law, in cases proper for the cognizance of a jury, is contrary to this article. Plimpton v. Town of Somerset, 33 Vt. 283 (1860).

       </p>
       <p>
        For purposes of constitutional challenge to jury selection process, State constitutional provisions that guarantee criminal defendants a right to an impartial jury and that provide that the right to jury trial should be held sacred afforded no greater protection than Sixth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.

      That the people have a right to bear arms for the defence of themselves and the State - and as standing armies in time of peace are dangerous to liberty, they ought not to be kept up; and that the military should be kept under strict subordination to and governed by the civil power.

         1. Right to bear arms.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Article 16 of the Vermont Constitution protects a right to bear arms in individual self-defense, subject to reasonable regulation. To the extent that Article 16 established a right to bear arms for the purpose of serving in a state militia, that aspect of the Article 16 right has no contemporary application as a Vermont state militia, viewed in the historical context, no longer exists. State v. Misch, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (Feb. 19, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        The language of this article does not suggest that the right to bear arms is unlimited and undefinable. State v. Duranleau, 128 Vt. 206, 260 A.2d 383 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        10 V.S.A.
        §
        4705(b), prohibiting the carrying of loaded rifles and shotguns in or on mechanically propelled vehicles on public highways, is not such an infringement of the right to bear arms guaranteed by this article as to be invalid. State v. Duranleau, 128 Vt. 206, 260 A.2d 383 (1969).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Article 16 of the Vermont Constitution protects a limited right to individual self-defense, and the proper standard for Article 16 challenges is a reasonable-regulation test. Under this test, the Court will uphold a statute implicating the right to bear arms provided it is a reasonable exercise of the State's power to protect the public safety and welfare. State v. Misch, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (Feb. 19, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        State reasonable-regulation test is the most appropriate standard for challenges under Article 16 of the Vermont Constitution because it is consistent with the Court's approach in
        <i>
         Duranleau,
        </i>
        the text and motivating ideals of Article 16, the nature of the right to bear arms, and the Court's previous rejection of rigid level-of-scrutiny tests. Under the reasonable-regulation test, the government may regulate firearms under its police power as long as its exercise of that power is reasonable; regulation is not reasonable if it effectively abrogates Article 16.

       <p>
        Large-capacity magazine ban satisfies the reasonable-regulation test used in connection with Article 16 of the Vermont Constitution because the statute has a valid purpose of reducing the lethality of mass shootings, the Legislature was within its authority in concluding that the regulation promotes this purpose, and the statute leaves ample means for Vermonters to exercise their right to bear arms in self-defense.

         1. Delegation of power.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        To avoid unconstitutional delegation of legislative power, a statute must establish reasonable standards to govern the achievement of its purpose and the execution of the power it confers. Vermont Home Mortgage Credit Agency v. Montpelier National Bank, 128 Vt. 272, 262 A.2d 445 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Legislature may confide a broad grant of authority to a subordinate agency in intricate matters affecting the general welfare in natural resources, health, education, and economics. Vermont Home Mortgage Credit Agency v. Montpelier National Bank, 128 Vt. 272, 262 A.2d 445 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Legislature cannot transfer its supreme legislative power to enact laws, but can confer upon the Executive and Judicial Branches of government, or grant to a subordinate agency of its own creation, a wide discretion in the manner and method for the execution of statutes validly adopted. Vermont Educational Buildings Financing Agency v. Mann, 127 Vt. 262, 247 A.2d 68 (1968), appeal dismissed, 396 U.S. 801, 90 S. Ct. 9, 24 L. Ed. 2d 58 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since legislation must often be adapted to complex conditions involving a host of details, with which the lawmaking body cannot deal directly, the Legislature may, without abdication of its essential functions, lay down policies and establish standards while leaving to selected instrumentalities the making of subordinate rules within prescribed limits and the determination of facts to which the policy as declared by the Legislature is to apply. State v. Auclair, 110 Vt. 147, 4 A.2d 107 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Legislature cannot delegate its authority to make the law, which necessarily includes discretion as to what it shall be, but may confer authority or discretion as to its execution. Village of Waterbury v. Melendy, 109 Vt. 441, 199 A. 236 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Delegation to administrative agencies of duties connected with the application of laws must not encroach upon strictly legislative functions. Village of Waterbury v. Melendy, 109 Vt. 441, 199 A. 236 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Functions of the Legislature that are purely and strictly legislative cannot be delegated but must be exercised by it alone. Village of Waterbury v. Melendy, 109 Vt. 441, 199 A. 236 (1938); State v. Auclair, 110 Vt. 147, 4 A.2d 107 (1939); Vermont Educational Buildings Financing Agency v. Mann, 127 Vt. 262, 247 A.2d 68 (1968), appeal dismissed, 396 U.S. 801, 90 S. Ct. 9, 24 L. Ed. 2d 58 (1969).

        Since the fact that legislation is submitted to a referendum of the people in no way lessens the supreme legislative power possessed by the General Assembly, a statute approved by such reference may subsequently be amended by the Legislature. 1966-68 Op. Atty. Gen. 61.

        There must be a certain amount of overlapping or blending of the powers exercised by the different departments; thus, the constitutional command must be construed consistent with efficient and effective governmental structures that are able to respond to the complex challenges and problems faced by today's State government. Hunter v. State, 177 Vt. 339, 865 A.2d 381 (October 22, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        In reviewing separation-of-power claims, Supreme Court applies a relatively forgiving standard, tolerant of overlapping institutional arrangements short of one branch virtually usurping from another its constitutionally defined function. State v. Nelson, 170 Vt. 125, 742 A.2d 1248 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not require absolute separation of powers among various departments or branches of government; when one branch exercises powers inherent to another branch, these powers must be such as are incidental to discharge of functions of department exercising them. Chioffi v. Winooski Zoning Board, 151 Vt. 9, 556 A.2d 103 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        This provision does not mean an absolute separation of functions as there must be a certain amount of overlapping or blending of the powers exercised by the different departments. Trybulski v. Bellows Falls Hydro-Electric Corp., 112 Vt. 1, 20 A.2d 117 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although this section provides for division of governmental powers among Legislative, Executive, and Judicial Departments, absolute and entire separation of functions would be impracticable, if not impossible. Village of Waterbury v. Melendy, 109 Vt. 441, 199 A. 236 (1938); State Highway Board v. Gates, 110 Vt. 67, 1 A.2d 825 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not require an absolute separation of governmental functions, for that would paralyze government. Sabre v. Rutland Railroad, 86 Vt. 347, 85 A. 693 (1913).

         2. Interference with powers of other departments.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The Legislative Branch may not overturn final decisions of the Judiciary with statutory enactments, whether they are specific to an individual case or of general effect. Burton v. Town of Salisbury, 173 Vt. 177, 790 A.2d 394 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendment of statute pertaining to appeals from the property tax grand list violated the separation of powers required by this section because the addition of the language "for the year for which appeal is being made" to the description of the rollback penalty applicable when there has been a complete reappraisal had the effect of undoing a final determination of the Supreme Court and divested taxpayers of a vested right. Burton v. Town of Salisbury, 173 Vt. 177, 790 A.2d 394 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        The power to decide when to include former Justices in the composition of the Supreme Court is a judicial power that does not belong to the Legislative Branch of government and cannot be exercised by it. Wolfe v. Yudichak, 153 Vt. 235, 571 A.2d 592 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not a legitimate function of the Supreme Court to expand a statute by implication unless it is necessary in order to make it effective, since to do so would usurp the exclusive prerogative of the Legislature by judicial legislation and violate the border lines drawn by this section. State v. Jacobs, 144 Vt. 70, 472 A.2d 1247 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Act that provided that no court could set aside any judgment, decree, or order entered before December 12, 1983, by the Superior Court on the grounds that the participation or nonparticipation of assistant judges was improper constituted a retroactive limitation of the court's jurisdiction over cases that had been commenced prior to the enactment of the act and was unconstitutional because it violated the separation of powers principle embodied in this section. Solomon v. Atlantis Development, Inc., 145 Vt. 70, 483 A.2d 253 (1984).

        Issue of whether trial court impermissibly delegated judicial authority by permitting probation officer to modify the plain meaning of a condition of probation, in violation of this article, was not preserved for review, as it was not raised before the trial court. State v. Gleason, 154 Vt. 205, 576 A.2d 1246 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial judge's redrafting of one count of information was not plain error in violation of this section where amendment did not alter State's intent to charge defendant as accessory to arson but was made to conform to technical requirement of arson statute.

        §
        4472, providing for trial de novo in Superior Court on appeal from decision of local zoning board, does not violate separation of powers provision of this section by allowing court to perform legislative or executive function; rather, local zoning board performs quasi-judicial function.

       </p>
       <p>
        13 V.S.A.
        §
        7041, which
    gives the State's Attorney power to decide whether to offer a recommended deferred sentence in exchange for a guilty plea and probation conditions,
    does not violate
    separation-of-powers principle established in the Vermont Constitution. State v. Pierce, 163 Vt. 192, 657 A.2d 192 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutory mandatory minimum sentence does not violate separation of powers doctrine; Judicial Branch does not have exclusive constitutional authority for sentencing criminals. State v. Saari, 152 Vt. 510, 568 A.2d 344 (1989).

        District Court lacked jurisdiction to review grounds and procedure for dismissal of police officer and issue findings of fact and conclusions of law; statute mandating such hearing within ten days of request of dismissed officer violated this provision.

       <p>
        By providing for mandatory one-year license suspension for DUI with fatality resulting, and vesting Commissioner of Motor Vehicles with exclusive authority to calculate suspensions and revocations, Legislature did not expressly or impliedly preempt trial court's probationary power to limit a defendant's operating privileges for longer periods; had Legislature actually intended to eliminate trial court's discretion to prohibit a defendant from driving as a condition of probation for grave vehicular offenses, it would have plainly said so. State v. Nelson, 170 Vt. 125, 742 A.2d 1248 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        No violation of separation of powers existed in State Supreme Court-created administrative motor vehicle license suspension procedure, where civil suspension rule was authorized by both State Constitution and statute, and Constitution itself established judicial power for rule promulgation. State v. O'Brien, 158 Vt. 275, 609 A.2d 981 (1992).

       <p>
        Standards imposed by statute delegating authority to the Secretary of Administration and the Joint Fiscal Committee to prepare and implement a deficit-prevention plan to address a revenue shortfall while the Legislature was not in session were sufficient for the exercise of the powers of the Secretary and the Committee. Hunter v. State, 177 Vt. 339, 865 A.2d 381 (October 22, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiffs failed in their argument that the Legislature could not delegate its power over appropriation to the Joint Fiscal Committee, the designated decisionmaker, because the scheme enabled the Legislature to delegate needed responsibilities to meet fiscal emergencies when it was not in session without ceding total control to the Executive Branch. Hunter v. State, 177 Vt. 339, 865 A.2d 381 (October 22, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the Legislature cannot delegate its legislative functions, it may confer upon administrative agencies the power to apply the general provisions of the law to particular circumstances. Vincent v. Vermont State Retirement Board, 148 Vt. 531, 536 A.2d 925 (1987).

        The provisions of 17 V.S.A.

        <span class="s1">
         §
        </span>
        2617, purporting to confer general jurisdiction on the Superior Court to hear and determine matters relating to elections, insofar as they relate to elections to the House of Representatives, are an improper delegation of legislative powers to a separate branch of government, the Judicial Branch, contrary to the separation of powers doctrine set forth in this section. Kennedy v. Chittenden, 142 Vt. 397, 457 A.2d 626 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        An election contest initiated in Superior Court under 17 V.S.A.
        §
        2603, governing contest of elections, had no support in law, and the Superior Court was without jurisdiction to hear and determine the cause as stated in the complaint, inasmuch as that section and section 17 V.S.A.
        <span class="s1">
         §
        </span>
        2617, purporting to confer general jurisdiction in election matters on the Superior Court, insofar as they related to elections to the House of Representatives, were violative of the constitutional doctrine of separation of powers since they improperly delegated legislative powers to the Judicial Branch in providing for a judicial determination as to the qualifications of electors and since the judicial adjudication contemplated under those sections was subject to revision or reversal by the General Assembly. Kennedy v. Chittenden, 142 Vt. 397, 457 A.2d 626 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        While this section does not mean an absolute separation of functions, and one department may properly be authorized to exercise certain powers that may in some manner pertain to another, these powers must be such as are incidental to the discharge of the functions of the department exercising them, and beyond this the powers of one department may not constitutionally be conferred upon another. In re House Bill 88, 115 Vt. 524, 64 A.2d 169 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is fundamental principle of American constitutional system, clearly expressed in this section, that Legislative, Executive, and Judicial Departments of government are separate from each other, and therefore such functions of Legislature as are purely and strictly legislative cannot be delegated, but must be exercised by it alone. State v. Auclair, 110 Vt. 147, 4 A.2d 107 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Though Legislature cannot delegate its legislative functions, yet, having by general law and charters made valid provisions applicable to railroad corporations, it may confer on Public Service Commission power upon investigation to apply the general provisions of law to particular circumstances.

Neither House during the session of the General Assembly, shall, without the consent of the other, adjourn for more than three days, nor to any other place than that in which the two Houses shall be sitting; and in case of disagreement between the two Houses with respect to adjournment, the Governor may adjourn them to such time as the Governor shall think proper. They may prepare bills and enact them into laws, redress grievances, grant charters of incorporation, subject to the provisions of section 69, constitute towns, borroughs, cities and counties; and they shall have all other powers necessary for the Legislature of a free and sovereign State; but they shall have no power to add to, alter, abolish, or infringe any part of this Constitution.

         2. Delegation of power.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Since legislation must often be adapted to complex conditions involving a host of details, with which the lawmaking body cannot deal directly, the Legislature may, without abdication of its essential functions, lay down policies and establish standards leaving to selected instrumentalities the making of subordinate rules within prescribed limits and the determination of facts to which the policy as declared by the Legislature is to apply. State v. Auclair, 110 Vt. 147, 4 A.2d 107 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Functions of the Legislature that are purely and strictly legislative cannot be delegated but must be exercised by it alone. Village of Waterbury v. Melendy, 109 Vt. 441, 199 A. 236 (1938); State v. Auclair, 110 Vt. 147, 4 A.2d 107 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Legislature cannot delegate its authority to make the law, which necessarily includes discretion as to what it shall be, but may confer authority or discretion as to its execution. Village of Waterbury v. Melendy, 109 Vt. 441, 199 A. 236 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Delegation to administrative agencies of duties connected with the application of law must not encroach upon strictly legislative functions. Village of Waterbury v. Melendy, 109 Vt. 441, 199 A. 236 (1938).

       <p>
        An enactment providing for an advisory referendum to obtain an expression of the view of the voters on ratification of an amendment to United States Constitution by the General Assembly, which would not be binding on the General Assembly, would lack the requisites of a law and be beyond the scope of the legislative powers under this section. 1972-74 Op.

       <p>
        A bill is the necessary form of procedure, rather than a resolution, when permanent direction and control of matters are to be taken, whereas a resolution is proper when the Legislature merely desires to express an opinion that has only temporary effect. 1964-66 Op. Atty. Gen. 85.

         6. Revenue bills.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Revenue bills, within the meaning of this section, refers to bills to levy taxes in the strict sense of the word, whose primary purpose is to raise revenue to be applied in meeting the general expenses and obligations of the government, and not bills that create revenue incident to other purposes. Andrews v. Lathrop, 132 Vt. 256, 315 A.2d 860 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the primary purpose of 32 V.S.A.
        §
        10001 et seq., the land gains tax, was to provide property tax relief and to raise revenue specifically to fund the tax relief program, it was not a revenue bill within the meaning of this section. Andrews v. Lathrop, 132 Vt. 256, 315 A.2d 860 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although it is dangerous, if not impossible, to define "revenue bills" within the meaning of this section, it can be said, by way of general guidelines based upon cases from other states and the United States Supreme Court, that (1) strict or narrow construction is the majority rule, a particular bill being ruled nonrevenue whenever possible; (2) a majority of the courts that have considered the question appear to have ruled that revenue bills are those the main or primary objective of which is to raise money by taxation; and if the raising of revenue, even if it is through a tax and essential to the accomplishment of the bill's objective, is merely incidental to the primary purpose, it is not a revenue bill; and (3) bills delegating taxing powers to municipalities are not revenue bills, because they do not, in themselves, raise revenue, but merely grant the power to do so. 1972-74 Op. Atty. Gen. 159.

         7. Adjournment.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Either house may adjourn Friday noon to the following Monday evening without the consent of the other, since the word "days" in this section, being unqualified, means calendar days, and when the computation of time within which an act may or may not be done is less than one week, Sunday is excluded. 1940-42 Op.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The authority given in this section to redress grievances, if not limited to proper and appropriate acts of legislation, would be giving the General Assembly authority as boundless, as the complaints of the citizens against each other are countless. Ward v. Barnard, 1 Aik. 121 (1825).

        The Legislature among its powers may create, direct, and control the local units of government within the State. 1964-66 Op. Atty. Gen. 146.
       </p>
       <p>
        Power of the Legislature to create subordinate government entities to deal with local affairs includes arrangements deriving from interstate compact agreements. Dresden School District v. Norwich Town School District, 124 Vt. 227, 203 A.2d 598 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is within the authority of the Legislature to implement the association of units of local government for the purpose of jointly operating school facilities located in Vermont and New Hampshire. Dresden School District v. Norwich Town School District, 124 Vt. 227, 203 A.2d 598 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Legislature may authorize a municipality to invest tax money outside the State in an agency not under State control. Dresden School District v. Norwich Town School District, 124 Vt. 227, 203 A.2d 598 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        The power to "constitute towns, borroughs, cities, and counties," vested in the Legislature by this section, is essentially a trust, requiring the exercise of judgment and discretion in its execution, and so nondelegable. In re Municipal Charters, 86 Vt. 562, 86 A. 307 (1913).
       </p>
       <p>
        The term "borroughs," as used in this section, includes villages. Atherton v. Village of Essex Junction, 83 Vt. 218, 74 A. 1118 (1910).

       <br />
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Every bill which shall have passed the Senate and House of Representatives shall, before it becomes a law, be presented to the Governor; if the Governor approve, the Governor shall sign it; if not, the Governor shall return it, with objections in writing, to the House in which it shall have originated; which shall proceed to reconsider it. If, upon such reconsideration, two-thirds of the members present of that House shall pass the bill, it shall, together with the objections, be sent to the other House, by which it shall likewise be reconsidered, and if approved by two-thirds of the members present of that House, it shall become a law.
     </p>
     <p>
      But, in all such cases, the votes of both Houses shall be taken by yeas and nays, and the names of the persons voting for or against the bill shall be entered on the journal of each House, respectively. If any bill shall not be returned by the Governor, as aforesaid, within five days (Sundays excepted) after it shall have been presented to the Governor, the same shall become a law in like manner as if the Governor had signed it; unless the two Houses by their adjournment, within three days after the presentation of such bill shall prevent its return; in which case it shall not become a law.

         1. Nature of power of Governor.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The power of approval or disapproval by the Governor of bills passed by the General Assembly conferred by this section is only a restraint on the supreme legislative authority vested in the General Assembly by section 6 of this chapter, and its nature cannot be extended by construction, especially in view of section 5 of this chapter, providing that the Legislative, Executive, and Judiciary Departments shall be separate and distinct, "so that neither exercise the powers properly belonging to the others."

         2. Acts requiring presentation to Governor.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Since any action of the General Assembly that apportions that body would be an act of legislation that would have the force and effect of law, any action by the General Assembly under which that body is reapportioned would have to be presented to the Governor as required by this section, regardless of whether the action taken is done by way of a bill or a resolution. 1964-66 Op. Atty. Gen. 85.
       </p>
       <p>
        The Governor is a necessary party to all acts of legislation. Kellogg v. Page, 44 Vt. 356 (1871).

       </h5>
       <p>
        This section does not require the Governor to sign a bill at its end in order that it become law; it is sufficient if he approves it and signs it in any place intentionally and understandingly. National Land & Loan Co. v. Mead, 60 Vt. 257, 14 A. 689 (1888).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where Governor signed a bill at the end of its second section by mistake and then erased his name with the intention of signing at the end of the bill, but failed to do so until after the time for signing bills had elapsed, the bill became a law when originally signed. National Land & Loan Co. v. Mead, 60 Vt. 257, 14 A. 689 (1888).

        Bill that was signed by the Governor within five days after presentment became law notwithstanding the fact that due to a clerical error it was delivered for his signature nine days after the General Assembly had adjourned. 1962-64 Op. Atty. Gen. 135.
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, the Governor is authorized to approve and sign bills in his hands for revision after the final adjournment of the Legislature, except that he is limited as to time to the period of five days (Sundays excepted) after the bill has been presented to him. Hartness v. Black, 95 Vt. 190, 114 A. 44 (1921).

       <p>
        Attorney General concluded that it was more likely than not that courts would sustain H.267 and that the Secretary of State should accept H.267 and prepare it for publication due to the plain meaning of the constitutional provision allowing bills to become law without the Governor's signature, the historical context of that provision, the fact that the Legislature approved H.267 and the Governor indicated that it should be "allowed to become law", the lack of judicial precedent that it should not become law, and the parallel circumstances of H.153 fourteen years prior. 2008 Op.

       <p>
        Where this section provided that, irrespective of any variances in the population of the towns, each inhabited town in the State might elect one Representative to the House of Representatives, it was in contravention of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U. S. Constitution and void. Buckley v. Hoff, 234 F. Supp. 191 (D. Vt. 1964), aff'd and modified, 379 U.S. 359, 85 S. Ct. 503, 13 L. Ed. 2d 352 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        The House of Representatives was grossly malapportioned, and the citizens of the State's larger communities were invidiously discriminated against because of the inequality of representation that resulted from this section, which gave each "inhabited" or organized town or city in the State one Representative. Buckley v. Hoff, 234 F. Supp. 191 (D. Vt. 1964), aff'd and modified, 379 U.S. 359, 85 S. Ct. 503, 13 L. Ed. 2d 352 (1965).

       <p>
        Legislature elected after this section [former version] and section 18 of this chapter [former version], relating to membership in the Senate, were declared invalid by a U. S. District Court served only at the will of the federal Judiciary, and when it acted on reapportionment, the sole source of its authority came from the Judicial Branch of the federal government, and was unrelated to its own constitutional powers and limitation. Smith v. Buraczynski, 125 Vt. 310, 214 A.2d 826 (1965).

       <p>
        Where this section [former version] and section 18 of this chapter [former version], providing for representation in the Senate, were declared void by a U. S. District Court, it was as if there were no provision in the Constitution for the composition of the General Assembly, and that being the case, the Legislature could provide by statute for the representation in each house, amend the Constitution on the matter of apportionment by legislative initiative pursuant to the procedure set forth in [former] section 68 of this chapter [now section 72], or call a constitutional convention for the purpose of proposing such amendments and submit such proposals to the people for ratification or rejection. 1964-66 Op.

        A district is not invalid merely because it straddles a county line. In re Reapportionment of Towns of Woodbury and Worcester, 177 Vt. 556, 861 A.2d 1117 (mem.) (September 13, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        In action by two towns challenging reapportionment, evidence of common social, economic, and political ties between the towns and the other towns in their new district, together with the other criteria - numerical equality, geographic contiguity and compactness, and political boundaries - provide a rational and legitimate basis for the Legislature's decision. In re Reapportionment of Towns of Woodbury and Worcester, 177 Vt. 556, 861 A.2d 1117 (mem.) (September 13, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Creating legislative districts to avoid contests between incumbents is a legitimate consideration that may justify minor deviations from equal representation as long as there is adherence to constitutional and statutory criteria regarding redistricting. In re Reapportionment of Town of Hartland, 160 Vt. 9, 624 A.2d 323 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence that boot-shaped legislative district breached county line did not establish violation of principles of compactness and contiguity where all towns in district shared at least one common border and network of State highways connected towns. In re Reapportionment of Town of Hartland, 160 Vt. 9, 624 A.2d 323 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        In challenging the formation of a district, the fundamental question is whether constitutional or statutory criteria have been violated, not whether the legislators intended to obtain some political advantage. In re Reapportionment of Town of Hartland, 160 Vt. 9, 624 A.2d 323 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Residents of a town are not disenfranchised simply because they make up a minority of their district; members of a group are disenfranchised only when they are denied an opportunity to effectively influence the election results by securing the attention of the winning candidate. In re Reapportionment of Town of Hartland, 160 Vt. 9, 624 A.2d 323 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Constitution mandates that House and Senate districts shall afford equality of representation, whereas the Constitution requires only that the Legislature seek to maintain geographical compactness and contiguity and to adhere to boundaries of counties. In re Reapportionment of Town of Hartland, 160 Vt. 9, 624 A.2d 323 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        The people of the State should determine the framework and composition of the General Assembly, the number of its members, and the length of their terms of service, the qualifications for membership, the number, size, and boundaries of electoral units, the number of legislators to be chosen from each unit - always having in mind that the seats in each house of a bicameral state legislature in order to meet the standard of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U. S. Constitution must be apportioned so as to provide substantially equal legislative representation for all citizens of all places within the state, and the weight of a citizen's vote cannot be made to depend on where he lives. Buckley v. Hoff, 234 F. Supp. 191 (D. Vt. 1964), aff'd and modified, 379 U.S. 359, 85 S. Ct. 503, 13 L. Ed. 2d 352 (1965).

       <p>
        Because the Vermont House of Representative's exclusive constitutional prerogative to be the "judge of the qualifications of its members" encompasses the authority to determine whether a member's personal or pecuniary interest requires disqualification from voting on a question before it, a legislative procedure was readily available to challenge the civil union vote on the grounds that a number of House members had a disqualifying personal interest in the outcome.

        Since whatever result reached in a judicial adjudication contemplated under 17 V.S.A.
        §
        2603, governing contest of elections, is subject to total revision or reversal by the exercise by the General Assembly of its acknowledged power over its own members as provided in this section, such power of revision, whether exercised or not, represents an intrusion prohibited by the doctrine of separation of powers and runs contrary to the precept that the exercise of judicial authority must lead to a final enforceable result and not be merely informative or advisory.

       </p>

        Intent to remain in Vermont, necessary to establish the residency requirement of this section, must be more than mere declarations of a party after the question of residence has become an issue and his future depends upon how that issue is resolved. 1962-64 Op. Atty. Gen. 213.
       </p>
       <p>
        The residency requirement of this section was met by an ex-resident of New York State who prior to the two-year period sold his real property in New York State and moved all his belongings to property owned by him in Vermont where he took up physical residence with his wife and started paying Vermont income taxes, even though he subsequently left the State for two extended trips, voted in New York State, and did not register his car, apply for his operator's license, or apply for listing on the poll list until after commencement of the two-year period. 1962-64 Op.

        Legislature elected after this section [former version] and section 13 of this chapter [former version], relating to membership in the House of Representatives, was declared invalid by a U.

        The people of the State should determine the framework and composition of the General Assembly, the number of its members, and the length of their terms of service, the qualifications for membership, the number, size, and boundaries of electoral units, the number of legislators to be chosen from each unit - always having in mind that the seats in each house of a bicameral state legislature in order to meet the standard of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment of the U.

     <p>
      The Governor, and in the Governor's absence, the Lieutenant-Governor, shall have power to commission all officers, and also to appoint officers, except where provision is, or shall be, otherwise made by law or this Frame of Government; and shall supply every vacancy in any office, occasioned by death or otherwise, until the office can be filled in the manner directed by law or this Constitution. The Governor is to correspond with other States, transact business with officers of government, civil and military, and prepare such business as may appear necessary, to lay before the General Assembly. The Governor shall have power to grant pardons and remit fines in all cases whatsoever, except in treason in which the Governor shall have power to grant reprieves, but not to pardon, until after the end of the next session of the General Assembly; and except in cases of impeachment, in which the Governor shall not grant reprieve or pardon, and there shall be no remission, or mitigation of punishment, but by act of legislation. The Governor is also to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. The Governor is to expedite the execution of such measures as may be resolved upon by the General Assembly. And the Governor may draw upon the Treasury for such sums as may be appropriated by the General Assembly. The Governor may also lay embargoes, or prohibit the exportation of any commodity, for any time not exceeding thirty days, in the recess of the General Assembly only. The Governor may grant such licenses as shall be directed by law; and shall have power to call together the General Assembly, when necessary, before the day to which they shall stand adjourned. The Governor shall be Captain-General and Commander-in-Chief of the forces of the State, but shall not command in person, in time of war, or insurrection, unless by the advice and consent of the Senate, and no longer than they shall approve thereof. And the Lieutenant-Governor shall, by virtue of office, be Lieutenant-General of all the forces of the State.

       </p>
       <p>
        Power of pardon conferred on Governor is exclusive and may not be restricted by Legislature nor, by the latter body, granted to any other person or group. 1958-60 Op. Atty. Gen. 242.
       </p>

        Governor is only officer who has power to grant pardons. 1944-46 Op. Atty. Gen. 133.
       </p>
       <p>
        Department of Public Welfare has no authority to release convict from terms of conditional pardon, as power and discretion relating to pardons vested by this section in Governor cannot be delegated. In re De Palo, 101 Vt. 510, 144 A. 678 (1929).
       </p>
       <p>
        Pardoning power conferred upon Governor cannot be taken away or restricted by Legislature, nor can like power be given by Legislature to any other officer or authority. In re Conditional Discharge of Convicts, 73 Vt. 414, 51 A. 10 (1901).

       <p>
        Power to pardon is a function of the State delegated to the Executive and conferred upon the office of Governor; it is not a personal act of the individual holding that office, but is an official declaration by the Chief Executive that a named person is relieved from the consequences of a specific crime or crimes. Doe v. Salmon, 135 Vt. 443, 378 A.2d 512 (1977).

        Pardon granted by Governor may be full and absolute, or partial and conditional, provided no condition of a pardon be illegal, immoral, or impossible. In re Conditional Discharge of Convicts, 73 Vt. 414, 51 A. 10, 1946-48 Op. Atty. Gen. 256 (1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        Power to grant pardons being conferred upon Governor by this section in unrestricted terms, except in cases of treason and impeachment, he has, except in such cases, authority to grant every kind of pardon known to the common law.

        Governor alone has power to release a convict from conditions imposed in granting a conditional pardon. 1946-48 Op. Atty. Gen. 256.
       </p>
       <p>
        Pardoning power vested in Governor by this section includes power to issue conditional pardons. In re De Palo, 101 Vt. 510, 144 A. 678 (1929); 1946-48 Op. Atty. Gen. 256.
       </p>
       <p>
        Conditional discharge which statute assumed to authorize Governor to grant was equivalent to conditional pardon, which Governor might grant, irrespective of the statute, by virtue of this section; neither is a remission of guilt, as is a full pardon.

        The power of pardon conferred upon the Governor by this section includes the remission, or excusing, of the penalty as well as the criminal act itself. 1958-60 Op. Atty. Gen. 242.
       </p>
       <p>
        A full pardon is considered to operate as a remission of the guilt of the respondent as to the offense involved. 1946-48 Op. Atty. Gen. 256.
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon a pardon being granted, the sentence of the court and all proceedings thereafter relating to probation of the respondent are superseded in effect, pending performance of the conditions of a conditional pardon by the respondent. 1946-48 Op. Atty. Gen. 256.
       </p>
       <p>
        A full pardon issued by the Governor under his authority as granted by this section not only contemplates and includes fines and imprisonment, but also costs and any other legal consequences which appertain to the conviction. 1940-42 Op. Atty. Gen. 189.
       </p>
       <p>
        The revocation of a license made mandatory by the conviction of a crime would be vacated upon the grant of a full pardon of such offense, but a full pardon would not operate to vacate a suspension of the license to operate a motor vehicle of the individual pardoned, if such suspension was made by the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles in the use of his discretion under sections 5108 and 5109 of the Public Laws [now 23 V.S.A.
        §§

        Under this section, which confers pardoning power upon Governor, power of reprieve does not pass by implication; but where circumstances of case are such that reprieve cannot be granted by court, as where court is not in session, then power belongs of necessity to Governor as chief executive magistrate. 1932-34 Op. Atty. Gen. 183.
       </p>
       <p>
        Order of Governor granting reprieve, made pending habeas corpus proceedings in federal courts, was not void when its purpose was to permit prisoner to appeal and not to render ineffectual or in anywise interfere with the jurisdiction and orders of the federal courts.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        To constitute a valid appropriation, it is not necessary that the money be in the Treasury at the time the appropriation is made, nor that the exact sum be stated by the Legislature. State Highway Board v. Gates, 110 Vt. 67, 1 A.2d 825 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is within the province of the Legislature to make an appropriation, the amount of which is to be ascertained in the manner specified in the act. State Highway Board v. Gates, 110 Vt. 67, 1 A.2d 825 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section was not intended to restrict power of Legislature over public revenue, and under it no particular form of expression is necessary for valid appropriation of moneys, it being only essential that Legislature by valid enactment assign to particular purpose a sum of money from the public revenues. City of Montpelier v. Gates, 106 Vt. 116, 170 A. 473 (1933); State Highway Board v. Gates, 110 Vt. 67, 1 A.2d 825 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Power to appropriate money is legislative in character and under this section is exclusively with General Assembly. Grout v. Gates, 97 Vt. 434, 124 A. 76 (1924).

        Under this section every person is entitled not only to a fair trial of his case, but to one as free as may be from suspicion of partiality. Ricci v. Bove's Administrator, 116 Vt. 406, 78 A.2d 13 (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is the duty of the court to conduct a trial with utmost impartiality and fairness. Morse v. Ward, 102 Vt. 433, 150 A. 132 (1930); State v. Hedding, 122 Vt. 379, 172 A.2d 599 (1961).

         3. Disqualification of judge.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Under this section, bias or prejudice on part of judge, existing to such an extent that an impartial hearing cannot be had, will disqualify him. Leonard v. Willcox, 101 Vt. 195, 142 A. 762 (1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        Bias or prejudice of judge sufficient to disqualify him under this section must be against party and not against the particular delinquency charged. Leonard v. Willcox, 101 Vt. 195, 142 A. 762 (1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mere showing of previous adverse rulings, no matter how erroneous or numerous, or mere showing of a judge's expression of opinion, uttered in what he conceived to be the discharge of his judicial duty, based upon evidence produced before him, is insufficient to disqualify judge under this section on ground of bias or prejudice. Leonard v. Willcox, 101 Vt. 195, 142 A. 762 (1928).
       </p>
       <p>
        The prejudice which disqualifies a judge from trying a person accused of crime is personal prejudice against the respondent, not prejudice against the particular offense with which he is charged. State v. Jurras, 97 Vt. 276, 122 A. 589 (1923).
       </p>
       <p>
        The guarantee of this section that justice shall be impartially administered does not render the Legislature without authority to declare that a judge, conducting an inquest upon a criminal matter under investigation by the State's Attorney, should not thereby be disqualified from presiding at the trial of the cause which was the subject of inquiry at such inquest.

       <p>
        Defendant's speedy trial rights under the Sixth Amendment and the Vermont Constitution had not been violated by the 23-month delay. Only five months of the delay were clearly attributable to the State, and while defendant timely asserted his speedy trial right, he was out on bail the entire time and had identified few specific claims of prejudice.

       </p>
       <p>
        In order to warrant reversal of a conviction under this section on the ground of appellate delay, defendant must show that substantial prejudice has resulted from the delay. State v. Hall, 145 Vt. 299, 487 A.2d 166 (1985).

         1. Authority over judges.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        There is little question that the Vermont Constitution, statutes, and Code of Judicial Conduct vest plenary authority in the Supreme Court of Vermont to exercise disciplinary control over all functions of assistant judges, administrative, adjudicative, and otherwise. In re Boardman, 186 Vt. 176, 979 A.2d 1010 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Nothing in the Constitution or its implementing legislation suggests that the scope of "judicial functions" or "judicial duties" subject to discipline is narrowly limited to adjudicative matters. On the contrary, the Vermont Supreme Court has consistently maintained - without dispute from the Legislative Branch - that the scope of the Court's disciplinary authority is comprehensive; it includes conduct unrelated to adjudicative proceedings, and even goes beyond the professional affairs of judges and into their nonjudicial lives. In re Boardman, 186 Vt. 176, 979 A.2d 1010 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that a judge has left the bench does not preclude the Supreme Court from exercising jurisdiction to discipline judges for conduct committed during their judicial tenure. In re Steady, 161 Vt. 636, 641 A.2d 117 (mem.) (1994).

         2. Authority over attorneys.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In assisting the Supreme Court with judicial conduct proceedings, the Professional Conduct Board collects facts and advises the Court of its findings; although the Board's recommendations are shown "deference," they are not binding on the Court, and the Court has the final decision concerning discipline. In re Gadbois, 173 Vt. 59, 786 A.2d 393 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Professional Conduct Board acts on behalf of Supreme Court and pursuant to rules adopted by Court, and Court retains inherent power to dispose of individual cases of lawyer discipline. In re Berk, 157 Vt. 524, 602 A.2d 946 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not the Supreme Court's function to "review" the findings and recommendations of the Professional Conduct Board, but to make the only final and ultimate decision upon petitions for readmission to the practice of law, based upon the Court's responsibility under this section for regulation and discipline of the legal profession. In re Harrington, 134 Vt. 549, 367 A.2d 161 (1976).

         3. Judicial assignments.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The power to decide when to include former Justices in the composition of the Supreme Court is a judicial power that does not belong to the Legislative Branch of government and cannot be exercised by it. Wolfe v. Yudichak, 153 Vt. 235, 571 A.2d 592 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        The assignment and reassignment of judges among territorial units of the District Court is part of the administrative control given to the Supreme Court by this section. Ketcham v. Lehner, 149 Vt. 314, 542 A.2d 290 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The power of the Governor to appoint district judges is to appoint to the District Court as a single court, irrespective of assignment; the power of assignment, regular or special, is in the Judicial Branch. Ketcham v. Lehner, 149 Vt. 314, 542 A.2d 290 (1988).

         4. Change of venue.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Supreme Court had power to transfer venue of criminal trial after assistant judge, who was disqualified by presiding judge for alleged improper action with respect to an interlocutory appeal, filed a petition in Supreme Court challenging disqualification. State v. Hunt, 150 Vt. 483, 555 A.2d 369 (1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1026, 109 S. Ct. 1155, 103 L. Ed. 2d 214 (1989).

         5. Disqualification of judge.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Principle of necessity required that Supreme Court Justices sit on a case challenging the constitutionality of a moratorium on civil jury trials, which had been ordered by the Court; since the challenged actions were taken by the Justices in their official capacity, appointment of substitute justices would not eliminate the asserted disqualification to act. In re Vermont Supreme Court Administrative Directive No. 17, 154 Vt. 217, 576 A.2d 127 (1990).

         7. Resentencing.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        When defendant was convicted on two counts of boating while intoxicated, and the second count was reversed on appeal because both convictions arose out of the same incident, the court had the power to order resentencing on the remaining count when the trial court had sentenced defendant on the first count based on harm to only one of the two victims. Defendant by appealing his convictions placed the entire judgment in issue, and the holding on appeal in no way decreased his culpability or called into question the sentencing judge's assessment of the scope of the necessary punishment. State v. Martin, 185 Vt. 286, 973 A.2d 56 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a defendant challenges his convictions in a case where his sentences are interdependent, that challenge necessitates review and redetermination of the full sentencing package. Remands are therefore necessary in aid of the court's appellate jurisdiction, and to ensure the regular execution of the law; the District Court, although its power to resentence is limited, may be imbued with that power by a proper order of the Supreme Court of Vermont. State v. Martin, 185 Vt. 286, 973 A.2d 56 (2009).

        Plain meaning of the governing language of the Vermont Constitution grants the Governor authority to appoint a Justice only when a "vacancy" in the office exists. The plain meaning of the word "vacancy" is manifest: The leading legal dictionary unambiguously defines the word "vacancy" as follows: 1. The quality, state, or condition of being unoccupied, esp. in reference to an office; 2. The time during which an office is not occupied; 3. An unoccupied office; a vacancy, properly speaking, does not occur until the officer is officially removed; 4. A job opening; a position that has not been filled. Turner v. Shumlin, 204 Vt. 78, 163 A.3d 1173 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont Constitution did not authorize the Governor to appoint an Associate Justice of the Court in anticipation of a vacancy that was not expected to occur until the expiration of the Justice's term of office, which would occur months after the Governor left office.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When the Senate is not in session, the Governor may make an interim appointment to fill a vacancy in the office of chief justice, associate justice of the Supreme Court or judge of any other court, except the office of Assistant Judge and of Judge of Probate, from a list of nominees presented by the judicial nominating body. A justice or judge so appointed shall hold office, with all the powers incident to the office, until the Senate convenes and acts upon the appointment submitted by the Governor. Thereafter, the appointee shall continue in office if the Senate consents to the appointment. If the appointment is not confirmed upon vote of the Senate, the appointment shall be terminated and a vacancy in the office will be created.

       <p>
        Authority of a Supreme Court Justice who has sat at the hearing of a case to complete work on that matter is fixed by the status of the Justice on the hearing date; subsequent resignation or retirement does not change this authority. Wolfe v. Yudichak, 153 Vt. 235, 571 A.2d 592 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Practice of the Supreme Court, that a Justice who resigns or retires from the Court after hearing a matter may participate fully in consideration of the case thereafter, is grounded in the Court's inherent judicial and administrative powers as found in this section, conflicts neither with the Governor's power to appoint nor with the Senate's power to confirm, and relates strictly and narrowly to the Court's inherent power to complete in succeeding terms what was begun in earlier ones.

        This section's mandate that all judges retire at age 70, not shown to violate any recognized fundamental personal right, furthered legitimate State interest in requiring the highest possible standards of members of the Judiciary by minimizing the threat of an obviously disabled judge continuing to preside in full view of the public and would not be held unconstitutional.

        This section's provision mandating retirement of judges at age 70 is not invalid for interfering with a person's right to run for office, as plaintiff assistant judges over 70 wished to do, and of the voters to vote for the candidate of their choice, and is a proper exercise of a constitutional limitation to hold the Judiciary to the highest possible standards, as desired by the people.

         1. Authority over judges.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        There is little question that the Vermont Constitution, statutes, and Code of Judicial Conduct vest plenary authority in the Supreme Court of Vermont to exercise disciplinary control over all functions of assistant judges, administrative, adjudicative, and otherwise. In re Boardman, 186 Vt. 176, 979 A.2d 1010 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Nothing in the Constitution or its implementing legislation suggests that the scope of "judicial functions" or "judicial duties" subject to discipline is narrowly limited to adjudicative matters. On the contrary, the Vermont Supreme Court has consistently maintained - without dispute from the Legislative Branch - that the scope of the court's disciplinary authority is comprehensive; it includes conduct unrelated to adjudicative proceedings, and even goes beyond the professional affairs of judges and into their nonjudicial lives. In re Boardman, 186 Vt. 176, 979 A.2d 1010 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Section in the Vermont Constitution that permits the General Assembly to establish procedures for the implementation of the provisions regarding the Judiciary does not authorize the Governor to create, as opposed to fill, a vacancy. Turner v. Shumlin, 204 Vt. 78, 163 A.3d 1173 (2017).

       <p>

       <p>
        Plaintiff had a right to trial by jury in his action claiming legal malpractice and breach of contract. Bloomer v. Gibson, 180 Vt. 397, 912 A.2d 424 (October 20, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no right to trial by jury under this section at hearing under 23 V.S.A.
        §
        1205 on refusal to submit to alcohol testing as proceeding was unknown at common law. Shaw v. District Court, 152 Vt. 1, 563 A.2d 636 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Parties are not entitled to jury trial as matter of right in probate appeals. In re Welch's Will, 69 Vt. 127, 37 A. 250 (1896).
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to trial by jury guaranteed by Constitution applies only to cases in which that right was enjoyed at common law. Hall v. Armstrong, 65 Vt. 421, 26 A. 592 (1893); Crampton v. Hollister, 70 Vt. 633, 41 A. 588 (1898).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section applies to those cases proper for the cognizance of a jury according to the course of the common law and not to courts of equity, admiralty, or probate, which are not common law courts, their jurisdiction and practice being derived from the civil or canon law where no jury trials intervene. In re Weatherhead, 53 Vt. 653 (1881).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section applies to all controversies fit to be tried by a jury, according to the rules of the common law, notwithstanding the particular right for the violation of which the action is brought did not exist by common law, but was created by a statute passed subsequent to the adoption of the Constitution. Plimpton v. Town of Somerset, 33 Vt. 283 (1860).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Actions that may delay or condition the jury trial right do not by themselves infringe on that right, and a temporary delay in access to a civil jury trial is not equivalent to denial of the right. In re Vermont Supreme Court Administrative Directive No. 17, 154 Vt. 392, 579 A.2d 1036 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Temporary moratorium of approximately five months on all civil jury trials created by a Supreme Court administrative directive in response to reduction in appropriation to support the courts did not offend this article; petitioners failed to show specific prejudice or that their trials were being delayed unreasonably, and administrative directive gave administrative judge authority to permit exceptions to the moratorium where justice required. In re Vermont Supreme Court Administrative Directive No. 17, 154 Vt. 392, 579 A.2d 1036 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petition for extraordinary relief challenging the constitutionality of an administrative directive of the Supreme Court creating a five-month moratorium on civil jury trials was properly before the Supreme Court only with respect to those of the petitioners who not only sought relief in Superior Court but who, following dismissal of the Superior Court action, sought an exception to the directive from the administrative judge. In re Vermont Supreme Court Administrative Directive No. 17, 154 Vt. 392, 579 A.2d 1036 (1990).

        Forty-one-year-old defendant charged with second-degree murder could not contest jury venire or array which underrepresented young adults up to the age of 24 he made no attempt to show or argue that he was prejudiced by the impartial but nonrepresentative jury. State v. Pelican, 154 Vt. 496, 580 A.2d 942 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont constitutional provision that requires that great care be taken to prevent corruption or partiality in the choice and return, or appointment, of juries requires an impartial and competent jury, but not a representative one. State v. Pelican, 154 Vt. 496, 580 A.2d 942 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The constitutional right to trial by jury guarantees that each juror will be unbiased and without prejudice toward any party. Isabelle v. Proctor Hospital, 129 Vt. 500, 282 A.2d 837 (1971).

        Facts underlying defendant's equitable-estoppel defense were not within the trial court's purview to address in the first instance. Plaintiffs' right to a jury trial included a right to trial by jury on the factual issues underlying the defense of equitable estoppel. LeBlanc v. Snelgrove, 200 Vt. 570, 133 A.3d 361 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendants in contract actions have no constitutional right to have amount of attorneys' fees determined by a jury, since determination of the amount of attorneys' fees involves equitable accounting, and there is no right to a jury trial in equitable matters. Murphy v. Stowe Club Highlands, 171 Vt. 144, 761 A.2d 688 (2000).

        A penalty is not constitutionally excessive unless it is grossly disproportionate or out of all just proportion to the offense; accordingly, defendant could not seriously challenge the Legislature's judgment in authorizing a one to 15 year sentence for the crime of careless and negligent driving with serious injury resulting.

        Potential punishment of ten years in jail for each count of multi-count prosecution for knowingly filing false claims with State Medicaid program was not grossly disproportionate to offense; comparable federal crime was felony, misdemeanor penalties were found by Congress to be inadequate deterrents, maximum penalties for Medicaid fraud in other states were similar, and some penalties for comparable Vermont crimes were felonies.

       § 40.
     [Excessive bail prohibited; prisoners bailable; imprisonment for debt prohibited].
       <br />
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Excessive bail shall not be exacted for bailable offenses. All persons shall be bailable by sufficient sureties, except as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      (1) A person accused of an offense punishable by death or life imprisonment may be held without bail when the evidence of guilt is great.
     </p>
     <p>
      (2) A person accused of a felony, an element of which involves an act of violence against another person, may be held without bail when the evidence of guilt is great and the court finds, based upon clear and convincing evidence, that the person's release poses a substantial threat of physical violence to any person and that no condition or combination of conditions of release will reasonably prevent the physical violence. A person held without bail prior to trial under this paragraph shall be entitled to review de novo by a single justice of the Supreme Court forthwith.
     </p>
     <p>
      (3) A person awaiting sentence, or sentenced pending appeal, may be held without bail for any offense.
     </p>
     <p>
      A person held without bail prior to trial shall be entitled to review of that determination by a panel of three Supreme Court Justices within seven days after bail is denied.
     </p>
     <p>
      Except in the case of an offense punishable by death or life imprisonment, if a person is held without bail prior to trial, the trial of the person shall be commenced not more than 60 days after bail is denied. If the trial is not commenced within 60 days and the delay is not attributable to the defense, the court shall immediately schedule a bail hearing and shall set bail for the person.
     </p>
     <p>
      No person shall be imprisoned for debt.

        In determining the meaning of the term "review de novo" in bail amendment to the Constitution and related statute, the court would look primarily to the intent of the voters in approving the amendment but also would consider the intent of the Legislature in adopting the statute. State v. Madison, 163 Vt. 360, 658 A.2d 536 (1995).

        .
       </h5>
       <p>
        In finding that a sexual assault defendant could be held without bail, the trial court properly found that the evidence of guilt was great, as the testimony of the alleged victim, even if ambivalent, could provide a legally sufficient basis for a guilty verdict if found credible. State v. Bertrand, 185 Vt. 574, 967 A.2d 1137 (mem.) (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the record of the proceedings below did not indicate how the trial court, which denied bail, exercised its discretion in rejecting defendant's proposed conditions of release, remand was required for the trial court to make findings on this issue. State v. Bertrand, 185 Vt. 574, 967 A.2d 1137 (mem.) (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        In cases where constitutional right to bail does not apply, presumption is switched so that the norm is incarceration and not release, trial court's discretion is extremely broad, and trial court must exercise its discretion after giving defendant an opportunity to be heard. State v. Blackmer, 160 Vt. 451, 631 A.2d 1134 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Preventive detention of potentially dangerous persons is not constitutionally acceptable. State v. Sauve, 159 Vt. 566, 621 A.2d 1296 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Repeatedly violating conditions of release, without more, does not rise to the level of a compelling interest sufficient to justify revocation of bail. State v. Sauve, 159 Vt. 566, 621 A.2d 1296 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Vermont Constitution explicitly guarantees bail as a matter of right to defendants not charged with offenses punishable by death or life imprisonment. State v. Sauve, 159 Vt. 566, 621 A.2d 1296 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont constitutional values require that liberty is and must remain the norm and detention prior to trial or without trial is the carefully limited exception; although some exceptions may exist to the right to bail, these are limited to special circumstances where the State's interest is legitimate and compelling. State v. Sauve, 159 Vt. 566, 621 A.2d 1296 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Withholding bail for repeatedly violating conditions of release is unconstitutional unless there is a nexus between the repeated violations and a disruption of the prosecution. State v. Sauve, 159 Vt. 566, 621 A.2d 1296 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a bail hearing in which the trial court is required to determine whether a defendant is bailable in light of evidence of guilt, the trial court is not required to consider a challenge to admission of evidence if substantial admissible evidence of guilt exists without considering the evidence challenged, but if the State cannot make such a showing, the court must determine if the State can make a prima facie case that the challenged evidence would be admissible at trial. State v. Passino, 154 Vt. 377, 577 A.2d 281 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court has discretion to release a criminal defendant on bail even if defendant is not bailable as of right; however, it is under no obligation to do so. State v. Passino, 154 Vt. 377, 577 A.2d 281 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        In bail appeal in which defendant, who was charged with an offense punishable by life imprisonment, challenged the trial court's reliance on evidence subject to a motion to suppress, remand was required for trial court's consideration of whether State could make a prima facie showing the challenged evidence would be admissible at trial. State v. Passino, 154 Vt. 377, 577 A.2d 281 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's failure to exercise its discretion to consider bail for defendant charged with first degree murder not bailable as of right required remand for such consideration. State v. Passino, 154 Vt. 377, 577 A.2d 281 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Provision in this section for bail is a necessary corollary to the constitutional concept that persons may be imprisoned only after proper conviction of crime. State v. Mecier, 136 Vt. 336, 388 A.2d 435 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Anticipatory confinement or preventive detention is obstructed by this section. State v. Mecier, 136 Vt. 336, 388 A.2d 435 (1978).

       </h5>
       <p>
        To meet substantive due process requirements, bail cannot be denied in order to inflict pretrial punishment, pretrial detention cannot be excessive in relation to regulatory goal, and interests served by the detention must be legitimate and compelling. State v. Blackmer, 160 Vt. 451, 631 A.2d 1134 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of bail, as mandated by this section, is to assure the defendant's presence in court. State v. Pray, 133 Vt. 537, 346 A.2d 227 (1975).

       <p>
        A condition of bail designed solely for the protection of the public may be imposed. State v. Brown, 136 Vt. 561, 396 A.2d 134 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        To use bail solely as a device for protecting the public would violate this section. State v. Cyr, 134 Vt. 460, 365 A.2d 969 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Bail may not be entirely denied a defendant on grounds that his release would constitute a danger to the public. State v. Pray, 133 Vt. 537, 346 A.2d 227 (1975); State v. Mecier, 136 Vt. 336, 388 A.2d 435 (1978).

       <p>
        Provision of this section pertaining to right to bail does not apply where a prisoner is held for extradition, because the prisoner is not being held for trial in Vermont for alleged violation of criminal law; in extradition matters, there is no offense, but only proceedings to produce a demanded person for another state.

        Provision allowing revocation of bail due to the commission of a felony or a crime against a person is subject to the same constitutional analysis as the provision related to the repeated violation of the conditions of release, and the Vermont Constitution provision does not have an exception for multiple charges; if the statutory elements were sufficient, a second qualifying charge for which probable cause is found would virtually always allow for revocation of conditions of release even though the second charge is for a bailable offense because the condition that defendant not be charged with a crime for which probable cause is found is a standard condition virtually always imposed. State v. Gates, 201 Vt. 502, 145 A.3d 233 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Superior Court erred by revoking defendant's bail due to repeated violations of the conditions of release because the findings were insufficient to show a violation of the statute authorizing bail revocation since there was no showing that the victim feared reprisal for her testimony, there was no finding of a nexus between the violations and a disruption of prosecution, the repeated violations alone were not sufficient to meet the standard under the Vermont Constitution, the State did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant committed the crime of obstruction of justice, and it was not enough to just meet the statutory elements for a felony or a crime against persons. State v. Gates, 201 Vt. 502, 145 A.3d 233 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statutory provisions providing for revocation of bail if defendant intimidates or harasses a victim or witness, or violates a condition of release that constitutes a threat to the integrity of the judicial system, are both based on the compelling State interest in prosecuting those accused of violating its laws. State v. Sauve, 159 Vt. 566, 621 A.2d 1296 (1993).

        Trial court utilized the proper standard of review for denial of bail to defendant charged with an offense punishable by life imprisonment, i.e., "whether the evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the State and excluding modifying evidence, can fairly and reasonably show defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt" and properly excluded affidavits submitted by defendant, holding that they represented conflicting or modifying evidence.

        Charging defendant as habitual criminal was not "double enhancement" of his prior convictions for DUI, and since defendant properly faced charge punishable by life imprisonment, he could lawfully be held without bail. State v. Gardner, 167 Vt. 600, 709 A.2d 499 (mem.) (1998).

       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of bail to defendant charged with aggravated sexual assault on a nine-year-old girl did not deny defendant of procedural due process. State v. Blackmer, 160 Vt. 451, 631 A.2d 1134 (1993).

       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant charged with an offense punishable by life imprisonment could be held without bail if State established by affidavits, depositions, sworn oral testimony, or other admissible evidence that it had substantial, admissible evidence as to the elements of the offense sufficient to prevent the grant of a motion for judgment of acquittal of trial. State v. Blackmer, 160 Vt. 451, 631 A.2d 1134 (1993).

        To deny bail to defendant charged with an offense punishable by life imprisonment, trial court must make a specific finding that State has shown that facts exist that are legally sufficient to sustain a verdict of guilty. State v. Duff, 151 Vt. 433, 563 A.2d 258 (1989).

       </h5>
       <p>
        "Modifying evidence" for purposes of determining whether to deny bail is testimonial evidence introduced by the defense in contravention to the State's evidence, the credibility or weight of which is ultimately for the factfinder's determination. State v. Stolte, 191 Vt. 600, 44 A.3d 166 (mem.) (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether to deny defendant bail, it was error to necessarily equate defendant's new DNA evidence, purportedly undisputed as to its foundation, with disputed, testimonial "modifying evidence." On remand, if the proffered evidence, if relevant, was disputed either as to its origin or result as a matter of fact, then the evidence was modifying evidence; if no such conflict existed, the court had to determine whether, if admissible, the evidence would have made a difference to its initial determination on whether the State's prima facie evidence of guilt was "great" for purposes of holding defendant without bail. State v. Stolte, 191 Vt. 600, 44 A.3d 166 (mem.) (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        While testimonial evidence raises inherent credibility questions not properly resolved by judges at bail denial hearings, non-testimonial evidence does not. Non-testimonial evidence is any evidence that does not derive and depend on the observation, recollection, reliability, or veracity of witnesses, whether in the form of live testimony or a sworn statement, and which therefore does not implicate a credibility determination. State v. Stolte, 191 Vt. 600, 44 A.3d 166 (mem.) (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Examples of non-testimonial evidence at bail denial hearings can include DNA analysis, photographs, or other physical evidence, the provenance of which is not contested. Where the validity of such non-testimonial evidence is undisputed, there is no question of credibility; for example, in the case of an indisputably valid DNA result, the jury would not be required to decide whether it believed the test result, but only what it proved. State v. Stolte, 191 Vt. 600, 44 A.3d 166 (mem.) (2012).

        When defendant had originally been ordered to be held without bail, but his trial could not be held within 60 days due to an order suspending trials in the State to contain the spread of coronavirus, the trial court did not err in releasing him on conditions but without imposing bail, as it found that defendant did pose a risk of flight, but his failures to appear were from 2012 and 2015, he could reside at a motel under staff supervision and with a 24-hour curfew, and his age and need for cancer treatment at a local hospital mitigated his risk of flight.

       <p>
        Court holds that State v. Lontine was decided incorrectly and overrules that decision. The language, history, and purpose of the relevant constitutional and statutory provisions compel a conclusion that a defendant is entitled to trial or a bail hearing within sixty days after bail is denied, meaning when defendant is first held without bail, regardless of whether the trial court has made all of the requisite findings required by statute. State v. Downing, - Vt.
    - , 247 A.3d 150 (Nov. 2, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont law entitles a defendant held without bail on charges for a violent felony to a trial within sixty days. The ability of the court to commence trial within sixty days, however, is not a condition precedent to ordering pretrial detention; instead, the sixty-day rule serves as a limitation on the length of time that the defendant can be detained before trial, a result compelled by the text, structure, and purpose of the constitutional provision and corresponding statutes. State v. Downing, - Vt.

        The writ of habeas corpus is not to be given effect as an appeal to correct errors and irregularities in the trial procedure. In re Rickert, 124 Vt. 232, 203 A.2d 602 (1964), cert. denied, 379 U.S. 977, 85 S. Ct. 678, 13 L. Ed. 2d 568 (1965).

        That this section and section 43 of this chapter mentioned State's Attorneys when they provided date for their election and the terms to be served did not make the powers and prerogatives of a State's Attorneys constitutional functions that could not be taken away except by constitutional amendment, for the powers of State's Attorneys are set forth in the statutes, not the Constitution.

       <p>
        This section represents a denial of a right to a citizen, and if it cannot be clearly demonstrated that he falls within its proscription, or equally plainly shown that he is in violation of its purpose, he is entitled to be held free of its prohibition. Baker v. Hazen, 133 Vt. 433, 341 A.2d 707 (1975).

         2. Eligibility for office.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The words "eligible to any appointment" in this section are to be construed as having reference to the qualification to hold office, and not to the choosing or election to office, and the disqualification must exist at the time the term of office begins. State ex rel. Perkins v. Edwards, 99 Vt. 1, 130 A. 276 (1925); State v. Levy, 113 Vt. 374, 34 A.2d 370 (1943).
       </p>
       <p>
        A person holding an office under the authority of Congress may be eligible for, or may be elected to, an executive or judicial office, but, in such case, if he accepts the office under the authority of the State, he must abandon the one held under the authority of Congress, and if he continues to hold the latter, he cannot, consistently with this section, hold the former. McGregor v. Balch, 14 Vt. 428 (1842); State ex rel. Perkins v. Edwards, 99 Vt. 1, 130 A. 276 (1925).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        A judicial officer holding an office of profit or trust under the authority of Congress is to be considered as an officer de facto in a suit between third persons to which he is not a party, and his eligibility to exercise judicial office cannot be tried in such a suit.

       <p>
        The bar of second sentence of this section applies only to members of the Legislature and those holding executive or judicial office. 1960-62 Op. Atty. Gen. 46.
       </p>
       <p>
        Members of Board of Social Welfare exercise executive and judicial functions to such an extent that they are executive or judiciary officers within meaning of this section and, consequently, should not hold such office while simultaneously holding an office of profit or trust under the United States government. 1952-54 Op. Atty. Gen. 338.
       </p>
       <p>
        If an elective town office requires the performance of duties both executive and judicial in character, a person holding an office of profit or trust under the authority of Congress would be ineligible to hold such office. 1938-40 Op. Atty. Gen. 368.
       </p>
       <p>
        The office of school director requires performance of duties both executive and judicial in character and, therefore, falls within this section. State ex rel. Perkins v. Edwards, 99 Vt. 1, 130 A. 276, 1938-40 Op. Atty. Gen. 202 (1925).

       <p>
        The prohibitions on persons holding incompatible offices, set forth under this section, do not prevent one person from being a candidate for both the House of Representatives and the Senate at the same time, but if elected to both positions, such person would have to resign one position since under this section, he clearly cannot hold both positions at the same time. 1964-66 Op. Atty. Gen. 182.
       </p>
       <p>
        The position of Secretary of the Vermont Senate is not an appointment in the Legislature under this section, since the Secretary is not a member of the Legislature, but merely acts in a ministerial capacity under legislative leadership. 1960-62 Op. Atty. Gen. 46.

        A member of the International Joint Commission holds an office of profit or trust under the Congress of the United States and the Chair of the State Water Resources Board holds an executive office under this State; therefore, no person may hold both offices, as they are incompatible under the provisions of this section. 1968-70 Op.

       <p>
        Federal customs inspector holds an office under authority of Congress within meaning of this section and hence is ineligible for appointment to Board of Trustees of Vermont State Colleges, an executive office under this State. 1962-64 Op. Atty. Gen. 119.

       <p>
        Vermont's judicial resign-to-run provision and its constitutional provision pertaining to incompatible offices are not in conflict, and the Judicial Conduct Code can provide a more exacting restriction for judges than is provided in the Constitution. In re Hodgdon, 189 Vt. 265, 19 A.3d 598 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        One who holds an office of profit or trust under authority of Congress is, under this section, ineligible to appointment as city grand juror, this being a judiciary office. State v. Levy, 113 Vt. 374, 34 A.2d 370 (1943).

       <p>
        Person who is an employee and not an officer of State is not within provision of this section that person holding any office of profit or trust under authority of Congress is not eligible to any appointment in legislature, or to any executive or judiciary office under State. 1940-42 Op.

        This section did not make the office of postmaster incompatible with that of selectboard member where, due to creation of United States Postal Service as a semi-autonomous operation independent of Congress operating under the Executive Branch and not directly funded by the United States Treasury, there had been a strong dilution of the status of the position as an office under the authority of Congress and where there was uncertainty as to the mischief sought to be prevented by this section.

        Where successful candidate for House of Representatives was validly seated and serving as a member of the House of Representatives, he was entitled to salary established for the office, and injunction against payment of those earnings would be denied despite contention that campaign promise of candidate that he would set aside his salary when elected and divide it equally among fire departments and rescue squads in his voting district violated this section.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        A constable is in authority under the town in which he is elected, and so need not subscribe the oath of office required by this section of "officers in authority under this state." Bixby v. Roscoe, 85 Vt. 105, 81 A. 255 (1911).
       </p>
       <p>
        The requirement to take and subscribe the oath of office does not apply to such officers as derive their authority to act from towns and other municipal bodies, but only to such officers, judicial, executive, and military, as are strictly State officers; to wit, such as derive their authority to act from the votes of the freemen of the State at large, and such as are either elected or declared to be elected by the Legislature or appointed by the Governor. Rowell v. Horton, 58 Vt. 1, 3 A. 906 (1886).

       <p>
        Judgment against petitioner would not be vacated on ground that there was no showing that special prosecutor received and subscribed to oath prescribed in this section, since there is a presumption that executive authority was properly conferred and legally exercised, and petitioner failed to establish that there was any deficiency in this respect.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        An infirmity in qualifications of an officer commissioned to perform a public trust does not affect court's jurisdiction, so that had special prosecutor failed to take oath prescribed in this section his standing as a de facto officer would furnish ample authority to sustain petitioner's conviction. In re Dusablon, 126 Vt. 362, 230 A.2d 797 (1967).

       <p>
        Sureties upon official bond of person who served as an officer would not be discharged from liability on the bond in consequence of that person's neglect to take the required oaths, since the acts of that person, as an officer de facto, were valid so far as they concerned the rights of third persons, to the same extent that they would have been if he had been an officer de jure.

        Whenever an officer sues or is sued, and justifies his acts as done in his official capacity, he must show compliance with all requirements of the law necessary to constitute him a legally qualified officer, or an officer de jure, including the requirement of taking the official oath.

      As all persons of full age, to preserve their independence (if without a sufficient estate) ought to have some profession, calling, trade, or farm, whereby they may honestly subsist, there can be no necessity for, nor use in, establishing offices of profit, the usual effects of which are dependence and servility, unbecoming free citizens, in the possessors or expectants, and faction, contention and discord among the people. But if any person is called into public service to the prejudice of that person's private affairs, the person has a right to a reasonable compensation; and whenever an office through increase of fees or otherwise, becomes so profitable as to occasion many to apply for it, the profit ought to be lessened by the Legislature. And if any officer shall wittingly and wilfully, take greater fees than the law allows, it shall ever after disqualify that person from holding any office in this State until the person shall be restored by act of legislation.

        By attaching "boatable waters" and "lands not enclosed" limitations on the respective rights of fishing and hunting, this section has designated those points beyond which private property becomes inviolate for fishing and hunting purposes - nonboatability for the former and enclosure for the latter.

        Poll tax provisions have nothing to do with the proper regulation of hunting and fishing and therefore may not be used to restrict constitutional rights of residents in this regard. 1960-62 Op. Atty. Gen. 68.

       <p>
        The right guaranteed by this section as to boatable waters is limited to fishing, not hunting. 1970-72 Op. Atty. Gen. 191.

        No right can be acquired by or granted to private persons to control by artificial means for private purposes the height of the water of a lake which is boatable or the outflow therefrom. In re Lake Seymour, 117 Vt. 367, 91 A.2d 813 (1952).

        The bed or soil of boatable water is held by people of the State in their sovereign capacity in trust for public uses for which it is adapted and State is required to preserve water for common use of all. In re Lake Seymour, 117 Vt. 367, 91 A.2d 813 (1952).

       <p>
        Order of State Board of Health, prohibiting boating on pond, "boatable" within meaning of this section, and constituting source of city's water supply, is presumptively valid, and must be enforced unless it is made manifest that it has no just relation to protection of public health, or that it is plain invasion of constitutional rights.

        Lake Morey, covering an area of 640 acres, being extensively used for boating with rowboats, canoes, motor boats, and a steamer, and having boathouses, retaining walls and structures on its shores for use in getting into and out of boats, is boatable, as matter of law, and is public waters within this section.

       </p>
       <p>
        Term boatable waters as used in this section means waters navigable in fact, that is, capable from their situation and in their ordinary condition of being used by public as a means of passage or transportation. New England Trout & Salmon Club v. Mather, 68 Vt. 338, 35 A. 323 (1895).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Protections of the Vermont Constitution for hunting, trapping, and fishing, and the associated implementing statutes, do not diminish a landowner's expectation of privacy against warrantless intrusion and do not require a reframing or exception to the framework established in Kirchoff, in which the Court held that Article 11 protected against warrantless searches of "open fields" when the landowner objectively demonstrated his or her intent for privacy. State v. Dupuis, 208 Vt. 196, 197 A.3d 343 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        A landowner who encloses his land by posting signs in accordance with 10 V.S.A.
        §
        5201 has an exclusive right to the wild game found and taken thereon, subject to the regulatory authority of the State. 1970-72 Op. Atty. Gen. 191.
       </p>
       <p>
        Any person who trespasses on the enclosed land of another, without his consent, even to reach public waters for the purpose of fishing, would be liable for such damage as might be proved. 1930-32 Op. Atty. Gen. 300.
       </p>
       <p>
        By common law, fish, being ferae naturae, are the general property of people of the State in their united sovereignty, and owner of soil through which flows a nonboatable stream of water containing fish has only exclusive right of fishing therein within boundaries of his own territory; fish in the stream are not his and his right of property attaches only to the fish that he reduces to his actual possession, and he has no right to kill, or materially injure, or obstruct the free passage of, those he does not take. State v. Haskell, 84 Vt. 429, 79 A. 852 (1911).
       </p>
       <p>
        During closed season an inhabitant of this State has no property in a wild deer on his enclosed land, which is there being attacked and worried by another's duly licensed, registered and collared dog, as entitles him to kill the dog, though that be necessary to save the deer's life. Zanotti v. Bolles, 80 Vt. 345, 67 A. 818 (1907).
       </p>
       <p>
        While one has an exclusive right to fish in waters, not boatable, flowing through his land, and this right is private property and he may maintain trespass against any one who enters upon his land to fish without his license, riparian owners above and below are entitled to have stream remain a passageway for fish, and State may regulate time and manner in which his right of fishing shall be exercised so as to subserve common good. State v. Theriault, 70 Vt. 617, 41 A. 1030 (1898).
       </p>
       <p>
        It cannot be said as matter of law that public has the right of fishing in pond, not reserved in grant of town, as against owners of soil underneath and around it. New England Trout & Salmon Club v. Mather, 68 Vt. 338, 35 A. 323 (1895).

        Drafters of Vermont Constitution did not authorize public financing of religious education in Chapter II,
        §
        68; specification in that section that such education be "encouraged and protected" did not extend to public financing, in light of prohibition contained in Compelled Support Clause of Chapter I, Article 3.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The current system for funding public education in Vermont is in violation of the State Constitution. A legitimate governmental purpose cannot be fathomed to justify the gross inequities in educational opportunities produced by this system, with its substantial dependence on local property taxes and resultant wide disparities in revenues available to local school districts. The distribution of a resource as precious as educational opportunity may not have as its determining force the mere fortuity of a child's residence. Brigham v. State, 166 Vt. 246, 692 A.2d 384 (1997), (decided under facts existing before 1997 amendments to Title 16).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the State Constitution does not require exact equality of funding among school districts or prohibit minor disparities attributable to unavoidable local differences, it does prohibit substantial interdistrict funding disparities. Moreover, discrimination in the distribution of a constitutionally mandated right such as education may not be excused merely because a "minimal" or "adequate" level of opportunity is provided to all. The Legislature should act under the Vermont Constitution to make educational opportunity available on substantially equal terms, the specific means of discharging this broadly defined duty being properly left to its discretion. Brigham v. State, 166 Vt. 246, 692 A.2d 384 (1997), (decided under facts existing before 1997 amendments to Title 16).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section imposes on the General Assembly a duty in regard to education that is universally accepted as a proper public purpose. Vermont Educational Buildings Financing Agency v. Mann, 127 Vt. 262, 247 A.2d 68 (1968), appeal dismissed, 396 U.S. 801, 90 S. Ct. 9, 24 L. Ed. 2d 58 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Purpose of act creating Educational Buildings Financing Agency to promote the welfare of the people of the State was a public purpose within this section. Vermont Educational Buildings Financing Agency v. Mann, 127 Vt. 262, 247 A.2d 68 (1968), appeal dismissed, 396 U.S. 801, 90 S. Ct. 9, 24 L. Ed. 2d 58 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is within the authority of the Legislature under this section to implement the association of units of local government for the purpose of jointly operating school facilities. Dresden School District v. Norwich Town School District, 124 Vt. 227, 203 A.2d 598 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not a violation of this section to educate the youth of one town in a school located elsewhere, but such an arrangement must be entered into according to methods prescribed by the Legislature. 1956-58 Op. Atty. Gen. 101.
       </p>
       <p>
        If the school directors believe that a program of released time for religious instruction or worship is to be desired, and such program does not otherwise conflict with the required curricula, such a program not only would be legal, but probably something in the nature of encouragement to religious practices as was expressly contemplated in the language of this section. 1954-56 Op. Atty. Gen. 95.

        State Board of Education's implementation of Act 46, regarding the involuntary merger of school districts, did not violate the Education Clause. Act 46 explicitly states the Legislature's intent to consolidate school districts, not to close schools - and, in fact, it did not close any schools; plaintiffs' concern over potential future school closings was purely speculative and could not at this juncture be a basis for challenging Act 46 or the Board's implementation of the act.

      At the biennial session of the General Assembly of this State which convenes in A.D. 1975, and at the biennial session convening every fourth year thereafter, the Senate by a vote of two-thirds of its members, may propose amendments to this Constitution, with the concurrence of a majority of the members of the House of Representatives with the amendment as proposed by the Senate. A proposed amendment so adopted by the Senate and concurred in by the House of Representatives shall be referred to the next biennial session of the General Assembly; and if at that last session a majority of the members of the Senate and a majority of the House of Representatives concur in the proposed amendment, it shall be the duty of the General Assembly to submit the proposal directly to the voters of the state. Any proposed amendment submitted to the voters of the state in accordance with this section which is approved by a majority of the voters voting thereon shall become part of the Constitution of this State.
     </p>
     <p>
      Prior to the submission of a proposed amendment to a vote in accordance with this section, public notice of the proposed amendment shall be given by proclamation of the Governor.
     </p>
     <p>
      The General Assembly shall provide for the manner of voting on amendments proposed under this section, and shall enact legislation to carry the provisions of this section into effect.

The General Assembly may provide for establishment of a legislative apportionment board to advise and assist the General Assembly concerning legislative apportionment. If the General Assembly fails to revise the legislative districts as required in this section, the Supreme Court in appropriate legal proceedings brought for that purpose may order reapportionment of the districts.

       <p>
        In reviewing specific violations claimed by petitioners challenging the reapportionment of voting districts, the redistricting plan must be considered as a whole, taking into account the statewide implications. In re Reapportionment of Towns of Woodbury and Worcester, 177 Vt. 556, 861 A.2d 1117 (mem.) (September 13, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a redistricting plan is consistent with the fundamental constitutional requirement that districts be drawn to afford equality of representation, the Supreme Court will return it to the Legislature only when there is no rational or legitimate basis for any deviations from other constitutional or statutory criteria. In re Reapportionment of Town of Hartland, 160 Vt. 9, 624 A.2d 323 (1993).

        To make a prima facie case, petitioners challenging the reapportionment of voting districts must show that the State has failed to meet constitutional or statutory standards or policies with regard to a specific part of the plan; only then does the burden shift to the State, to show that satisfying those requirements was impossible because of the impermissible effect it would have had on other districts.
