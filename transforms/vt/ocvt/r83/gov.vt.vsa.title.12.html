      <p>
       The Supreme Court is empowered to prescribe and amend from time to time general rules with respect to pleadings, practice, evidence, procedure, and forms for all actions and proceedings in all courts of this State. The rules thus prescribed or amended shall not abridge, enlarge, or modify any substantive rights of any person provided by law. The rules when initially prescribed or any amendments thereto, including any repeal, modification, or addition, shall take effect on the date provided by the Supreme Court in its order of promulgation, unless objected to by the Legislative Committee on Judicial Rules as provided by this chapter. If objection is made by the Legislative Committee on Judicial Rules, the initially prescribed rules in question shall not take effect until they have been reported to the General Assembly by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court at any regular, adjourned, or special session thereof, and until after the expiration of 45 legislative days of that session, including the date of the filing of the report. The General Assembly may repeal, revise, or modify any rule or amendment thereto, and its action shall not be abridged, enlarged, or modified by subsequent rule.

         Statute concerning the Legislative Committee on Judicial Rules imposes no requirement that the court create a public record of submission to the committee, let alone invalidity of the rules as a consequence for the failure to do so; thus, there was no merit to a bar applicant's argument that the 2019 rules governing admission to the bar were without force because the applicant found no record that they were either sent to the committee or reviewed by that committee. Had it wished, the legislature could have utilized the same language it used in the section of the statute requiring the Committee on Judicial Rules "give public notice" of any public hearing on a court rule.

       <p>
        Fact that writ returnable to county court was signed by justice of peace who was interested in event of suit was no ground of abatement. Graham v. Todd, 9 Vt. 166 (1837).
       </p>
       <p>
        Justice of peace had no authority to render judgment by confession if he was interested in demand on which judgment was rendered. Bates v. Thompson, 2 D. Chip. 96 (1824).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was good cause of challenge to petit juror, that he had been recognized for costs of prosecution in suit, though he had been discharged from his recognizance. Phelps v. Hall, 2 Tyl. 401 (1803), same case 2 Tyler 399.
       </p>
       <p>
        To work judicial disqualification, interest must be proprietary or such that affects personal rights of judge as an individual, and in absence of an express statutory prohibition, remote interest does not disqualify. Vermont Elec. Power Co. v. Anderson, 121 Vt. 72, 147 A.2d 875 (1959).

       <p>
        While in criminal cases, any justice of county had jurisdiction, though penalty or fine might go to treasury of town of which such justice was rated inhabitant, in civil cases, if any part of debt or avails of action went into town treasury, such justice did not have jurisdiction. Waters v. Day, 10 Vt. 487 (1838).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since justice of peace, acting under statutes relating to appraisal of damages from grading of a highway, was required to perform judicial functions, justice who was taxpayer of town concerned was disqualified from so acting on ground of interest. Fairbanks v. Rockingham, 72 Vt. 419, 48 A. 654 (1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        Allegation that justice was "lawful inhabitant and citizen of said town of B.," did not import that he was liable to pay taxes, and therefore interested in cause. Pierce v. Butler, 16 Vt. 101 (1844).
       </p>
       <p>
        Justice of peace who was rated inhabitant of town into treasury of which fine was to be paid had jurisdiction of cause. State v. Batchelder, 6 Vt. 479 (1834).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that one of grand jurors who presented bill of indictment against town for not making and opening road was rateable inhabitant of town was no cause why such indictment should be quashed. State v. Newfane, 12 Vt. 422 (1840).
       </p>
       <p>
        In action of debt on recognizance taken for appearance of person arrested on criminal process, it was no defense that jury who tried case were taken from town to which fine would be payable. Treasurer of Middletown v. Ames, 7 Vt. 166 (1835).

       <p>
        This section by implication prohibits judge of county court from accepting retainer or acting as attorney or counsel in bringing or managing in such court any suit in which he has no personal interest, during his term of office. Cady v. Lang, 95 Vt. 287, 115 A. 140 (1921).
       </p>
       <p>
        Judge of court of insolvency was not precluded from passing on claim consisting of judgment of common law court, by reason of fact that he acted as counsel for claimant in procuring that judgment; nor was he disqualified by reason of fact that judgment was partially secured by attachment, where it did not appear that he acted as counsel in respect to attachment or passed on its validity as judge. Clemons v. Clemons, 69 Vt. 545, 38 A. 314 (1897), same case 68 Vt. 77, 34 A. 34, 39 A.L.R. 459.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since authorization of indifferent person to serve citation upon party to be present at taking of deposition, was judicial act, such authorization by magistrate, who was counsel for one of parties, was invalid. St. Johnsbury v. Goodenough, 44 Vt. 662 (1871).
       </p>
       <p>
        When attorney made writ, signed it as justice of peace and took recognizance for costs, this was a judicial act which rendered process abatable. Ingraham v. Leland, 19 Vt. 304 (1847).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since there was no distinction between being "of counsel" and "attorney" in case, plea in abatement was sufficient if it alleged that magistrate who signed writ "was then and there an attorney of record in said suit." Ingraham v. Leland, 19 Vt. 304 (1847).
       </p>
       <p>
        Allegation that justice was "lawfully appointed agent of the town of B., to prosecute and defend suits in which said town was interested," was insufficient, on demurrer, to bring case within provision of statute which prohibits a justice from taking "cognizance of any cause, or doing any judicial act, when he shall have been of counsel." Pierce v. Butler, 16 Vt. 101 (1844).

       <p>
        Evidence and findings amply supported conclusion that claim that trial judge who as attorney general had, more than ten years previous, made an argument in a post-conviction proceeding brought by petitioner, and had had petitioner before him as a litigant at one time, and testified in federal court relating to prosecutions of petitioner, was biased and prejudiced against petitioner was unfounded by the evidence; and claim was unfounded in law as well. In re Shuttle, 131 Vt. 457, 306 A.2d 667 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Environmental board's initiation of action in superior court to enjoin violations of Act 250 permit and its continuation of hearing on petition to revoke the permit did not violate subsection (a) of this section, requiring disqualification of person acting in judicial capacity; mere combination of functions did not make board "interested" and therefore disqualified to act on petition for revocation. In re Crushed Rock, Inc., 150 Vt. 613, 557 A.2d 84 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that assistant judges of county court were members of prison board by which respondent was required to labor without jail walls, did not disqualify them to sit in trial of respondent for escape while so employed. State v. Wright, 81 Vt. 281, 69 A. 761 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        Justice of peace could issue warrant to collect tax which was to be paid to board of selectmen to which he belonged, issuance of warrant being merely ministerial and he having no personal or private interest in tax. Alger v. Curry, 40 Vt. 437 (1868), same case 38 Vt. 382.
       </p>
       <p>
        Justice of peace was not legally disqualified to take jurisdiction of and try case for reason that he has previously, as one of board of arbitrators between same parties and in reference to subject matter of suit, formed an opinion and expressed it to his associate arbitrator. Batchelder v. Nourse, 35 Vt. 642 (1863).
       </p>
       <p>
        Justice of peace who had acted as grand juror in prosecuting for an offense before justice of peace was incompetent to try a civil action brought to recover redress for supposed criminal act. Freelove v. Smith, 9 Vt. 180 (1837).

        If justice, who was interested, continued cause, and parties went to trial on merits without objection on account of improper continuance, irregularity in continuance was waived. Howe v. Hosford, 8 Vt. 220 (1836).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although juror had remained on panel by consent of parties, this did not preclude party from challenging him, on the ground of having been recognized for costs of prosecution, upon impaneling of another jury to try same issue. Phelps v. Hall, 2 Tyl. 401 (1803), same case 2 Tyl. 399.
       </p>
       <p>
        Objection on appeal that trial judge was interested in suit was not considered where record did not disclose fact that judge was interested. Weeks v. Sowles, 58 Vt. 696, 6 A. 603 (1886).

       <p>
        Because the statute regarding contempt in Superior Court was merely a procedural prerequisite to the institution of contempt proceedings, the prohibition against court rules imposing substantive changes of the law was inapplicable here. Welch v. Welch, 193 Vt. 385, 67 A.3d 956 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        A party cannot be subjected to contempt proceedings under this section until actual service has been accomplished. Socony Mobil Oil Co. v. Northern Oil Co., 126 Vt. 160, 225 A.2d 60 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        Contempt proceeding based on violation of court order does not open to reconsideration the legal or actual basis of the order so as to result in a retrial of the original controversy. Socony Mobil Oil Co. v. Northern Oil Co., 126 Vt. 160, 225 A.2d 60 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right of a party to be heard in defense of his rights cannot be withheld as a punishment for acts of contempt that did nothing to hinder or embarrass the proceedings or degrade the authority of the court. Walker v. Walker, 123 Vt. 430, 192 A.2d 460 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        The contemptuous conduct must, in some way, affect the due course of procedure to final decree; otherwise, it cannot be used to forbid the libellee, who is in court in response to its summons, the right to take part in a hearing which deprives him of the subject matter of the litigation. Walker v. Walker, 123 Vt. 430, 192 A.2d 460 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Contempt proceeding is taken in the original action. Macdermid v. Macdermid, 116 Vt. 237, 73 A.2d 315 (1950).

       </p>
       <p>
        Argument was rejected that contempt proceedings may be instituted only against party named in caption of case for violation of court order; this section does not impose a limit on the persons that a court could punish for contempt. Horton v. Chamberlain, 152 Vt. 351, 566 A.2d 953 (1989).

        A party to a divorce proceeding cannot be adjudged in contempt for an out-of-court failure to abide by a court order, without an order to show cause and an opportunity to be heard. Walker v. Walker, 123 Vt. 430, 192 A.2d 460 (1963).

        Where defendant had actual knowledge and notice of contempt petition and what was set forth in it he could not avail himself of fact that process was not served personally on him. Macdermid v. Macdermid, 116 Vt. 237, 73 A.2d 315 (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        Service of copy of contempt proceeding on attorney of record of defendant in case wherein order was made on which contempt petition was based was good and valid service on such defendant in contempt proceedings. Macdermid v. Macdermid, 116 Vt. 237, 73 A.2d 315 (1950).

       <p>
        Where relator was proceeded against for contempt, in disobedience of an order of chancellor upon showing of other party, and adjudication of chancellor was on this showing alone, without any attempt to give notice to person convicted, proceeding was irregular and such proceeding was regarded as a distinct and independent matter requiring distinct notice, as much as a new suit.

        In a divorce action abated by the death of husband, the Family Court correctly concluded that contempt provided no adequate remedy where husband removed wife as the beneficiary of a life insurance policy in violation of a pre-abatement order. Aither v. Estate of Aither, 180 Vt. 472, 913 A.2d 376 (November 9, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was properly held in contempt of order that he pay child support, even though there was no finding that he had the present ability to pay, as defendant, who did not dispute that he had failed to comply with the orders, had the burden of establishing inability to comply. The court held defendant in contempt, not because he had the present ability to pay the child support, but because he failed to establish an inability to comply with its orders. Russell v. Armitage, 166 Vt. 392, 697 A.2d 630 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        The inability, without fault, to render obedience to an order or decree of a court is a good defense to a charge of contempt, but such a defense is effective only where, after using due diligence, the person is still not able to comply with the order. Socony Mobil Oil Co. v. Northern Oil Co., 126 Vt. 160, 225 A.2d 60 (1966).
       </p>

        Defendant has burden of proving the impossibility of compliance with court order in contempt proceedings based on violation of such order. Socony Mobil Oil Co. v. Northern Oil Co., 126 Vt. 160, 225 A.2d 60 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        Absent a showing of due diligence on the part of the defendants to comply with the order of the court, trial court was not required to make determination of whether defendant was unable to obey decree by reason of plaintiff's failure to perform.

       <p>
        In the case of defendant, found in contempt of a judgment order incorporating a stipulation between defendant and the State, whereby defendant agreed to abate nuisance odors from its tannery, $10,000 fine imposed on defendant could not be upheld as a civil contempt penalty, where it was not compensatory in nature since the State introduced no evidence of any loss occasioned by defendant's failure to comply with the order, and where it was not a coercive fine since it was not purgeable.

        An indigent defendant is entitled, under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, to appointment of counsel prior to being incarcerated for civil contempt. Russell v. Armitage, 166 Vt. 392, 697 A.2d 630 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Civil contempt for failure to pay child support involves three issues: (1) The obligee must show that the obligor violated the court's child-support order; (2) The obligor then has the burden of showing an inability to comply; and (3) If the obligor fails to meet this burden, the court may find him in willful violation of the order and, in the final step, determine appropriate means by which to ensure compliance with the order. Where defendant was represented by counsel on all three issues at the purge hearing that ultimately resulted in an order of incarceration, due process did not require appointment of counsel at an earlier point in the proceeding. Russell v. Armitage, 166 Vt. 392, 697 A.2d 630 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the Public Defender Act, 13 V.S.A.
        ยงยง
        5201-5277, does not authorize courts to assign civil contempt proceedings to the Defender General even where the trial court considers ordering incarceration, nor does it authorize compensation of appointed counsel to be made from funds appropriated to the Office of the Defender General, the court has the inherent power to require attorneys to serve and protect the vital interests of uncounselled litigants where circumstances demand it. Public defenders, like all members of the bar, are subject to such appointment. Russell v. Armitage, 166 Vt. 392, 697 A.2d 630 (1997).

        Without question, the statute regarding contempt in Superior Court and the case law construing that statute require service of the underlying order upon a party before the party can be found in contempt for violating that order, but neither the statute nor the case law purports to designate the form of service required. Indeed, when the Legislature intends to do so, it makes the form of service explicit. Welch v. Welch, 193 Vt. 385, 67 A.3d 956 (2013).

         1. Construction and effect.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        With respect to a dispute between the parties regarding their real estate agreement, as the agreement was a valid contract for deed and not unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds, the purchasers acquired an equitable interest in the property. Prue v. Royer, 193 Vt. 267, 67 A.3d 895 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a grantor transferred real property to his then girlfriend, who transferred it to her son after the relationship ended, the statute of frauds did not prevent the grantor from presenting evidence of an alleged oral agreement that the girlfriend would reconvey the property to him. Such evidence could be used not to enforce the terms of the alleged agreement, but to support the grantor's assertion that the girlfriend and son were unjustly enriched and that he was entitled to the imposition of a constructive trust. Savage v. Walker, 185 Vt. 603, 969 A.2d 121 (mem.) (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        As a general rule, a contract involving the sale of land or interests therein must be in writing to be enforceable. Rappaport v. Estate of Banfield, 181 Vt. 447, 924 A.2d 72 (April 6, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        While partnership or joint venture agreements need not be in writing as a general matter, the fact that agreements covered by the Statute of Frauds - such as those relating to interests in real property - are made in the context of a partnership or joint venture agreement does not render the Statute inapplicable. The fact that the agreement involves parties to a business partnership does not negate the interests traditionally safeguarded under the Statute. Quimby v. Myers, 179 Vt. 611, 895 A.2d 128 (mem.) (November 9, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Statute of Frauds establishes a rule of evidence regarding parol testimony, and does not make oral contracts illegal or void per se. Troy v. Hanifin, 132 Vt. 76, 315 A.2d 875 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any changes made in contract governed by the provisions of Statute of Frauds are subject to the same requirements of form as the original provisions. Evarts v. Forte, 135 Vt. 306, 376 A.2d 766 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the Statute of Frauds is merely a rule of evidence, litigants who timely raise it are entitled to its enforcement. Pike Indus., Inc. v. Middlebury Associates, 136 Vt. 588, 398 A.2d 280 (1979), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 947, 102 S. Ct. 1446, 71 L. Ed. 2d 660 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a contract is governed by the Statute of Frauds, any changes made are subject to the same requirements of form as the original provisions. Kingsbury v. Villeneuve, 144 Vt. 648, 475 A.2d 241 (mem.) (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute of Frauds applies to executory contracts. Ide & Smith v. Stanton, 15 Vt. 685 (1843).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute of Frauds does not make oral contracts illegal or void and unenforceable if allowed to be proved by parol, but affects rules of evidence and not pleading. Taplin v. Hinckley Fibre Co., 97 Vt. 184, 122 A. 426 (1923); Scofield v. Stoddard, 58 Vt. 290, 5 A. 314 (1885); Montgomery v. Edwards, 46 Vt. 151 (1873); Adams v. Patrick, 30 Vt. 516 (1858).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute of Frauds does not interfere with substance of contract, but throws difficulty in way of evidence. Taplin v. Hinckley Fibre Co., 97 Vt. 184, 122 A. 426 (1923).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute of Frauds, which prohibits suit on certain contracts not in writing, does not make contract void, but so far as same may have been performed, party may defend under it as to what has been done. Philbrook v. Belknap, 6 Vt. 383 (1834); Mack v. Bragg, 30 Vt. 571 (1858).

         2. Modifications.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        With respect to a dispute between the parties regarding their real estate agreement and related financing agreements, it was clear that the modifications were intended to refer to and modify the earlier purchase agreement, such that there was no violation of the Statute of Frauds by the failure to include a closing date therein. Prue v. Royer, 193 Vt. 267, 67 A.3d 895 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although, generally, changes in contracts covered by this section are governed by the same formal requirements as the original contract, where the parties waive, by their words and conduct, the time limitations of the contract, the nonwritten modification does not violate this section since waiver and estoppel operate independently of it. North v. Simonini, 142 Vt. 482, 457 A.2d 285 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        An oral modification of a written contract is unenforceable under the Statute of Frauds. Kingsbury v. Villeneuve, 144 Vt. 648, 475 A.2d 241 (mem.) (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any proposed changes or modifications in a contract controlled by this section are subjected to the same requirements of form as the original provisions. Chomicky v. Buttolph, 147 Vt. 128, 513 A.2d 1174 (1986).

         3. Purpose.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The purpose of this section is to prevent a party from being compelled, by oral and perhaps false testimony, to be held responsible for an agreement he or she claims was never made. Mason v. Anderson, 146 Vt. 242, 499 A.2d 783 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the writing requirement of this section is imposed primarily as a shield against possible fraud, it also promotes deliberation, seriousness, certainty, and shows that the act was a genuine act of volition. Chomicky v. Buttolph, 147 Vt. 128, 513 A.2d 1174 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Purpose of Statute of Frauds is to prevent party from being compelled, by oral and perhaps false testimony, to be held responsible for contract he claims he never made. First Nat'l Bank v. Laperle, 117 Vt. 144, 86 A.2d 635 (1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        If, however, that party has offered in writing to make very contract with which it is sought to charge him, he cannot justly complain because acceptance of other party is oral. First Nat'l Bank v. Laperle, 117 Vt. 144, 86 A.2d 635 (1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        Provisions of Statute of Frauds applicable to contracts affecting interests in land were adopted for purpose of preventing existing estates in land from being upset by parol evidence, and their general effect is to require all contracts concerning real estate to be in writing. Couture v. Lowery, 122 Vt. 239, 168 A.2d 295 (1961).

         4. Estoppel.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where an agreement for purchase and sale of real estate provided that the sale was contingent on buyer having seen the placement of utility lines, but buyer was required to notify owner of her intention to proceed with the sale 14 days after the lines had been installed and owner's real estate broker orally agreed to several time extensions for buyer to inspect the lines, the owner was estopped from asserting a continuing right in the buyer to cancel the contract. North v. Simonini, 142 Vt. 482, 457 A.2d 285 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        In action to recover for labor with team, plaintiff's contention that defendant was estopped from setting up Statute of Frauds as defense by reason of having represented to plaintiff that he could pay by team work for certain wagon sold him by defendant, was untenable, where contract on which recovery was sought was admittedly oral, and there was no testimony tending to show that purchase of wagon had any connection with it, or was an acknowledgement of it. Taplin v. Hinckley Fibre Co., 97 Vt. 184, 122 A. 426 (1923).

         5. Reliance on oral promise.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        An oral agreement may be removed from the Statute of Frauds if the proponent can show that, in reliance on the agreement, he or she suffered a substantial and irretrievable change in position. Quenneville v. Buttolph, 175 Vt. 444, 833 A.2d 1263 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute of Frauds did not bar enforcement of general contractor's oral agreement to deed water line to town without payment, since town's performance of its part of bargain - permitting general contractor to install ten-inch water main under town road - altered positions of parties and thus enforcement of agreement was needed to prevent injustice. Town of Rutland v. City of Rutland, 170 Vt. 87, 743 A.2d 585 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a party relies on an oral promise, fully performing its end of the bargain, then a written promise is not required if it would be fraud to allow the promisor to deny the contract. Contractor's Crane Service, Inc. v. Vermont Whey Abatement Authority, 147 Vt. 441, 519 A.2d 1166 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        The law does not require that a party seeking to enforce an oral promise prove fraud; rather, he must show that acts of his, done in reliance on the agreement, known to the defendant, so altered the relations of the parties as to prevent restoration to their former condition. Contractor's Crane Service, Inc. v. Vermont Whey Abatement Authority, 147 Vt. 441, 519 A.2d 1166 (1986).

         6. Memorandum
        </b>
        .
       </h5>
       <p>
        Affidavit by the sole member of a limited liability company taken in a federal court proceeding was not a repudiation of an existing contract, or an assertion that it was not binding because not in writing, but rather a denial that a contract was ever formed. As such, it did not provide the unambiguous recognition of the contract that was required to satisfy the Statute of Frauds. Stonewall of Woodstock Corp. v. Stardust 11TS, LLC, 208 Vt. 97, 195 A.3d 1111 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        E-mails from the attorney for the sole member of a limited liability company (LLC) could not supply the signed writing required by the Statute of Frauds because the attorney was not authorized in writing to conclude the real estate sale on behalf of the member or the LLC. Stonewall of Woodstock Corp. v. Stardust 11TS, LLC, 208 Vt. 97, 195 A.3d 1111 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        A written offer that is orally accepted may constitute a sufficient memorandum of the contract under this section provided the offeror is the party to be charged. Benya v. Stevens & Thompson Paper Co., 143 Vt. 521, 468 A.2d 929 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        To comply with statute, written memorandum must either by its own language or by reference to something else, contain such description of contract actually made as obviates necessity of resorting to oral evidence in order to supply any terms of contract essential to its validity. Theberge v. Canadian Pac. Ry., 119 Vt. 193, 122 A.2d 848 (1956); Taplin v. Hinckley Fibre Co., 97 Vt. 184, 122 A. 426 (1923).
       </p>
       <p>
        If any of these essential terms are altered by contact not in writing, entire contract is thereby reduced to grade of mere unwritten contract, upon which statute expressly declares that no action shall be maintained. Theberge v. Canadian Pac. Ry., 119 Vt. 193, 122 A.2d 848 (1956); Dana & Henry v. Hancock, 30 Vt. 616 (1858).
       </p>
       <p>
        Written offer accepted by parol may constitute sufficient memorandum of contract to satisfy statute, provided person making offer is party to be charged. First Nat'l Bank v. Laperle, 117 Vt. 144, 86 A.2d 635 (1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        An exception in deed of land by vendor to third person, of timber upon it, which he had previously sold to vendee, was not such a memorandum of contract, as was required by statute, to make it valid as contract. Buck v. Pickwell, 27 Vt. 157 (1854).

         *7. Price.
        </b>
       </h5>

        Although price is an essential term of a bargain of sale and must be stated in memorandum thereof, this is so only when parties agree on price, and if they leave price unfixed, law steps in and fixes it at reasonable figure, memorandum required by statute need not state price, and parol evidence is admissible to determine it.

        Although verbal contract, in part for sale of land and inseparable, was within statute, such statute affected only remedy, and as vendors were not obliged to avail themselves of benefit of its protection to avoid their undertaking, if they chose to recognize contract without claiming such protection, it was good against them.

        Failure to expressly claim benefit of statute not only amounted to renunciation of such benefit, but effect was permanent, and not confined to existing issues; and thus where party in original suit failed to claim in explicit language benefit of statute, he could not set up statute as defense to cross-bill.

        Debtor cannot rely on parol agreement of another to pay his debt, such agreement being within statute, but he must show in addition an actual substitution of third person for himself by an arrangement of all parties, or an actual compliance with terms of agreement; willingness to pay as agreed by third person, and to receive the same of him by the creditor, is not sufficient.

        Issue of whether a special promise to answer for the debt, default or misdoings of another is original and not under the Statute of Frauds, or whether it is collateral, is usually a factual issue, and the new promise is original if it contemplates a discharge of the first contracting party and substitution of the party involved in the new contract. Pike Indus., Inc. v. Middlebury Associates, 136 Vt. 588, 398 A.2d 280 (1979), cert. denied, 455 U.S. 947, 102 S. Ct. 1446, 71 L. Ed. 2d 660 (1982).

        This section applies to, inter alia, a special promise to answer for the debt, default or misdoings of another; an original promise, however, is unaffected by this section, and thus can be oral.

        Oral assurances by producers to pay debts of joint venture formed by them to operate cheese processing plant was an "original promise" unaffected by this section when such oral assurances enabled producers to continue legally disposing of whey after joint venture breached its agreement with hauler.

       </p>
       <p>
        An original promise to answer for the debt of another is enforceable because it is supported by new consideration, that is the promise must benefit or operate as an advantage to the party making it; a collateral promise is unenforceable because it is simply gratuitous. Lussier v. Stevens, 153 Vt. 362, 571 A.2d 666 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        If oral promise is original, Statute of Frauds does not prevent recovery, but if collateral, statute is bar. Enos v.

       <p>
        When by accession and agreement of all parties interested, original or intermediate debt is extinguished, promise to pay amount thereof to third party is not promise to answer for debt of another within statute, as no such debt exists, it being new, original, and independent engagement, founded on merger and extinguishment of pre-existing debt or demand.

        Where plaintiff claimed to recover payment from defendant for services rendered third person, and it appeared, that defendant, previous to rendition of services, promised to be responsible for the amount, and plaintiff supposed he was working for defendant, and charged his services to defendant, undertaking of defendant was original, and not collateral, and he was liable to plaintiff for amount of his account.

        In determining whether a subsequent oral promise to pay a debt constitutes an original contract unaffected by this section, rather than a collateral promise to an original contract unenforceable under subdivision (2) of this section, court must look to see if there was new consideration to support the agreement; if new consideration exists, the contract is considered an original agreement.

       <p>
        Where corporation agreed to pay plaintiff a finder's fee for locating a bank which the corporation could purchase, and the corporation's sole stockholder orally promised to pay plaintiff's fee if the corporation did not, stockholder's promise constituted a collateral promise to the original contract, unenforceable under subdivision (2) of this section, rather than an original contract, since it would not benefit the stockholder in any way that was not already established by the original contract.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where oral promise is original, based on valuable consideration between promisor and promisee, and not collateral to original debt, case is not within statute, provided it affirmatively appears that consideration is one which operates to advantage of promisor. Johnson v. Samson Est. (1942) 113 Vt. 38, 29 A.2d 919, 144 A.L.R. 1106.
       </p>
       <p>
        Promise to pay debt of another is not within statute and need not be in writing, if it is based upon valuable consideration independent of original debt, moving between the parties to new promise, or even from original debtor to promissor; and when such consideration exists, it makes no difference in regard to application of statute, whether original debtor remains liable or not. Cross v. Richardson, 30 Vt. 641 (1858); Wait v. Ex'r of Wait, 28 Vt. 350 (1856); French v. Thompson, 6 Vt. 54 (1834).

        If promise of indemnity is not collateral to liability of some other person to same party to whom promise is made, it is not within statute, and in absence of all evidence that there was liability of any other person to plaintiff, to which defendant's promise of indemnity could have been collateral, it must be treated as an original promise.

        Where verbal contract is to be performed within year by one party, but not by other, question whether statute applies or not depends on whether suit is brought against party who was to perform his part within year, and if it is so brought, statute would not apply, but if brought against party whose agreement was not to be performed within year, then statute would be bar.

        Nature of the undertaking governs applicability of the Statute of Frauds, not the capacity to comply, so that where, by its terms, oral promise could be performed within one year, promisor's argument that due to his strained financial position he was not capable of performing within a year was to no avail.

        Where it was orally promised that loan made in May, 1969, would be repaid either in January of 1970, or upon receipt of borrower's tax refund for the taxable year 1969, either alternative was sufficient to take promise out of the Statute of Frauds, as by its terms the agreement was capable of being performed within one year.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where money was loaned for a "long period of time," the repayment could have been within a year and the Statute of Frauds did not apply; and that the time of performance was uncertain or could have extended beyond a year did not make the statute applicable.

       <p>
        Oral agreement which, according to intention of parties, as shown by terms of contract, may be fully performed within a year from the time it is made, is not within statute, although time of its performance is uncertain, and may probably extend, and be expected by parties to extend beyond year; and this rule applies to a particular contract although in fact performance is not had within the year.

        Statute is good defense to an executory contract for sale of lands owned by husband and wife where contract was signed by husband alone and without proper authorization from wife. Hathaway v. Fernandez, 117 Vt. 234, 89 A.2d 117 (1952).

       <p>
        When landowners' attorney in fact told purchasers that he had no legal right to convey owners' land to them but that he would try to make it as legal as possible under power of attorney in fact and purchasers had common intention of making out a deed that would create an illusion of title so that purchasers might finance house trailer which they wished to place on the lot, it was inappropriate to give weight to considerations of reliance and prejudice in favor of purchasers who moved onto the land and made certain improvements. Campbell v. Blair & Campbell, 127 Vt. 157, 241 A.2d 791 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under statute, if wife was to be held as a joint contractor on executory contract for sale of real estate, she must have signed contract, either by her own hand or by agent duly authorized in writing, and she was not bound by such contract to which her husband signed her name in absence of proof that he had written authority so to do.

        Written ratification of authority to execute contract need not be formal document, nor addressed or delivered to other party to contract, but is sufficient to satisfy statute if it recognizes existence of contract and either expressly or impliedly approves it.

        Unauthorized sale by landowners' attorney in fact of interest in owners' land under power of attorney given by owners for limited purpose not including such a sale was invalid under this section in absence of any pleading or proof of an oral or written ratification of the sale by owners, and thus owners could not be held to have waived any objection to the purported sale.

Vermont Marble Co. v. Eastman, 91 Vt. 425, 101 A. 151 (1915).

        An exception to the rule that a contract involving the sale of land or interests therein must be in writing exists where a party demonstrates that he or she is equitably entitled to the claimed interest in land. In such cases, enforcement is justified on the ground that repudiation by one party after the other has fully performed amounts to a virtual fraud. Rappaport v. Estate of Banfield, 181 Vt. 447, 924 A.2d 72 (April 6, 2007).

       <p>
        Where defendant sold and delivered stoves to orator, for which orator paid him thousand dollars in money, and executed and tendered to him a deed of certain land that defendant agreed to, but would not take in payment of balance, contract was fulfilled and performed by orator, and nothing was left open for Statute of Frauds to operate upon. Adams v. Smilie, 50 Vt. 1 (1877).

        In an action on contract for sale of certain standing timber, writing signed by plaintiff but not by defendants, whereby he sold them timber and gave them six months in which to remove it and under which they entered upon land and cut all timber involved in suit and removed some and left the rest, was admissible, as against statute, since defendants by entering and acting under writing adopted it and became bound by it as if they had signed it. Ross v. Hamilton, 95 Vt. 234, 113 A. 781 (1921).

       <p>
        To fall within the exception to the rule that a contract involving the sale of land or interests therein must be in writing, it was necessary for plaintiff to show that: (1) there was an oral agreement (2) upon which he reasonably relied (3) by changing his position so that he could not be returned to his former position, and (4) the other party knew of such reliance. Rappaport v. Estate of Banfield, 181 Vt. 447, 924 A.2d 72 (April 6, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff who had acquired a deeded right of first refusal to purchase a lot owned by defendants failed to show that there was a separate and distinct oral agreement regarding the right of first refusal, that he made a substantial and irretrievable change in position in reliance on the agreement, or that he fully performed any obligations under the alleged agreement, and the undisputed evidence, viewed in plaintiff's favor, was that both plaintiff and defendants misunderstood the terms of plaintiff's deed, the trial court properly found enforcement of plaintiff's claimed oral agreement barred by the Statute of Frauds. Rappaport v. Estate of Banfield, 181 Vt. 447, 924 A.2d 72 (April 6, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there is an oral contract for the sale of land, a purchasing party who is in possession of the land and who makes substantial improvements to the property is entitled to specific performance of the agreement, and this may take the oral contract out of the Statute of Frauds. Quenneville v. Buttolph, 175 Vt. 444, 833 A.2d 1263 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Money payments or actions that are indistinguishable from those of a tenant responsible for the maintenance of the leased premises are not sufficient to remove the agreement from the requirements in the Statute of Frauds. Quenneville v. Buttolph, 175 Vt. 444, 833 A.2d 1263 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where vendor and vendee entered into an oral purchase agreement which provided that upon payment of entire purchase price a deed conveying summer camp was to be given to vendee, and thereafter vendee made down payment and was given possession of premises by vendor, it could not be said that possession of this type of property coupled with a fractional payment of the purchase price was such part performance as would take the oral contract out of the Statute of Frauds, nor was there any proof or finding of the elements essential to the intervention of a court of equity. Troy v. Hanifin, 132 Vt. 76, 315 A.2d 875 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where facts supported lower court's determination that activities of proposed purchased under oral contract for sale of land, in making improvements on the premises, were entirely assignable to his situation as licensee, there was no part performance removing the contract from the Statute of Frauds. Bell v. Town of Grafton, 133 Vt. 1, 328 A.2d 408 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Validation of oral contract to convey real estate, in spite of prohibition against enforcement found in Statute of Frauds, depends on doctrine of part performance and since real issue is change of position by party claiming relief in reliance on the oral agreement to such a measure that parties cannot be restored to reasonable equivalence to their former condition, it is a requirement that reliance be something beyond injury adequately compensable in money. Jasmin v. Alberico, 135 Vt. 287, 376 A.2d 32 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although oral contract to convey real estate may be taken out of Statute of Frauds by party in possession having made substantial improvements, such improvements to property as repairing back porch, having gas piped to house, making electrical and plumbing repairs, doing some landscaping and installing two stoves for heating purposes were indistinguishable from activities of a tenant responsible for maintenance of leased premises and simply did not meet the test of a substantial and irretrievable change of position set out in the case law. Jasmin v. Alberico, 135 Vt. 287, 376 A.2d 32 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Such performance under an oral contract as will make it a fraud to apply the prohibition of this section supports equitable relief and makes the contract enforceable; and party seeking enforcement of the contract need not show he has been defrauded, but rather, that his acts in reliance upon the agreement, known to the other party to the agreement, so altered the relations of the parties as to prevent restoration to their former condition. Nichols v. Nichols, 139 Vt. 273, 427 A.2d 374 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, for many years, son and his wife fully performed their part of oral contract whereby mother agreed to convey to them the family farm if, during the remainder of her life, they would operate the farm and care for her, there was such performance under the oral contract as would make it a fraud to apply the prohibition of this section. Nichols v. Nichols, 139 Vt. 273, 427 A.2d 374 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that plaintiffs made financing arrangements and conducted a title search did not make the doctrine of part performance applicable in an action for specific performance of an alleged oral agreement for the sale of land where defendants sets up subdivision (5) of this section as a defense. Chomicky v. Buttolph, 147 Vt. 128, 513 A.2d 1174 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Money payments on the purchase are not enough to give an oral agreement enforceable status, even coupled with possession, in the face of this section. Chomicky v. Buttolph, 147 Vt. 128, 513 A.2d 1174 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Part performance of contract will never enable party to sustain action at law in direct violation of terms of statute. McGuirk v. Ward, 115 Vt. 221, 55 A.2d 610 (1947); Hibbard v. Whitney, 13 Vt. 21 (1841).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under Statute of Frauds, where consideration itself is executory and touching land, mere execution of agreement on the other side is not sufficient to take the case out of statute. Theberge v. Canadian Pac. Ry., 119 Vt. 193, 122 A.2d 848 (1956).
       </p>
       <p>
        Payment of purchase price by buyer is not by itself sufficient to remove case from statute. Carvage v. Stowell, 115 Vt. 187, 55 A.2d 188 (1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff had rendered services in part performance and consideration of parol contract for purchase of land, he could not rescind such contract and treat it as void and recover for said services unless defendant was unable or unwilling to proceed. Shaw v. Shaw, 6 Vt. 69 (1834).

        Notwithstanding general terms of statute, when land has been sold and conveyed to purchaser, seller may maintain an action to recover price, though not evidenced by any writing, upon ground that all of contract which is required by statute to be in writing has been fully executed and performed and that promise to pay the money does not come within statute. Theberge v. Canadian Pac. Ry., 119 Vt. 193, 122 A.2d 848 (1956).

        Under statute, in absence of written memorandum, recovery of purchase price is allowed only when transaction has been otherwise fully executed. Theberge v. Canadian Pac. Ry., 119 Vt. 193, 122 A.2d 848 (1956).
       </p>
       <p>
        An action, which merely concerns the price of land, is not required, by the Statute of Frauds, to be sustained by evidence of an agreement in writing. Hodges v. Green, 28 Vt. 358 (1856); Thayer v. Viles & Atkins, 23 Vt. 494 (1851).
       </p>
       <p>
        In contract for sale of real estate, a deed of which is executed and delivered, promise by purchaser to pay the consideration or furnish security for it, is not within statute and, if only by parol, an action may be maintained on it. Ascutney Bank v. Ormsby, 28 Vt. 721 (1856).

        <p>
         Use of word "may" in one section of statute and use of word "shall" in another section indicate an intention to differentiate between sections - "may" being permissive while "shall" is of restrictive import. Snyder v. Central Vt. Ry., 112 Vt. 190, 22 A.2d 181 (1941).
        </p>
        <p>
         "Allow" and "permit" are synonymous and convertible and are of same intent as "may." Snyder v. Central Vt. Ry., 112 Vt. 190, 22 A.2d 181 (1941).

        <p>
         In considering question of intention as to residence within meaning of this section, it is always important to consider whether party has anything to return to, and if he has, he may well be supposed to have intention to return, but if he has not, he may more reasonably be thought to carry his home with him. Cyr v. Cyr, 118 Vt. 445, 111 A.2d 735 (1955).
        </p>
        <p>
         Mere intention does not constitute residence; it must have a relation to definite place to which person has a right to return. Cyr v. Cyr, 118 Vt. 445, 111 A.2d 735 (1955).
        </p>
        <p>
         Intention alone cannot retain residence, every vestige of which is gone, with no place left to which party has right to return. Cyr v. Cyr, 118 Vt. 445, 111 A.2d 735 (1955).

        <p>
         In action for breach of promise to marry, made in Italy, to be performed there, and which was broken there, omission in declaration to lay action where suit was brought, under a videlicet, did not affect court's jurisdiction to try case, since in this state that fiction did not designate county from which jury was drawn, but place of trial was determined by statute. Massucco v. Tomasi, 80 Vt. 186, 67 A. 551 (1907), same case 78 Vt. 188, 62 A. 57.

         Where no party disputes title, an action for ejectment may properly be brought in the district court in the county where either party resides. Estate of Emilo v. St. Pierre, 146 Vt. 421, 505 A.2d 664 (1985).
        </p>
        <p>
         District court ejectment action was not a proceeding to establish or settle title to land, and venue was not governed by this section providing that actions concerning real estate shall be brought in the county in which the land lies; the action could be brought, under section 405 of this title, in the territorial unit in which one of the parties resided, and it made no difference where the property was situated.

         Action of trespass in county court is a local action because it is made so by statute. Page v. Newbury, 113 Vt. 336, 34 A.2d 218 (1943).

        <p>
         If action of trespass was brought in county court in wrong county, error was defect in process and in no way affected general jurisdiction of court over subject matter. Page v. Newbury, 113 Vt. 336, 34 A.2d 218 (1943).

        </h5>
        <p>
         Where court has jurisdiction of subject matter, defense based upon fact that suit is brought in wrong county must be seasonably asserted and failure so to plead waives objection. J.O. Bilodeau & Co. v. Reed, 119 Vt. 342, 126 A.2d 118 (1956); Collamer v. Paige, 35 Vt. 387 (1862).
        </p>
        <p>
         Statutes prescribing counties in which a defendant may be sued generally relate only to jurisdiction over person, and confer on defendant privilege with regard to the place where he may be sued which may be waived by him, and by appearing generally, defendant waives such privilege and becomes subject to jurisdiction of court. J.O. Bilodeau & Co. v. Reed, 119 Vt. 342, 126 A.2d 118 (1956).
        </p>
        <p>
         General appearance by some act which goes to merits and does not raise question of venue when it could have been raised waives objection that venue was wrong, whether it be because defendant is privileged to be sued only in county or district of his domicile or because action is brought in county or district in which neither plaintiff or defendant resides. J.O. Bilodeau & Co. v. Reed, 119 Vt. 342, 126 A.2d 118 (1956).
        </p>
        <p>
         If an action of trespass was brought in county court of wrong county, error was defect of process, and being matter of abatement was waived by failure to seasonably plead it. Page v. Newbury, 113 Vt. 336, 34 A.2d 218 (1943).

         Mere motion to abate writ on basis of nonresidence of parties was not sufficient where nonresidence did not appear on face of record, but could be made out only by proof dehors process, so plea could not be treated as motion. J.O. Bilodeau & Co. v. Reed, 119 Vt. 342, 126 A.2d 118 (1956).

         Unless an action requires the court to directly establish, quiet, attach, transfer, or bestow title to real property, provision of this section pertaining to actions concerning real estate does not apply. Bergeron v. Boyle, 176 Vt. 78, 838 A.2d 918 (2003).
        </p>
        <p>
         Since plaintiffs' request for specific performance was personal in nature - the relief sought would require defendant to fulfill his contractual obligations - their action was transitory despite its effect on real property; consequently, A county other than that where the property is located was a proper venue for plaintiffs' action.

         Fact that defendant's petition for change of venue was verified by oath of its general manager, and that no answer thereto was filed, nor counter affidavits submitted, did not require presiding judge to treat facts stated in petition as conclusive. Central Vt. Ry. v. Carpenter, 86 Vt. 67, 83 A. 466 (1911), same case 84 Vt. 538, 80 A. 657, 90 Vt. 35, 96 A. 373, 93 Vt. 357, 107 A. 569.

        <p>
         Where statute authorized county judges to direct from what towns jurors should be drawn, prejudices which would warrant change of venue must exist generally throughout county, existence in particular locality not being sufficient. Carpenter v. Central Vt. Ry., 84 Vt. 538, 80 A. 657 (1911), same case 86 Vt. 67, 83 A. 466, 90 Vt. 35, 96 A. 373, 93 Vt. 357, 107 A. 569, 58 Yale L.J. 1188.
        </p>
        <p>
         Testimony of long time residents of a county who had large acquaintance in vicinity where they lived that they never heard anything said indicating ill feeling against defendant was relevant to show that no such feeling existed. Carpenter v. Central Vt. Ry., 84 Vt. 538, 80 A. 657 (1911), same case 86 Vt. 67, 83 A. 466, 90 Vt. 35, 96 A. 373, 93 Vt. 357, 107 A. 569, 58 Yale L.J. 1188.

         This section requires that there shall be proof sufficient to satisfy conscience of judge, and to put in his mind a reasonable belief of ultimate fact that an impartial trial cannot be had in county where the case is pending, and evidence must be of relevant facts, so that judge may draw his own conclusions therefrom, opinion of witnesses being insufficient; and judge's ruling that it must "clearly appear" that justice could not be done, in order to justify change of venue, did not incorrectly state measure of proof. Willard v. Norcross, 83 Vt. 268, 75 A. 269 (1910), same case 79 Vt. 546, 65 A. 755, 81 Vt. 293, 69 A. 942, 82 Vt. 185, 72 A. 820, 86 Vt. 426, 85 A. 904.

         It did not apply to single act of selling, by one who was only transiently in town in which sale was made, and had no established business there. Stone v. Hazen, 25 Vt. 178 (1853); Wainwright v. Berry, 3 Vt. 423 (1831).

         In action of trespass on the freehold before justice of peace, writ must be made returnable in town where one of parties resides, if both parties are citizens of state, and writ will abate if made returnable in town where land lies if neither of parties resides in that town.

         Where no party disputes title, an action for ejectment may properly be brought in the district court in the county where either party resides. Estate of Emilo v. St. Pierre, 146 Vt. 421, 505 A.2d 664 (1985).

         District court ejectment action was not a proceeding to establish or settle title to land, and venue was not governed by section 402 of this title providing that actions concerning real estate shall be brought in the county in which the land lies; the action could be brought, under this section, in the territorial unit in which one of the parties resided, and it made no difference where the property was situated.

        Plain meaning of the words in the statute makes it clear that the exemption for public, pious, or charitable uses applies to all actions for which proving the statutory period for recovery of lands is an element. Thus, plaintiffs' boundary-by-acquiescence claim was barred by the exemption for public, pious, or charitable uses. Roy v. Woodstock Cmty. Trust, 195 Vt. 427, 94 A.3d 530 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because between 1981 and 2005, the property in question was owned by a non-profit church and dedicated to religious and community uses, the exemption for pious uses applied and negated plaintiffs' adverse possession claims. Roy v. Woodstock Cmty. Trust, 195 Vt. 427, 94 A.3d 530 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is self-evident that the qualifying criteria set forth in American Museum and its progeny for public or charitable uses have no application to the pious-use exemption from adverse possession. The question must turn generally, therefore, on whether a property meets the standard for pious use, subject to the more limiting requirements of the property tax exemption. Roy v. Woodstock Cmty. Trust, 195 Vt. 427, 94 A.3d 530 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        To the extent the pious-use exception to the statutory fifteen-year prescriptive period was a defense, it was not an affirmative defense, and there was no obligation to defendant to plead the application of the statute in its answer to plaintiffs' adverse possession claims. Roy v. Woodstock Cmty. Trust, Inc., 94 Vt. 530, 195 A.3d 427 (Nov. 1, 2013).

        Statute which exempted church property from adverse possession claims or prescriptive easements did not violate Establishment Clause of First Amendment, since property dedicated to "pious" use was included among a broad class of property in the statute, there was no direct governmental support for religious activities, effect of statute was not to either advance or inhibit religion, and statute did not foster excessive government entanglement with religion.

        Where a donor, in 1807, conveyed a parcel of land to a town subject to the town building a meeting house thereon and continuing to use it for that purpose, and where the town, in 1927, breached the deed restriction by building a school on the property and erecting a new meeting house on separate property, the fee automatically reverted to the heirs of the donor and the property was not "given" or "appropriated" for a public purpose by its legal owners.
    Accordingly, from that point on, the town was not barred by 12 V.S.A.
        ยง
        462. In re .88 Acres, 165 Vt. 17, 676 A.2d 778 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether municipal land was given to a public use thus exempting it from a claim of adverse possession, the reason the property was acquired by the town, the uses made since its acquisition, and evidence of manifest intent to use the property in the future are to be considered. Jarvis v. Gillespie, 155 Vt. 633, 587 A.2d 981 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly found plaintiff had carried his burden to prove acquisition of title to municipal land by adverse possession where plaintiff openly, notoriously, hostilely and continuously possessed the property in excess of the statutory period and property had not been given to a public use, such as would exempt it from plaintiff's claim. Jarvis v. Gillespie, 155 Vt. 633, 587 A.2d 981 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under statutory exemption of municipal lands given to a public use from claims of adverse possession, land which is owned by a municipality is presumed to be given to such use; however, this presumption can be rebutted by demonstrating that the town has abandoned any plans for the land. Jarvis v. Gillespie, 155 Vt. 633, 587 A.2d 981 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where town acquired parcel in settlement of a debt, the parcel was not used by the public during the next 51 years, following which the town conveyed the parcel to a private individual, trial court properly concluded the parcel was not given to a public use and therefore not exempt from plaintiff's claim of adverse possession. Jarvis v. Gillespie, 155 Vt. 633, 587 A.2d 981 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Grant of land, being for a public use, was protected from acquisition by adverse possession. Addison County v. Blackmer, 101 Vt. 384, 143 A. 700 (1928), overruled on other grounds, Lague, Inc. v. Royea (1989) 152 Vt. 499, 568 A.2d 357; University of Vermont v. Reynolds' Ex'r, 3 Vt. 542 (1831).

        Because the primary use of property of a fraternal organization property was for private meetings, such use could not be found to benefit an indefinite segment of the public at large; therefore, the property could not qualify for an exemption under the charitable use exception to the adverse possession statute.

       <p>
        Focus of the charitable exemption from the statute of limitations is not on lands held by a public, pious or charitable user but rather on lands given, granted, sequestered or appropriated to a public, pious or charitable use. Defendant's predecessor's only use of the property during its years of ownership was as a charitable summer camp, and thus the land was appropriated to a charitable use during the entirety of its ownership. Mahoney v. Tara, LLC, 197 Vt. 412, 107 A.3d 887 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the trial court's reading of the public, pious or charitable use exception to the statutory 15-year prescriptive period was in line with the court's precedent, with precedents from other jurisdictions, and with the policy concerns behind the provision, the trial court properly held that plaintiffs could not rely on the years during which a church owned the property in question and dedicated it to a public, pious or charitable use to make their adverse possession claims. Roy v. Woodstock Cmty. Trust, Inc., 94 Vt. 530, 195 A.3d 427 (Nov. 1, 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        As there was no dispute that defendant's property, when owned by a church, was dedicated to pious use and operated on a nonprofit basis, the pious-use exemption negated plaintiffs' claim for adverse possession. Roy v. Woodstock Cmty. Trust, Inc., 94 Vt. 530, 195 A.3d 427 (Nov. 1, 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Policy behind the exception for public, pious, or charitable uses - that land should not be lost to the State and public through the laches or ignorance of the public or of officials representing it - applies with equal force to claims of boundary by acquiescence. Accordingly, plaintiffs' boundary-by-acquiescence claim was barred when the property had been used by a church for pious uses. Roy v. Woodstock Cmty. Trust, Inc., 94 Vt. 530, 195 A.3d 427 (Nov. 1, 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Reversal and remand were required when the trial court relied on the name of an organization to infer that its use of the property in question necessarily had a pious or charitable purpose. The name alone did not reveal whether the use of the property was for a privileged purpose. Mahoney v. Tara, LLC, 189 Vt. 557, 15 A.3d 122 (mem.) (2011).

       <p>
        Vermont Code limits the applicability of the statutory fifteen-year prescriptive period with respect to lands that are or have been dedicated to public, pious, or charitable use during the prescriptive period. The effect of the exemption is to control what periods the adverse possessor can count in order to show fifteen years of open, notorious, hostile and continuous use or possession. Roy v. Woodstock Cmty. Trust, Inc., 94 Vt. 530, 195 A.3d 427 (Nov. 1, 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        For purposes of an adverse possession claim, the period during which the land falls under the public, pious or charitable use exception cannot be counted toward the statutory 15-year prescriptive period, even when the land is no longer in public, pious or charitable use. Roy v. Woodstock Cmty. Trust, Inc., 94 Vt. 530, 195 A.3d 427 (Nov. 1, 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Element of a claim of boundary by acquiescence is possession for the full statutory period, as defined by the limitations period for the recovery of land, and an exemption limits the applicability of the limitations period to lands dedicated to public, pious, or charitable use. The plain meaning of the words in the statute makes it clear that the exemption applies to all actions for which proving the statutory period defined in the limitations period is an element. Roy v. Woodstock Cmty. Trust, Inc., 94 Vt. 530, 195 A.3d 427 (Nov. 1, 2013).

        Statute governing actions specially limited by other provisions signals that applicable statutes of limitations outside of Title 12, Chapter 23 trump potentially applicable limitations periods within that chapter.

        It applies to cases within statute and also to those without statute because subject matter is not included therein or because it may be said that they are not within on account of some express exception or exemption. University of Vermont v. Carter, 110 Vt. 206, 3 A.2d 533 (1938).

       <p>
        In cases within statute mere length of possession, unaccompanied by other circumstances, is not sufficient to raise presumption of grant, for where possession has existed for length of time prescribed by statute it becomes barred by operation of the statute, while if it has existed for less time, it must be aided by other circumstances or presumption cannot arise.

       <p>
        For purposes of an adverse possession claim, the period during which the land falls under the public, pious or charitable use exception cannot be counted toward the statutory 15-year prescriptive period, even when the land is no longer in public, pious or charitable use. Roy v. Woodstock Cmty. Trust, Inc., 94 Vt. 530, 195 A.3d 427 (Nov. 1, 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the trial court's reading of the public, pious or charitable use exception to the statutory 15-year prescriptive period was in line with the court's precedent, with precedents from other jurisdictions, and with the policy concerns behind the provision, the trial court properly held that plaintiffs could not rely on the years during which a church owned the property in question and dedicated it to a public, pious or charitable use to make their adverse possession claims.

       <p>
        Exemption for public, pious or charitable uses limits the applicability of the statute of limitations for the recovery of land with respect to lands that are or have been dedicated to public, pious, or charitable use during the prescriptive period; its effect is to control what periods the adverse possessor can count in order to show 15 years of open, notorious, hostile, and continuous use or possession. To the extent it can be considered a defense, it is not an affirmative defense, and the rule regarding pleadings imposes no obligation upon defendant to plead the application of the statute in an answer.

        Possession of property by remaindermen subsequent to the date when the remainder interests became possessory upon the death of the last surviving life tenant was not sufficient to establish a claim of adverse possession where the possession was not of sufficient duration to satisfy the requisite statutory period of 15 years.

        Adverse possession claim is really one for recognition of title and enforcement of the rights that accompany title.

        Element of a claim of boundary by acquiescence is possession for the full statutory period, as defined by the limitations period for the recovery of land, and an exemption limits the applicability of the limitations period to lands dedicated to public, pious, or charitable use. The plain meaning of the words in the statute makes it clear that the exemption applies to all actions for which proving the statutory period defined in the limitations period is an element. Roy v. Woodstock Cmty. Trust, Inc., 94 Vt. 530, 195 A.3d 427 (Nov. 1, 2013).

        Vermont Code limits the applicability of the statutory 15-year prescriptive period with respect to lands that are or have been dedicated to public, pious, or charitable use during the prescriptive period. The effect of the exemption is to control what periods the adverse possessor can count in order to show 15 years of open, notorious, hostile and continuous use or possession. Roy v. Woodstock Cmty.

        To achieve title through adverse possession, a claimant must demonstrate that possession of land was open, notorious, hostile and continuous throughout statutory period of 15 years. N.A.S.

        In view of evidence of open, notorious and continuous use of disputed portion of land from 1929 to 1976 by the parties claiming title by adverse possession and absent any evidence that, prior to 1944, this use was by permission, record was sufficient to support claim of title by adverse possession as early as 1944.

        The trial court erred in its decision granting claimants a strip of land upon which their predecessor in interest had built a stone wall and tended a flower garden; the property owners' could easily have assumed that the maintenance of the garden area was simply part of the predecessor's work as their groundskeeper and, under these circumstances, despite the existence of the stone wall, the evidence was not sufficient to establish the element of hostility required for an adverse possession claim to succeed.

       <p>
        Claimant's use of property was sufficiently continuous to establish adverse possession as to floor of quarry; although land was not always worked to its maximum capacity, there was continuous notice of occupancy, and periods of time when operations slowed or stopped were consistent with exigencies of a family-run business and it was clear that claimant's family intended to continue working there. N.A.S. Holdings, Inc. v. Pafundi, 169 Vt. 437, 736 A.2d 780 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1079, 120 S. Ct. 798, 145 L. Ed. 2d 672 (2000).

       </p>
       <p>
        To constitute continuous possession of lands, in order to obtain title by adverse possession, the law does not require the occupant to be present on the site at all times, rather, there may be lapses of time between acts of possession, that is the occupancy need only be that consistent with the nature and character of the premises; and in the case of lake-side camps, such occupation is, in the literal sense, only during certain periods of the year.

       </p>

        There is presumption that use of land by one who has legal title of record thereto is the exercise of his right to enjoy it and such use, if in exercise of right of ownership, interrupts continuity of adverse possession by another. Barrell v. Renehan, 114 Vt. 23, 39 A.2d 330 (1944).

       <p>
        Because trial court found that property in question was clearly bounded, its conclusion that claimant had established adverse possession of quarry floor necessarily led to conclusion that she established adverse possession of entire quarry, and therefore trial court's denial of adverse possession with respect to quarry walls was reversed. N.A.S. Holdings, Inc. v. Pafundi, 169 Vt. 437, 736 A.2d 780 (1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1079, 120 S. Ct. 798, 145 L. Ed. 2d 672 (2000).

        The trial court properly awarded a prescriptive easement to claimants for use of the property owners' driveway for all types of vehicles, not simply personal passenger vehicles, where it found that the claimants' predecessor in interest used the driveway "for all types of vehicles including, but not limited to, cars, trucks, horse trailers, and hay wagons." Macdonough-Webster Lodge No. 26, Free And Accepted Masons v. Wells, 175 Vt. 382, 834 A.2d 25 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        The elements necessary to establish a prescriptive easement and adverse possession are essentially the same: an adverse use or possession which is open, notorious, hostile and continuous for a period of 15 years, and acquiescence in the use or possession by the person against whom the claim is asserted. Community Feed Store, Inc. v. Northeastern Culvert Corp., 151 Vt. 152, 559 A.2d 1068 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a prescriptive easement is claimed, the extent of the use must be proved not with absolute precision, but only as to the general outlines consistent with the pattern of use throughout the prescriptive period; where a claimant adduces enough evidence to prove those general outlines with reasonable certainty, it has met its burden on that issue. Community Feed Store, Inc. v. Northeastern Culvert Corp., 151 Vt. 152, 559 A.2d 1068 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff's prescriptive easement over portion of gravel area owned by defendant and used by trucks and cars coming to plaintiff's loading areas was supported by findings that vehicles had been continuously using the area in similar manner since 1920s, until defendant erected barrier in 1984 following survey showing land belonged to defendant, by rule that open and notorious use would be presumed adverse, and by proof of plaintiff's chain of title from predecessors in interest from 1929. Community Feed Store, Inc. v. Northeastern Culvert Corp., 151 Vt. 152, 559 A.2d 1068 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Extent of plaintiff's prescriptive easement over portion of gravel area owned by defendant and used by trucks and cars coming to plaintiff's loading areas was sufficiently proved by testimony showing extent of gravel area, surveys showing exact boundary of plaintiff's land, photographs showing gravel area and loading area, and diagram showing use of gravel area by trucks and cars. Community Feed Store, Inc. v. Northeastern Culvert Corp., 151 Vt. 152, 559 A.2d 1068 (1989).

        Right to an easement in another's land acquired by long use and enjoyment is analogous to right acquired by adverse possession; and rules of law applicable to two cases are in harmony. Abatiell v. Morse, 115 Vt. 254, 56 A.2d 464 (1947).
       </p>
       <p>
        In this state, in analogy to statute of limitations, prescriptive right, or more properly, presumption of grant to incorporeal hereditaments, arises from 15 years occupancy and possession adverse to owner or proprietor. Mitchell v. Walker, 2 Aik. 266 (1827).

       <p>
        Presumptive rights, acquired by long use and enjoyment, are analogous to those arising under statute, and use and enjoyment must be adverse and uninterrupted for period limited by statute. Shumway v. Simons, 1 Vt. 53 (1827).

        Where easement by adverse user is claimed, burden is on plaintiff affirmatively to prove all elements of adverse user. Dwinell v. Alberghini, 115 Vt. 394, 62 A.2d 124 (1948).

        Prima facie defendant's enjoyment of his land was an exercise of his right so to enjoy it; and it was for plaintiffs to show that what he did with reference to his property was consistent with their claim and not for him to show that his actions were inconsistent with it.

       </h5>
       <p>
        To acquire right of way by adverse use, plaintiff must have used same, within its definite limits, uninterruptedly, openly, notoriously and adversely to defendant's rights and use, for 15 years. Plimpton v. Converse, 44 Vt. 158 (1871), same case 42 Vt. 712, 111 A.L.R. 221, 170 A.L.R. 826, 46 A.L.R.2d 1158.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fifteen years use necessary to maintain prescriptive right of way, would not commence running until way began to be used under claim of right; but fact that such claim was made may be proved by words, together with use; or the mere use of the way, if expressly shown to have come to the knowledge of owner of soil, will prima facie establish the fact that use was under claim of right, unless owner of soil did not so understand it, and was not bound to so regard it from the nature and extent of the use. Dodge v. Stacy, 39 Vt. 558 (1867), same case 77 Vt. 230, 59 A. 839, 5 A.L.R. 1558, 50 A.L.R. 1269; Dee v. King, 73 Vt. 375, 50 A. 1109 (1901); Tracy v. Atherton, 36 Vt. 503 (1864), same case 35 Vt. 52, 43 A.L.R. 943, 171 A.L.R. 1281.
       </p>
       <p>
        Right of way could be acquired by adverse possession as against husband, but not as against wife, over land of which husband had life use, with remainder to the wife or her heirs. Coleman v. Aldrich, 61 Vt. 340, 17 A. 848 (1889).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant did not gain a right to plaintiff's part of the pent road by her acts of occupation, for they were not adverse but only the ordinary use of the land for highway purposes in common with the public. Carpenter v. Cook, 71 Vt. 110, 41 A. 1038 (1898), same case 67 Vt. 102, 30 A. 998.

       <p>
        In the case of a promissory note secured by a mortgage, the impetus of securing a debt with a mortgage is to provide the mortgagee with certain protections that the promissory note alone does not provide; among these protections, to which both parties to a mortgage implicitly agree, is an extended statute of limitations which allows a mortgagee to enforce the debt beyond the life of the promissory note.

        Cause of action for breach of a restrictive covenant accrues upon breach of the covenant. Where the alleged covenant violations involve the construction of a noncomplying structure, the construction itself, and not merely preparatory steps that may be necessary predicates to the construction but do not themselves constitute or require the construction, starts the limitations period.

        To the extent neighbors sought to invoke an alleged longstanding covenant violation on Lot A to enjoin construction of a new dwelling on Lot B, the statute of limitations would bar their claims.

        Plaintiff's reconfiguration of her lot lines and procurement of a revised subdivision permit from the State of Vermont in the 1980s, while necessary steps to building a dwelling on the reconfigured lot, were not sufficient to constitute the alleged violation of the restrictive covenant provisions that defendants invoked in opposition to plaintiff's building plans, and thus did not trigger the statute of limitations.

        Where appellant argued that the adoption of V.R.C.P. 69 and V.R.C.P. 81 abolished the common law action of debt on a judgment, Supreme Court found no merit in this contention, because the Vermont legislature had made statutory revisions since the adoption of the rules of procedure that directly acknowledged the existence of the action, and, more importantly, V.R.C.P. 69 could not properly abolish the civil action on a judgment, since the enabling act that authorized the rules of procedure expressly stated that "[the] rules thus prescribed shall not abridge, enlarge or modify any substantive rights of any person provided by law."

        For purposes of the statute of limitations for renewing a judgment, a 2002 judgment, rather than a 2004 order, controlled, as the 2002 judgment ended the litigation between the parties and finally disposed of the matter, whereas the 2004 order merely set forth the outstanding amount due on the original judgment and reflected the terms under which continuing payments would be made. Flex A Seal v. Safford, 198 Vt. 496, 117 A.3d 823 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Same tolling rule applicable to contract actions applies to actions on judgment debts. Thus, defendant's acknowledgment and payment of a judgment debt tolled the limitations period for renewing a judgment. Flex A Seal v. Safford, 198 Vt. 496, 117 A.3d 823 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Action to renew a judgment was timely because the action to renew a judgment was brought within eight years after the underlying judgment was rendered; that the statute of limitations was tolled from the date the action to renew a judgment was brought was not affected by the fact the appellate court vacated the district court's grant of summary judgment in favor of the party
    that had sought renewal. Okemo Mt., Inc. v. Sikorski, - F. Supp. 2d - (D. Vt. Oct. 23, 2003).

        While ordinarily no advantage is gained by bringing an action in the same state upon a judgment if the statute of limitation period has almost run upon the judgment, pursuant to 12 V.S.A.
        ยง
        506, the judgment creditor can start the limitation period anew by bringing an action upon the judgment and obtaining a new judgment; this is precisely what the judgment creditor did in the case at bar. The fact that his original judgment was "dormant" at the time he commenced his action is not a bar to the action. Koerber v. Middlesex College, 136 Vt. 4, 383 A.2d 1054 (1978).

        When the trial court approved proposed qualified domestic relations orders, but the orders were never "qualified" because they were never approved by a plan administrator, there was no judgment to execute or enforce, and the husband's motion, in which he sought to compel the wife to transfer the retirement funds to him with interest, was not barred under the eight-year limitations period for actions on judgments.

        .
       </h5>
       <p>
        Appellee's attempt to enforce a judgment was time-barred, as the statute governing renewal of judgments required that renewals of judgments be brought by filing a new and independent action seeking renewal within eight years of the judgment's rendition, whereas here, both motions seeking enforcement of the judgments were filed in the original 2006 divorce action; furthermore, the rule governing motions after judgments in family proceedings was limited to post-judgment proceedings in an existing divorce action and did not extend the statute of limitations on judgments. Blake v. Petrie, - Vt.
    - , 245 A.3d 768 (Oct. 16, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is evident that the legislature intended the words "rendition of the judgment" in the statute regarding the limitations period for bringing actions on judgments to encompass renewed judgments, and that when a judgment is renewed - in Vermont or elsewhere under another state's laws - the date of the renewed judgment is controlling for purposes of the statute. If the statute of limitation period has almost run upon the judgment, the judgment creditor can start the limitation period anew by bringing an action upon the judgment and obtaining a new judgment. H&E Equip. Servs., Inc. v. Cassani Elec., Inc., 204 Vt. 559, 169 A.3d 1308 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under Vermont law, judgments, including renewed judgments, must be acted upon - or renewed again - within eight years of the date they were issued. Here, the 2001 Arizona judgment was renewed in 2011 and plaintiff brought the action in 2015, well within the eight-year limitation period; thus, the enforcement action was not time-barred. H&E Equip. Servs., Inc. v. Cassani Elec., Inc., 204 Vt. 559, 169 A.3d 1308 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        2001 judgment was not renewed when plaintiffs filed a motion for a possessory writ of attachment and eventually entered into a stipulated agreement with defendant regarding his payment of the 2001 debt. While defendant might have had notice and an opportunity to respond to plaintiffs' motion, that did not transform plaintiffs' motion into a complaint. Ayer v. Hemingway, 193 Vt. 610, 73 A.3d 673 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Russo plainly requires a new and independent suit initiated by the filing of a complaint to renew a judgment, not the filing of something that is arguably akin to a complaint. Any other conclusion would reintroduce uncertainty into the judgment renewal process. Ayer v. Hemingway, 193 Vt. 610, 73 A.3d 673 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        The judgment of the district court (which granted company's motion for summary judgment in action to renew judgment) was vacated and remanded where the language of the release was exceptionally broad but might reasonably be construed more narrowly to release agents of the principal only in their representative capacities; a trial was necessary to consider what was within the contemplation of the parties when the release was executed, which in turn is to be resolved in the light of the surrounding facts and circumstances under which the parties acted.

        A specialty within meaning of this section is a writing sealed and delivered - a contract under seal. McAllister v. Northern Oil Co., 115 Vt. 465, 64 A.2d 31 (1948); Coral Gables, Inc. v. Christopher, 108 Vt. 414, 189 A. 147 (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        Common law required that a seal be of wax or a wafer or something that would take an impression, and word "seal" after signature was not enough to make an instrument a specialty at common law. McAllister v. Northern Oil Co., 115 Vt. 465, 64 A.2d 31 (1948). See, however, 1 V.S.A.

        In action for debt on guardian's bond, brought more than eight years after guardian had settled his account with court, and he had been ordered to pay over to ward amount in his hands, right of action accrued at time of such settlement and order, action was barred by this section, and it made no difference whether action was considered as action in favor of probate court or of prosecutor and real plaintiff.

        Written contract, having usual form of a promissory note in every particular, except that it was payable in some specific article, was so far a promissory note, that, if witnessed, it was not barred by the statute of limitations until 14 years.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Statute governing actions specially limited by other provisions signals that applicable statutes of limitations outside of title 12, chapter 23 trump potentially applicable limitations periods within that chapter. Accordingly, the six-year statute of limitations in the Uniform Commercial Code for negotiable demand notes prevailed over the 14-year limitations period for witnessed promissory notes in chapter 23 of title 12. Clark v. Distefano, 208 Vt. 139, 195 A.3d 379 (2018).

       <p>
        Where maker of notes wrote on back thereof word "renewed," together with date and his signature, and caused another person to sign as witness to his signature, this constituted new promise to pay, renewed notes, and made them "signed in the presence of an attesting witness," within meaning of this section. Chaffee's Sons v. Estate of Blanchard, 105 Vt. 389, 165 A. 912 (1933), same case 105 Vt. 442, 168 A. 695.
       </p>
       <p>
        Where promissory note was attested by wife of payee as witness with knowledge and consent of maker, he could not afterwards object that it was not a witnessed note within this section. Alexander v. Hanley, 64 Vt. 361, 24 A. 242 (1892).
       </p>
       <p>
        If promissory note was signed by two or more, witness thereto, if there be but one, must have been present and signed as witness to execution of whole note, to allow an action to be brought upon it at any time within 14 years. Lapham v. Briggs, 27 Vt. 26 (1854).

       </h5>
       <p>
        When note itself indicates that calls for payment are to be indefinitely prospective, and to be made as might suit wants and convenience of payee, there is no ground furnished upon which law can assume any fixed point as limit to reasonable time for making demand, and therefore give operation to statute of limitations. C & T Discount Corp. v. Sawyer, 123 Vt. 238, 185 A.2d 462 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute of limitations will not begin to run if there is something in note or in circumstances under which it was given showing that actual demand or delay for payment was contemplated by parties. C & T Discount Corp. v. Sawyer, 123 Vt. 238, 185 A.2d 462 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute did not begin to run on note until principal, or at least some separate and distinct portion of principal, became due and payable - and then only on such distinct and separate portion, and interest, accruing from year to year, was not thus separated from principal demand, and consequently statute did not run on it, until principal was barred by statute.

        Indorsement by maker of witnessed guaranty upon promissory note within 14 years before bringing of the suit was no answer to statute when pleaded to declaration upon note itself, and whatever effect of such an indorsement might be as a contract in and of itself, it did not convert original note into witnessed note. Fletcher v. Munroe, 61 Vt. 406, 17 A. 799 (1889).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plea of statute of limitations of six years was sufficient answer to general count in debt for money had and received; and, if a witnessed note was offered in evidence under such a plea, advantage of the 14 years limitation was thereby waived. Lapham v. Briggs, 27 Vt. 26 (1854).
       </p>
       <p>
        Declaration describing a note without any consideration expressed in the note, but describing a consideration distinct from the note itself, set forth a note within statute. Leonard v. Walker, Brayt. 203 (1820).

       </p>
       <p>
        Mere fact that economic harm is alleged will not invariably invoke the general six-year statute of limitations applicable in civil actions where the gravamen or essence of the claim remains personal injury. Thus, the case had to be remanded for the trial court to consider whether the claims for economic harm were sufficiently distinct from the claims for emotional distress to be governed by the six-year statute of limitations and therefore remained timely. Eaton v. Prior, 192 Vt. 249, 58 A.3d 200 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Six-year statute of limitations applied to malpractice claim brought by mother against psychologist with whom she contracted in connection with custody dispute; although mother's claim sought personal injury damages for emotional distress, to which a three-year limitation period would normally apply, some of the damages she sought were for economic losses that did not constitute personal injuries, and thus the six-year limitation period applied. Politi v. Tyler, 170 Vt. 428, 751 A.2d 788 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court was required to look to underlying harm in determining applicable statute of limitations, and thus indemnification action for damage to condominiums was properly categorized as an action for damage to real property as opposed to personal property; same limitation period and date of accrual was therefore to be applied to indemnity action as would be applied to underlying action. Investment Properties, Inc. v. Lyttle, 169 Vt. 487, 739 A.2d 1222 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        The nature of the harm done, rather than plaintiff's characterization of the action, is the determining factor in construing the applicability of this section. Stevers v. E. T. & H. K. Ide Co., 148 Vt. 12, 527 A.2d 658 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Complaint alleging that use of insecticide in barn killed one cow and caused damage to others stated a cause of action for damage to personal property within the meaning of section 512(5) of this title, notwithstanding plaintiff's assertion that the complaint sounded in fraud and should be governed by this section because he had purchased the insecticide under the representation that it was safe for spraying animals. Stevers v. E. T. & H. K. Ide Co., 148 Vt. 12, 527 A.2d 658 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Determination of applicable limitation period depends on nature of the harm suffered rather than nature of action brought. Fitzgerald v. Congleton, 155 Vt. 283, 583 A.2d 595 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is the nature of the harm done which determines which limitations provision applies. Foucher v. First Vermont Bank & Trust Co., 821 F. Supp. 916 (D. Vt. 1993).

        For purposes of the six-year statute of limitations, appellant was placed on inquiry notice by April 2008, when he learned that a deed had been recorded which allegedly transferred title out of his name into someone else's, and when he was also informed by the mortgagee that an unauthorized transfer of the property had occurred, or at the latest in May 2008, when his bankruptcy attorney conducted a title search in relation to his bankruptcy proceedings and discovered the conveyance. Jadallah v. Town of Fairfax, 207 Vt. 413, 186 A.3d 1111 (Mar. 23, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in determining that plaintiffs' claim for legal malpractice accrued before the conclusion of the appeal in the underlying proceeding. Fritzeen v. Gravel, 175 Vt. 537, 830 A.2d 49 (mem.) (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Cause of action for negligent misrepresentation and consumer fraud in connection with the purchase of a house accrued when plaintiffs received a letter stating that the property was zoned as a single-family dwelling and that multiple-family housing was not allowed in the district. Galfetti v. Berg, Carmolli & Kent Real Estate Corp., 171 Vt. 523, 756 A.2d 1229 (mem.) (2000).

        In school district's action against architects alleging negligent design of leaky roof of school building in violation of contract for architectural services, court would not hold that statute of limitations did not begin to run until the plaintiff discovered the precise cause of the leaks. Union School District #20 v. Lench, 134 Vt. 424, 365 A.2d 508 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        As a general rule, a cause of action accrues when the act upon which the legal action is based took place, not when the act is discovered. In re Peterson, 93 B.R. 323 (Bankr. D. Vt. 1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Rule that the cause of action shall be deemed to accrue as of the date of the discovery of the injury should be read into six-year statute of limitations for civil actions. University of Vermont v. W. R. Grace & Co., 152 Vt. 287, 565 A.2d 1354 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Insured's action to recover uninsured motorist benefits accrued two months after she retained legal counsel, by which time counsel should have discovered motorist's uninsured status and communicated it to insured, thereby making insured's claim one timely filed for purposes of Vermont's 6 year statute of limitations. Kauffman v. State Farm Mutual Automobile Ins. Co., 857 F. Supp. 23 (D. Vt. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Right of action accrues when plaintiff can first sue for and recover demand, and statute begins to run from that date. Lycoming Fire Ins. Co. v. Batcheller, 62 Vt. 148, 19 A. 982 (1890); Farnham v. Thomas, 56 Vt. 33 (1884).
       </p>

        Taking out of writ was commencement of action within statute of limitations. Chapman v. Goodrich, 55 Vt. 354 (1883); Allan v. Mann, 1 D. Chip. 94 (1797).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where a demand is necessary to perfect claim, statute only runs from demand made. Thrall v. Estate of Mead, 40 Vt. 540 (1868); Stanton v. Estate of Stanton, 37 Vt. 411 (1865); Page v. Thrall, 11 Vt. 230 (1839); Staniford v. Tuttle, 4 Vt. 82 (1831); Hutchinson v. Parkhurst, 1 Aik. 258 (1826); Poultney v. Wells, 1 Aik. 180 (1826).
       </p>
       <p>
        When delay in making demand is expressly contemplated from terms of note, there is no rule of law that requires the demand to be made within statutory period for bringing an action. New England Fire Ins. Co. v. Haynes, 71 Vt. 306, 45 A. 221 (1899).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where debt is payable on demand, demand will not be presumed within six years, if terms of contract or circumstances of transaction are such as to indicate that parties contemplated delay in making of demand. Smith v. Franklin, 61 Vt. 385, 17 A. 838 (1889).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where promissory note payable "five months from date" bore written consent of makers that payee might collect at any time "by discounting a proportional amount of interest that shall have been paid in advance", statute began to run at once, without demand and without tender of such "proportional amount." Dawley v. Wheeler, 52 Vt. 574 (1880).
       </p>
       <p>
        No presumption of demand and refusal arose from lapse of time, but rather the contrary, and statute had not run upon note. Beeman v. Cook, 48 Vt. 201 (1876).
       </p>
       <p>
        Creditor may be guilty of such unreasonable neglect in omitting to make demand as will set statute in operation without demand. Thrall v. Estate of Mead, 40 Vt. 540 (1868).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where instrument itself indicated that calls for payment were to be indefinitely prospective, and to be made as might suit wants and convenience of payee, there was no ground upon which law could assume any fixed point, as limit to reasonable time for making demand, and therefrom give operation to statute of limitations. Stanton v. Estate of Stanton, 37 Vt. 411 (1865).
       </p>
       <p>
        When statute was pleaded to an action on promissory note payable "when demanded," plaintiff would not be allowed to prove note had been lost for a time, in order to rebut presumption that a demand had been made. Kingsbury v. Butler, 4 Vt. 458 (1832).
       </p>
       <p>
        Demand may as well be presumed, as any other fact, from lapse of time and such dealings between parties as render it very improbable that claim could have been forgotten while it was worthy of any consideration. Staniford v. Tuttle, 4 Vt. 82 (1831).

        Right to plead statute is a personal privilege of which debtor may avail himself or not as he chooses. Hartford v. School District, 69 Vt. 147, 37 A. 252 (1896).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is competent for the makers of promissory note to stipulate therein that they will waive statute. Lyndon Sav. Bank v. International Co., 78 Vt. 169, 62 A. 50 (1905), same case 75 Vt. 224, 54 A. 191, 18 B.U.L. Rev. State Trust Co. v. Sheldon, 68 Vt. 259, 35 A. 177 (1895); Burton v. Stevens, 24 Vt. 131 (1852).
       </p>
       <p>
        "Good at any time," endorsed on note and signed and dated by the payor, was not a waiver of statute, but was merely an acknowledgment of debt evidenced by note, from which promise to pay may be implied. Rowell v. Estate of Lewis, 72 Vt. 163, 47 A. 783 (1899).

        Abolished school district had right to pay just debt though barred by statute, and could insist that such debt be deducted in determining balance due from district to town. Hartford v. School District, 69 Vt. 147, 37 A. 252 (1896).

        In action on a note executed in Florida more than six years prior to bringing of suit, on which the printed word "seal" appeared after signature, six-year statute of limitations was well pleaded on plaintiff's exception to overruling of demurrer. Coral Gables, Inc. v. Christopher, 108 Vt. 414, 189 A. 147 (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where one by contract in writing had bound himself to convey certain lands which he had bid off at vendue, statute of limitations was good plea in a bill in chancery brought by other contracting party to compel him to specific performance, or to pay over what he had received on sale of lands. Adm'r of Collard v. Tuttle, 4 Vt. 491 (1832).
       </p>

        Where debt was barred by statute, creditor could not plead it in bar to suit brought by debtor against him in reference to an independent transaction. Parker v. National Life Ins. Co., 61 Vt. 65, 17 A. 724 (1888).

        In absence of either a promise or any misrepresentation or concealment of a fraudulent character, there cannot be an equitable estoppel precluding a defendant from setting up the bar of the statute of limitations, and existence of family relationship did not allow brother to avoid bar of statute of limitations in his suit for specific performance.

        There was no difference between actions of assumpsit and book account, in respect of what items are barred by statute of limitations. Holt v. Howard, 77 Vt. 49, 58 A. 797 (1903).
       </p>
       <p>
        When it appeared that plaintiff and defendant intended that all their business deal except notes should be mutual and open account, and that charges of each should apply in payment of the charges of other, all such business deal except notes should, in respect of statute, be reciprocally applied as proper matter of an open and current book account. Holt v. Howard, 77 Vt. 49, 58 A. 797 (1903).
       </p>

        In the case of a promissory note secured by a mortgage, the impetus of securing a debt with a mortgage is to provide the mortgagee with certain protections that the promissory note alone does not provide; among these protections, to which both parties to a mortgage implicitly agree, is an extended statute of limitations which allows a mortgagee to enforce the debt beyond the life of the promissory note.

        Plaintiffs' action for negligence and breach of contract was time-barred because by 2005 at the latest, plaintiffs were aware of facts sufficient to lead any reasonable homeowner to investigate the condition of their roof when they had experienced a major, unprecedented leak for which they filed an insurance claim, rust spots had appeared, the ice damning problem which the roof was supposed to mitigate was worse than ever, and plaintiffs had attempted various repairs. While they might not have known the extent of the defect in the roof, it was apparent by 2005 that it was defective. Abajian v. Truexcullins, Inc., 205 Vt. 331, 176 A.3d 524 (2017).

       <p>
        When a couple claimed that a town and its officials discriminated against them in zoning and permitting decisions on the basis of their sexual orientation, the six-year statute of limitations was applicable, because the nature of the alleged harms was mixed; the couple claimed the town's actions harmed their rights to privacy and quiet enjoyment of property, fostered a hostile environment, and caused financial harm in terms of attorney fees and bankruptcy.

       </p>
       <p>

        Defendants' counterclaim against a trustee's estate for breach of fiduciary duty was time-barred. At the time they rejected the trustee's proposition in 1993, defendants knew that the trustee had been both a trustee and a beneficiary since the trust's creation, and defendants were sufficiently informed of the circumstances surrounding ownership of the property in question to enable them to assess the trustee's actions and seek redress if they believed she had breached her fiduciary duties as trustee.

        Long arm statute, as amended in 1968 to permit service of process outside the state for personal judgment actions, did not supersede the 1961 amendment to the statute allowing service via the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles. Accordingly, the three-year statute of limitations was tolled when defendant resided out of state for the entire period and had no property in Vermont. Andrews v.

        Trustee was not entitled to reopen bankruptcy case to administer previously undisclosed personal injury claim recovery, based on defective medical device, because debtor's recovery was not property of estate since it did not accrue under Vermont law prior to petition date, given that debtor was unaware of defect until years after her case was closed, and it was not "sufficiently rooted" in her pre-bankruptcy past. In re Vasquez, 581 B.R. 59 (Bankr. D. Vt. 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Claim for custodial interference was timely under Vermont's three-year limitations period for personal injury actions because even if custodial parent effectively discovered that her former partner had fled with their child in 2009, a reasonable person in her position would not have been on notice that her former partner's counsel played the role that they did. If the parent's allegations were assumed to be true, counsels' deliberate attempts to mislead the courts would also have misled a reasonable person about the cause of the parent's injury, as well as counsels' potential liability for those injuries. Jenkins v. Miller, - F. Supp. 2d - (D. Vt. Sept. 29, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly held that plaintiffs' claims for emotional distress arising out of a polygraph examination were time-barred under the three-year statute of limitations for injuries to the person. Before plaintiffs received an analysis by a different polygraph examiner, they had identified nearly all of the deficiencies that formed the basis of their complaint. Eaton v. Prior, 192 Vt. 249, 58 A.3d 200 (2012).

       <p>
        In an action by a mother and father, on behalf of themselves and their son, against a high school district, a union, and a State Department of Education, a district court correctly concluded that the mother's defamation of character claim, brought on behalf of herself, was barred by the three-year statute of limitations under 12 V.S.A.
        ยง
        512(3) because that claim accrued over three years earlier when the alleged defamatory statements were made. Tindall v. Poultney High Sch. Dist., 414 F.3d 281 (2d Cir. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Accrual of a cause of action in defamation may be deferred until the plaintiff discovers or, through the exercise of reasonable care and diligence, should have discovered the nature of the defamatory communication. Dulude v. Fletcher Allen Health Care, Inc., 174 Vt. 74, 807 A.2d 390 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        The limitations period for an action for personal injury starts to run when the plaintiff should have discovered (1) the injury, (2) its cause, and (3) the existence of a cause of action. Soutiere v. Betzdearborn, Inc., 189 F. Supp. 2d 183 (D. Vt. 2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute of limitations did not bar an action claiming that the plaintiffs sustained neurological injury from their use of and exposure to polyacrylamide flocculents in the course of their employment where the plaintiffs did not dispute that they were aware of their injuries more than three years before the commencement of the action, but it did not appear that they knew the cause of their injuries more than three years before the commencement of the action, although they had an unsubstantiated suspicion of the cause. Soutiere v. Betzdearborn, Inc., 189 F. Supp. 2d 183 (D. Vt. 2002).

        Plaintiff's complaint that, as a result of tortious interference with contract, she "suffered severe physical and emotional health problems and was forced to resign her position, under duress" was properly characterized as alleging personal injuries, and the fact that some economic losses were also alleged did not alter the underlying nature of her claim so that the three-year statute of limitations governed, and the claim was time barred.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Doctrine of equitable estoppel did not preclude defendant ski resort from invoking applicable one-year statute of limitations, since injured skier's attorney acted unreasonably in allowing limitations period to expire without confirming that defendant was willing to waive or extend period while parties continued settlement negotiations; defendant's insurance adjuster did not have superior knowledge of applicable limitations period, and it was the responsibility of skier's attorney, not defendant's adjuster, to be aware of period and ensure that his client's claims did not expire.

       <p>
        Statute of limitations governing injured skier's claims against ski resort was not equitably tolled, as it was not reasonable for skier's attorney to forego filing suit in hope of a settlement that was never promised by defendant's insurance adjuster, nor did defendant actively mislead plaintiff or prevent plaintiff in some extraordinary way from filing a timely lawsuit. Beecher v. Stratton Corp., 170 Vt. 137, 743 A.2d 1093 (1999).

        Where in an action against a sheriff for default of his deputy it appeared that owing to failure of deputy to return plaintiff's writ of attachment, another creditor obtained priority over plaintiff, his cause of action arose at time of deputy's failure seasonably to return the writ, and four-year limitation prescribed by this section then began to run, notwithstanding plaintiff's damages could not then be determined because of pendency of prior attachment.

        Cancer is not, in and of itself, a "noxious agent" under the so-called "latent injury" exception to the medical malpractice statute of limitations because an "agent" was something that acted upon the body, causing a disease or illness such as cancer. Thus, the exception did not apply, and plaintiff's malpractice action was time-barred. Campbell v. Stafford, 189 Vt. 567, 15 A.3d 126 (mem.) (2011).

        In medical malpractice actions, the question of when the injury was or reasonably should have been discovered for purposes of statute of limitations is one of fact to be determined by the jury. Lillicrap v. Martin, 156 Vt. 165, 591 A.2d 41 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court applied incorrect legal standard and thereby invaded province of the jury where it determined in medical malpractice action that discovery of the injury occurred when plaintiff discovered he suffered from a disorder, not when he also discovered the cause of the disorder.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff's medical malpractice action arose prior to enactment of repose provision of statute of limitations, application of the provision deprived plaintiff of due process because it foreclosed all manner of redressing the violation of his vested rights.

       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse its discretion when it allowed physicians to amend their answer on the sixth day of trial so as to affirmatively plead the statute of limitation; record indicated that trial court exercised its discretion carefully and that it thoughtfully considered the policy objectives of the rule, balancing the right of the defendants to present their defense based upon the statute of limitations on its merits, rather than being precluded from doing so because of a procedural technicality, against the right of the plaintiff to be provided with adequate notice of the defense.

        Cancer is not, in and of itself, a "noxious agent" under the so-called "latent injury" exception to the medical malpractice statute of limitations because an "agent" was something that acted upon the body, causing a disease or illness such as cancer. Thus, the exception did not apply, and plaintiff's malpractice action was time-barred. Campbell v. Stafford, 189 Vt. 567, 15 A.3d 126 (mem.) (2011).

        Nothing in the statutory language of this section suggests that the Legislature intended to exclude nonperpetrators from the reach of the statute; the use of the word "act" in different contexts in different sentences of the statute does not compel the conclusion that the act complained of must always be the act of sexual abuse itself. Sabia v. State, 164 Vt. 293, 669 A.2d 1187 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff's allegations of childhood sexual abuse occurring forty years in the past were not subject to dismissal on statute of limitations grounds; Legislature had related limitations provision available as a model when it enacted this section, and it could be inferred that Legislature intentionally omitted the "or reasonably should have been discovered" language from this section, leaving only the notion of actual discovery.

        Plaintiff's claim against state agency, for failing to prevent
    foster child from sexually abusing him, fell within category of cases intended to be covered by statute of limitations governing actions based on childhood sexual abuse. Earle v. State, 170 Vt. 183, 743 A.2d 1101 (1999).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        For purposes of retroactivity provision of statute of limitations governing actions based on childhood sexual abuse, a plaintiff's simple awareness of injury or condition resulting from abuse marks date for determining whether plaintiff's claim falls within period of retroactive application. Earle v. State, 170 Vt. 183, 743 A.2d 1101 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        In action against state agency for negligence in failing to protect plaintiff from sexual abuse, trial court erred in equating date of accrual under applicable statute of limitations with date of discovery that determined whether plaintiff's claim fell within statute's retroactivity period. Earle v. State, 170 Vt. 183, 743 A.2d 1101 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in failing to apply retroactivity provision of statute of limitations governing cases of childhood sexual abuse, since it was possible, under facts alleged in case, that it was sometime after July 1, 1984 when plaintiff first discovered that his "injury or condition" was caused by act of sexual abuse, and for court to decide that delayed psychological trauma deriving from childhood sexual assault was not a distinct "injury or condition" would render text of retroactivity provision meaningless. Earle v. State, 170 Vt. 183, 743 A.2d 1101 (1999).

        Court declines to follow decisions holding that a plaintiff alleging sexual abuse is, as a matter of law, on inquiry notice of the potential liability of a defendant based on the knowledge that the perpetrator was a priest in the employ of a church.

       <p>
        When a former patient alleged that her surgeon had sexually assaulted her under the guise of treating her when she was a teenager, it was error to hold that her suit was time-barred, as a reasonable jury could conclude that even though she suspected that the surgeon had examined her to satisfy his sexual desires rather than treat her hip/groin injury, she did not and could not have reasonably discovered the alleged legal injury until she learned through media reports that the surgeon had been charged with assaulting other women in a similar manner. A reasonable jury could come to such a conclusion by considering the position of trust and authority established by the surgeon as the patient's longstanding doctor, the fact that the patient was being treated for an injury near an intimate part of her body, and the lack of a response from the patient's family affirming her vacillating concerns about the surgeon's methods of examination and treatment. Clarke v. Abate, 194 Vt. 294, 80 A.3d 578 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Surgeon could not prevail on the grounds that a former patient failed to challenge his statement of undisputed facts insofar as the court had ruled that those statements were insufficient to support the trial court's summary judgment ruling in favor of the surgeon based on the patient's alleged acknowledgement of defendant's wrongful conduct. The patient never conceded that she knew or should have known of the wrongfulness of the surgeon's conduct, which was the ultimate factual question for the jury to resolve in determining whether the statute of limitations had run. Clarke v. Abate, 194 Vt. 294, 80 A.3d 578 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        By acknowledging, in response to the court's questioning, that a patient had concerns early on about the appropriateness of her surgeon's examinations, the patient's counsel did not concede that the patient had knowledge sufficient to trigger the running of the applicable statute of limitations. Clarke v. Abate, 194 Vt. 294, 80 A.3d 578 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was not entitled to summary judgment or judgment as a matter of law under the statute prescribing the limitations period for actions based on childhood sexual abuse. Plaintiff linked his long-term mental health issues to the conduct of defendant's priest in 2002 or 2004, well after the 1984 cut-off date in the retroactivity provision; while defendant could point to other evidence that might support its view that plaintiff was aware or should have been aware much earlier, at best there was a genuine issue of material fact that precluded grant of summary judgment, and there was a legally sufficient basis for the jury to find for plaintiff on the issue. Turner v. Roman Catholic Diocese of Burlington, 186 Vt. 396, 987 A.2d 960 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in granting plaintiff judgment as a matter of law under the statute prescribing the limitations period for actions based on childhood sexual abuse. A priest's position in defendant's diocese, and the evidence that plaintiff knew that the priest had abused others, were sufficient for the jury to find that plaintiff was on inquiry notice from those facts, and to conclude that the time for filing an action against defendant had commenced. Turner v. Roman Catholic Diocese of Burlington, 186 Vt. 396, 987 A.2d 960 (2009).

       <p>
        If disability does not exist at time cause of action accrues, subsequent intervening of disability does not prevent running of statute. Lincoln v. Norton, 36 Vt. 679 (1864); Tracy v. Atherton, 36 Vt. 503 (1864), same case 35 Vt. 52, 171 A.L.R. 1281, 1286.

        In an action of trover where statute was pleaded, replication alleging insanity of plaintiff and that plaintiff was under guardianship after the cause of action accrued was insufficient. Lincoln v. Norton, 36 Vt. 679 (1864).
       </p>
       <p>
        To save operation of statute of limitations in regard to real estate, disability must exist in heir at the time right or title first descends to him, and hence successive disabilities, though existing in same person, cannot exempt his right from operation of statute.

        Because the Dram Shop Act contains its own limitations provision and is not codified in the chapter governing limitation of actions, an action under the Dram Shop Act is "otherwise specially limited" and removed from the operation of the minority tolling provision by the statute stating that provisions of the chapter governing limitation of actions "shall not affect an action otherwise specially limited by law."

       </h5>
       <p>
        Statute of limitations was not tolled by plaintiff's alleged inability to manage her affairs. Whatever psychological distress she might have suffered, the trial court found that the record indisputably showed an intense, prolonged involvement by plaintiff in pursuing her rights which was fundamentally inconsistent with the claim that her psychological condition impaired her ability to protect her legal interests. Eaton v. Prior, 192 Vt. 249, 58 A.3d 200 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court applied erroneous legal standard in determining that plaintiff was not "insane" for purposes of tolling the statute of limitations where it made only passing reference to plaintiff's ability "to make decisions about her life" and instead focused principally on evidence normally associated with the higher standard for criminal insanity, such as the absence of a "major mental illness" or "psychosis." Fila v. Spruce Mountain Inn, 178 Vt. 323, 885 A.2d 723 (August 5, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section requires more than a mental impairment affecting solely the lawsuit in issue for the statute of limitations to be tolled by plaintiff's insanity. Goode v. State, 150 Vt. 651, 553 A.2d 142 (mem.) (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since plaintiff could handle every aspect of his life, including business and legal responsibilities, except those connected with his lawsuit, trial court correctly found that plaintiff was not insane within the meaning of this section. Goode v. State, 150 Vt. 651, 553 A.2d 142 (mem.) (1988).

        Long arm statute, as amended in 1968 to permit service of process outside the State for personal judgment actions, did not supersede the 1961 amendment to the statute allowing service via the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles. Accordingly, the three-year statute of limitations was tolled when defendant resided out of state for the entire period and had no property in Vermont. Andrews v. Stam, 182 Vt. 482, 939 A.2d 455 (2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where debtor's absence is coupled with residence out of State it comes within second provision of this section, and fact that he was absent from and resided out of State when the right of action accrued does not take it out of that provision. Bethel Mills, Inc. v. Whitcomb, 116 Vt. 357, 76 A.2d 548 (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mere absence from State will not prevent operation of statute while debtor retains residence in it by which process may be served upon him. Hall v. Nasmith, 28 Vt. 791 (1856); Davis v. Marshall, 37 Vt. 69 (1864); Rutland Marble Co. v. Bliss, 57 Vt. 23 (1885).
       </p>
       <p>
        If debtor has his fixed residence out of State, all of his absences from State are to be deducted from time during which statute would otherwise be running. Hall v. Nasmith, 28 Vt. 791 (1856).

       <p>
        If debtor residing out of State when cause of action accrues comes to dwell and reside permanently in state, it is not necessary that creditor have knowledge of this fact to set statute in operation; it is enough if he can acquire such knowledge by exercise of reasonable diligence.

         9. Cause of action accruing in another state.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Statute that tolls a cause of action after its accrual while defendant is out of the State and does not own property in Vermont that can be attached excludes causes of action accruing in other states, so long as the parties to the accruing cause are residents of that state. Marine Midland Bank v. Bicknell, 176 Vt. 389, 848 A.2d 1134 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because plaintiff's cause of action accrued when the parties were New York residents, the exception provided for in the tolling statute applied to the action. Marine Midland Bank v. Bicknell, 176 Vt. 389, 848 A.2d 1134 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Purpose of the exception in the statute that tolls a cause of action after its accrual while defendant is out of the State is to prevent a plaintiff from failing to act when he could have done so in the foreign state. Marine Midland Bank v. Bicknell, 176 Vt. 389, 848 A.2d 1134 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where cause of action accrued in another state and parties thereto resided in such state at the time, statute of limitations applies; provisions of this section not extending to such case. Wetmore's Adm'r v. Karrick, 95 Vt. 318, 115 A. 234 (1921).
       </p>
       <p>
        Term "residents" in last clause of this section means persons having such residence in such other state at time of accruing of cause of action that legal service of process could have been made upon them. Trask v. Karrick, 94 Vt. 70, 108 A. 846 (1919), same case 87 Vt. 451, 89 A. 472, 148 A.L.R. 734, 747.
       </p>
       <p>
        Where parties resided in Massachusetts at time note was executed, but at time of maturity maker had neither abode nor property in that state, this section applied and maker's absence from this State prevented running of statute. Trask v. Karrick, 94 Vt. 70, 108 A. 846 (1919), same case 87 Vt. 451, 89 A. 472, 148 A.L.R. 734, 747.

        Limitations period was not tolled by appellant's 2011 incarceration, as it occurred after the cause of action had accrued, or under the fraudulent concealment statute, as the alleged fraud appellant asserted would have occurred years after the cause of action accrued and thus did not prevent him from discovering it.

        Any claim of fraudulent concealment was subsumed within the central preliminary question disputed by the parties, ruled on by the trial court, and to be considered by the jury on remand: when a patient should have known that her surgeon was sexually assaulting her instead of treating her.

       </p>
       <p>
        There was no merit to defendants' argument that a trustee's fraudulent concealment of material facts tolled the limitations period on their conflict of interest/self-dealing counterclaim. There was no concealment of the trustee's ownership, or her status as beneficiary and trustee, or of her desire for ownership of the remainder of the property in question, and those were the material facts to be known.

       </p>
       <p>

       <p>
        In action for breach of express and implied warranties arising from sale of dairy cattle in which plaintiffs also alleged fraudulent misrepresentation as to the condition of the cattle on the part of the defendants, the question of whether the statute of limitations was tolled by the fraudulent concealment of the defendants was a question for the trier of fact, and it was therefore improper, as a matter of law, to grant summary judgment for the defendants on the ground that the action was barred by the statute of limitations. Aube v. O'Brien, 140 Vt. 1, 433 A.2d 298 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was for the jury to determine, in deciding whether plaintiff had been prevented by defendant's fraudulent concealment of his cause of action from instituting suit under wrongful death and survival statutes, if defendant had actual knowledge of the fact that a contraceptive pill, which was being taken by plaintiff's wife at the time of her gall bladder operation, caused blood clots and then concealed the fact from the plaintiff. Merrill v. Reville, 135 Vt. 517, 380 A.2d 96 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        If properly pleaded, fraudulent concealment can vitiate the statutory bar of the limitations defense. South Burlington School District v. Goodrich, 135 Vt. 601, 382 A.2d 220 (1977), overruled on other grounds, University of Vermont v. W.R. Grace Co. (1989) 152 Vt. 287, 565 A.2d 1354.

       </p>
       <p>
        Although general rule is that fraudulent concealment of cause of action which will postpone running of statute of limitations must consist of some affirmative act, concealment of facts by one whose duty it is to disclose them is deemed to be fraudulent. Troy v. American Fidelity Co., 120 Vt. 410, 143 A.2d 469 (1958).
       </p>

        Concealment of cause of action that tolls statute must be fraudulent and with design to prevent discovery of facts which give rise to action. Estate of Delligan, 111 Vt. 227, 13 A.2d 282 (1940), same case 110 Vt. 294, 6 A.2d 1, 173 A.L.R. 581, 55 A.L.R.2d 239, 63 Harv. L.Rev. 1221.
       </p>
       <p>
        While some material fact must be concealed by positive or affirmative act as distinguished from mere silence, it is immaterial whether concealment precedes, is concurrent with, or subsequent to, beginning of cause of action; and fraud by which concealment is accomplished need not be other than that which constitutes cause of action, if it actually has such effect. Watts v. Mulliken's Est., 95 Vt. 335, 115 A. 150 (1921).
       </p>
       <p>
        Effect of original fraud, whether operating to conceal cause of action or not, is controlling factor when defendant does no more than to remain silent, and it is duty of defendant to disclose a breach of trust or confidence, his mere silence, if it conceals facts, is an affirmative act postponing running of statute of limitations. Watts v. Mulliken's Est., 95 Vt. 335, 115 A. 150 (1921).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute does not run against an equity founded upon subsisting trust, nor against an equity founded on fraud, while person against whom equity is claimed keeps fraud concealed from party claiming equity. Payne v. Hathaway, 3 Vt. 212 (1831).

         1. Applicability.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Statute pertaining to the death of a party applies to causes of action that exist before a decedent's death - causes that could be brought by him or against him while he was alive. From a plain-language reading of the text, it does not apply to causes of action that accrue after death. Benson v. MVP Health Plan, Inc., 186 Vt. 97, 978 A.2d 33 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute pertaining to the death of a party applies only "if the cause of action survives"; the legislature's use of the word "survives" indicates that it intended to craft a statute of limitations for certain survival actions. Survival actions are generally understood to be lawsuits on behalf of a decedent's estate for injuries or damages incurred by the deceased before dying, and do not include causes of action accruing to an estate after a decedent's death. Benson v. MVP Health Plan, Inc., 186 Vt. 97, 978 A.2d 33 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plain language of the statute pertaining to the death of a party establishes a limitations period only for causes of action that could have been brought by or against the deceased during his lifetime and does not apply to causes of action by or against an estate that accrue after the decedent's death. Accordingly, the trial court erred in concluding that an administrator's claim against an insurer that accrued after the decedent's death was barred by the statute. Benson v. MVP Health Plan, Inc., 186 Vt. 97, 978 A.2d 33 (2009).

        This section is a true statute of limitations, purpose of which is to make necessary the bringing of an action within a reasonable time and thus prevent fraudulent and stale claims from being brought at a time when witnesses have died or disappeared and documentary evidence has been lost or destroyed.

        Although defendant included "[s]tatute of [l]imitations" in a list of seven "affirmative defenses" set forth in his answer, the statute he relies upon on appeal, the two-year statute of limitations for survival actions, was never asserted below and the bare assertion of an intention to raise the statute of limitations is insufficient to preserve the defense where defendant failed to identify either the statute of limitations upon which he relied or the count to which it applied.

        In dispute over whether tort action was timely brought, this section did not deny plaintiff due process of law by not providing actual notice to tort claimants of triggering of two-year limitations period, where diligent plaintiffs would not fail to discover a potential defendant's death during the statute's time limit, and the state's interest in preventing stale claims was too great.

        ยง
        4), and with some additions has been law of this state for more than one hundred fifty years. Hayden v. Caledonia Nat'l Bank, 112 Vt. 491, 28 A.2d 389 (1942), same case 112 Vt. 30, 20 A.2d 675, 142 A.L.R. 1178.

       <p>
        This section has no application to subject of jurisdiction, but is simply a modification of statute of limitations. Goff v. Robinson, 60 Vt. 633, 15 A. 339 (1888), same case 62 Vt. 60, 19 A. 993.

       <p>
        Presenting of claim to commissioners was beginning of new suit within this section and would avoid effect of statute of limitations if made within one year from time when former suit was discontinued by appointment of such commissioners. Walker v. Wooster's Adm'r, 61 Vt. 403, 17 A. 792 (1889).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where action failed on account of neglect of magistrate to appear with writ at time and place of trial, and plaintiff brought another action within year, statute of limitations would not be a bar to the suit. Spear v. Curtis, 40 Vt. 59 (1867).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff brought suit before justice of peace, who once continued cause, and was absent at second time appointed, by which suit was necessarily discontinued, he could bring another suit within one year after such discontinuance, and statute of limitations would not be a bar to suit, unless cause of action had become barred before commencement of former action.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Where action was dismissed because service was not made within required time after filing of complaint, statutory limitation period for the action passed, and a new complaint was filed, new complaint was not saved by this section, for plaintiff had burden to see that service was made and failed to do so. Weisburgh v. McClure Newspapers, Inc., 136 Vt. 594, 396 A.2d 1388 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Suit is commenced within meaning of this section when writ is issued for purpose of having it served and proceeded with though writ fails of service or sufficient service, provided service fails through unavoidable accident. Hayden v. Caledonia Nat'l Bank, 112 Vt. 491, 28 A.2d 389 (1942), same case 112 Vt. 30, 20 A.2d 675, 142 A.L.R. 117; Tracy v. Grand Trunk Ry., 76 Vt. 313, 57 A. 104 (1903).
       </p>
       <p>
        Writ "fails of sufficient service," within this section, when there is an utter failure of service. Tracy v. Grand Trunk Ry., 76 Vt. 313, 57 A. 104 (1903).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence tended to show that failure of service in question resulted from "unavoidable accident" within this section. Tracy v. Grand Trunk Ry., 76 Vt. 313, 57 A. 104 (1903).
       </p>
       <p>
        Replication to statute of limitations setting forth that previous suit was seasonably begun, but that writ in such suit was not duly served, should allege that such failure of service was due to unavoidable accident or to fault or neglect of the officer serving the same.

         6. Abatement of writ.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        This section is clear as to when a plaintiff has the right to bring a new action for the same cause and is not susceptible of exceptions, conditions or requirements by which its saving provisions would be forfeited. Leno v. Meunier, 125 Vt. 30, 209 A.2d 485 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        Language of this section infers that when writ is abated for any cause there has been an "action commenced" within the meaning of section, otherwise there would be no writ to be abated. Hayden v. Caledonia Nat'l Bank, 112 Vt. 491, 28 A.2d 389 (1942), same case 112 Vt. 30, 20 A.2d 675, 142 A.L.R. 1178.
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not enough to allege that former suit was abated for defective service and present suit brought within a year from such abatement, but it must further appear that cause of defective service was within statute. Scott v. School Dist. No. 9, 67 Vt. 150, 31 A. 145 (1894).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Suit tried on merits, and questions involved, whether of law or fact, finally determined, cannot be said to have failed for matter of form because plaintiff omitted therein to rely on other facts available to him. Johnson v. Wells-Lamson Quarry Co., 103 Vt. 475, 156 A. 681 (1931).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defeat because of variance between allegations and proof, or failure to support action by evidence because of an averment that makes some fact material which would otherwise be immaterial was not defeat for "matter of form." Kent v. Batchelder, 88 Vt. 563, 93 A. 264 (1915); Poland v. Grand Trunk Ry., 47 Vt. 73 (1874).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not extend to case where first suit was terminated by nonsuit occasioned by inability of plaintiff, through poverty, to comply seasonably with order that plaintiff furnish additional security for defendant's costs. Hayes v. Stewart, 23 Vt. 622 (1851).

        Where plaintiff was at law, driven to nonsuit by decision of court that form of action could not be sustained, he could commence another action in one year from the termination of that action before the statute of limitations would run at law. Spear & Carlton v. Newell, 13 Vt. 288 (1841).

         10. Arrest of judgment.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where judgment of Supreme Court compelled plaintiffs to elect either to amend their declaration and have new trial on terms imposed, or to have judgment arrested, their election to submit to an arrest of judgment was not voluntary, and therefore did not bar new action for the same cause within year. Baker v. Sherman, 77 Vt. 167, 59 A. 167 (1904), same case 71 Vt. 439, 46 A. 57, 75 Vt. 88, 53 A. 330.
       </p>
       <p>
        Rejoinder, which admitted that suit terminated in an arrest of judgment as set forth in replication to plea of statute of limitations, but alleged that such termination resulted from voluntary action of plaintiff, was a plea of avoidance and did not amount to general denial. Baker v. Sherman, 75 Vt. 88, 53 A. 330 (1902), same case 71 Vt. 439, 46 A. 57, 73 Vt. 26, 50 A. 633, 77 Vt. 167, 59 A. 167.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Failure to file a certificate of merit does not divest the court of its general power to hear a medical malpractice action. Thus, the dismissal of plaintiff's case for failing to file a certificate of merit was not a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and plaintiff's claim was not protected by the statute governing a new action after the failure of the original action. Quinlan v. Five-town Health Alliance, Inc., 207 Vt. 503, 192 A.3d 390 (May 18, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where first suit dismissed for lack of jurisdiction was brought in federal court the plaintiff may begin a new suit in state court pursuant to this section. Leno v. Meunier, 125 Vt. 30, 209 A.2d 485 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section providing that a new action may be begun within a stated time if the first action was brought within the period of limitations and was dismissed on a ground not affecting the merits is applicable to suits dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. Leno v. Meunier, 125 Vt. 30, 209 A.2d 485 (1965).

       <p>
        Voluntary part payment of debt, whether barred by statute or not, if made without protestation of further liability, is recognition of such debt by debtor, from which law not only implies an admission of balance as a subsisting debt, but also promise to pay it which prevents operation of statute. Putnam v. Swain, 102 Vt. 90, 146 A. 6 (1929); Fletcher v. Brainerd, 75 Vt. 300, 55 A. 608 (1903); Corliss v. Grow, 58 Vt. 702, 2 A. 388 (1886).
       </p>
       <p>
        Payment that will operate to revive a debt barred by statute of limitations must be a voluntary one and made with the intent that it should be applied upon such debt. Austin v. McClure, 60 Vt. 453, 15 A. 161 (1888).
       </p>
       <p>
        Payment made by assignee under order of court in proceeding in insolvency would not interrupt the running of the statute of limitations, although United States bankrupt act was in force at time. Benton v. Holland, 58 Vt. 533, 3 A. 322 (1886).
       </p>
       <p>
        When surety paid money, which he had received in presence of payee from principal on note, it was question of intent, in its effect on statute of limitations, whether he paid it as agent of principal, or for himself, and if it was understanding of all parties that surety was acting for himself, it was payment by him, and removed statute bar as to him. Green v. Morris, 58 Vt. 35, 4 A. 561 (1886).

       </h5>
       <p>
        When debtor makes payment to one who holds several demands against him without specifying on which debt it is to be applied, creditor may generally apply it on whichever he chooses. Putnam v. Swain, 102 Vt. 90, 146 A. 6 (1929); McDowell v. McDowell's Est., 75 Vt. 401, 56 A. 98 (1903).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where debtor furnished to one or two partners an article for his own use, which was credited upon partnership debt by the other partner at direction of first, given in presence of debtor and without objection on his part, it would operate as payment upon partnership indebtedness within statute of limitations. Cuthbertson v. Hill, 65 Vt. 573, 27 A. 71 (1893).
       </p>
       <p>
        Payments not made upon general account, but to apply upon specific items, do not prevent operation of statute of limitations. Hicks' Est. v. Blanchard, 60 Vt. 673, 15 A. 401 (1888); Harris v. Howard, 56 Vt. 695 (1884).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where one owed another an individual and a partnership account, and made general payments, without any application, without protestation against further liability, and payments amounted to more than individual account, law upon principles of equity would apply balance on partnership account, which would remove bar of statute of limitations, although creditor, without definite knowledge of standing of two accounts, gave debtor credit for all payments on his individual account.

        Payment by mortgagor within fifteen years prevented running of statute as to entire premises, notwithstanding mortgagor, to knowledge of mortgagee, had conveyed a portion of same to a third party, who had been in the exclusive occupancy thereof for more than fifteen years, without making any payment upon or otherwise recognizing mortgage debt. Kendall v. Tracy, 64 Vt. 522, 24 A. 1118 (1892).
       </p>
       <p>
        Payment of interest or part of principal of mortgage debt by one of several parties who were interested in an equity of redemption, and who had constructive notice, repelled presumption that mortgage had been paid, and took case out of operation of statute of limitations, not only as to payer, but as to all owners of equity. Hollister v. York, 59 Vt. 1, 9 A. 2 (1886).
       </p>
       <p>
        The payment of interest on mortgage debt, by mortgagor, or of any portion of principal, would be sufficient to repel presumption of payment and take case out of operation of statute. Martin v. Bowker, 19 Vt. 526 (1847).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Mere fact that note bears an indorsement of payment thereon, without any evidence tending to show to whom, or by whom, the payment was made, or who wrote indorsement, is not sufficient to prevent running of the statute of limitations. Crahan v. Chittenden, 82 Vt. 410, 74 A. 86 (1909); Cleveland v. Dinsmore, 59 Vt. 436, 8 A. 279 (1887).
       </p>
       <p>
        Indorsement on promissory note, "Paid on this note, March 11, 1882, ten dollars," signed by maker, was sufficient written acknowledgment to interrupt running of statute, although no payment was in fact made. Gay's Est. v. Hassom, 64 Vt. 495, 24 A. 715 (1892).
       </p>
       <p>
        Indorsement upon note, though not in handwriting of payor, was some, but not sufficient evidence of payment, and could be weighed in determining whether payment in fact had been made. Lawrence v. Graves' Est., 60 Vt. 657, 15 A. 342 (1888); Bailey v. Danforth, 53 Vt. 504 (1881).
       </p>
       <p>
        Language used in this section implies that such indorsement may be weighed in determining whether payment has been made on note, though not of itself sufficient to establish payment. Bailey v. Danforth, 53 Vt. 504, 922, 934 (1881).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is intended thereby to cut off establishment of payment from indorsement alone, unless proved to be made in handwriting of party making payment. Bailey v. Danforth, 53 Vt. 504, 922, 934 (1881).
       </p>
       <p>
        Its weight, as evidence, depends upon fact, whether it was made long before, or after, statute had run on note; whether for, or against, interest of owner of note, to have made it. Bailey v. Danforth, 53 Vt. 504, 922, 934 (1881).

        Indorsements in handwriting of payee without direction, authority, or knowledge of defendant, made as representing items of credit owing by payee to defendant as of dates of such indorsements, where there was unsettled book account between parties as well as another note not in issue and not affected by statute, were not sufficient proof of payment to toll statute. Putnam v. Swain, 102 Vt. 90, 146 A. 6 (1929).
       </p>
       <p>
        On issue whether certain payment had been made within statutory period, original note having been stolen, admission of copy of note and indorsements thereon made by payee was proper when received not as independent evidence but rather as memorandum in connection with payee's testimony respecting payment, statute not excluding such use of an indorsement or memorandum of payment. Bennett v. Delphia, 98 Vt. 492, 129 A. 234 (1924).
       </p>
       <p>
        An indorsement on a note, in handwriting of the payee, is some evidence of such payment, though made after statute has run. McDowell v. McDowell's Est., 75 Vt. 401, 56 A. 98 (1903).

        Clerk of county court could sign writ returnable to that court in case where he was stockholder in corporation which was party to the suit. Insurance Co. v. Cummings, 11 Vt. 503 (1839).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that writ returnable to county court was signed by justice of peace, who was interested in event of suit, was no ground of abatement. Graham v. Todd, 9 Vt. 166 (1837).

       <p>
        Where process is signed by one who has full authority to set legal procedure in motion and defendant is furnished all security for cost of prosecution to which he is entitled, mistaken identification of signer did not divest him of authority nor deprive process of legal effect. Jones v. Lavanway, 123 Vt. 284, 187 A.2d 346 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Signature of authority issuing writ merely to minute of recognizance at foot of writ was not sufficient signature of writ. Andrus v. Carroll, 35 Vt. 102 (1862).

        .
       </h5>
       <p>
        When constable, having writ of attachment for service, took receipt for attachable personal property in possession of debtor, it constituted sufficient attachment of property to hold receiptor, and if constable neglected to make proper return of attachment upon writ, he was liable in an action on the case for neglect. Howes v. Spicer, 23 Vt. 508 (1851).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where constable, not being misled by any instructions from plaintiff or his attorney, represented to plaintiff that he had made valid attachment, and thereby induced plaintiff to rely upon it and forego making any further attachment, constable was bound by such representation and was estopped from showing that in fact he made no legal attachment. Howes v. Spicer, 23 Vt. 508 (1851).
       </p>
       <p>
        Liability of constable was not affected by fact that creditor refused to receive receipt taken by the constable, and prosecute it at his own risk. Howes v. Spicer, 23 Vt. 508 (1851).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In action against constable for neglect to return execution against sheriff, instructions of plaintiff's attorney to constable were within his authority as attorney to give, and were sufficient to exonerate constable from liability for not returning the execution. Willard v. Goodrich, 31 Vt. 597 (1859).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Where, in action against constable for neglecting and refusing to serve writ placed in his hands for service, proof was that plaintiff's attorney went to defendant and "handed out" writ, saying he wanted it served immediately, but that defendant did not take it, but said he had other business to attend to, and could not serve it then, gravamen of declaration was defendant's refusal to perform his duty by serving writ, and there was therefore no variance.

         4. Levy.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where a judgment creditor informs the levying officer of existence and location of assets known to the creditor and gives the officer no further instructions, the officer must levy upon those assets or upon others; but where creditor gives officer specific instructions as to manner of levy and items to be seized, the officer must follow those directions when they are not in conflict with the law, and he is not bound to serve the writ in any other manner and ceases to be a public officer and becomes a private agent. Dowlings, Inc. v. Mayo, 137 Vt. 548, 409 A.2d 588 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where law enforcement officer received writ of execution and letter stating writ should be served at named person's restaurant and if he refused to pay the writ should be satisfied from the receipts in the cash register of the restaurant, the officer had only a duty to levy pursuant to the letter and court trying action against officer for failure and refusal to satisfy the writ erroneously found that officer had duty to levy against such goods, chattels and lands of debtor as he could find or levy upon the cash in the cash register. Dowlings, Inc. v. Mayo, 137 Vt. 548, 409 A.2d 588 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff instructed defendant constable to levy against cash register receipts should person against whom execution was directed refuse to pay, plaintiff was not, in action claiming constable refused and failed to levy, entitled to mandamus commanding constable to levy against the goods, chattels and lands of the person named in the execution, or against cash register receipts, as plaintiff had limited the duty of constable by limiting the levy instructions. Dowlings, Inc. v. Mayo, 137 Vt. 548, 409 A.2d 588 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where person granted writ of execution gives constable the writ and specific instructions concerning the levy and what to levy upon, person granted the writ has the burden of proving constable was not influenced by the instructions where he claims failure or refusal to levy, and absent such a showing the constable is fully exonerated unless dereliction in performance of duty imposed by the limiting instructions is shown. Dowlings, Inc. v. Mayo, 137 Vt. 548, 409 A.2d 588 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff claiming failure and refusal to levy execution directed a levy upon cash register receipts should person levied against fail to pay, and in action against constable plaintiff failed to show there existed money in the cash register which belonged to person named in the writ and which could be levied against, constable could not be found in breach of his duty and mandamus would not be issued ordering him to serve the execution, nor was plaintiff entitled to damages. Dowlings, Inc. v. Mayo, 137 Vt. 548, 409 A.2d 588 (1979).

         1. Service.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        When no special instructions as to service of writ or execution are given, it is duty of officer to serve writ according to its precept. Gross v. Gates, 109 Vt. 156, 194 A. 465 (1937); Hill v. Pratt, 29 Vt. 119 (1856).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is his duty to attach property of debtor if any can be found by exercise of reasonable diligence, respecting ownership of which there is no reasonable doubt. Hill v. Pratt, 29 Vt. 119 (1856).
       </p>
       <p>
        Agreement by officer to serve a writ for less than legal fees would not vary his duty in this respect, and in an action against him for neglecting to attach property, testimony showing such an agreement was inadmissible. Hill v. Pratt, 29 Vt. 119 (1856).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sheriff cannot excuse himself from service of process because it is erroneous or irregular, but only when it is absolutely void. Stoddard v. Tarbell, 20 Vt. 321 (1848).
       </p>
       <p>
        Writ which has once been legally served, and which has then been altered by inserting different date and return day without the consent of defendant therein was not thereby rendered void, so as to excuse officer who served it originally from again making service of it, when delivered to him for that purpose subsequent to alteration. Stoddard v. Tarbell, 20 Vt. 321 (1848).
       </p>
       <p>
        An execution issued on judgment, after year and day, was not void, but voidable, merely, and sheriff was bound to execute it, and in an action against him for an escape, irregularity was no defense. Fletcher v. Mott, 1 Aik. 339 (1826).

         2. Return
        </b>
        .
       </h5>
       <p>
        To make "return according to law" is not only to return precept to authority that issued it, but also to return with it statement by officer of his doings in executing it, and that statement must recite substantially all of his doings within scope of proper execution of the process, and must show that he has faithfully obeyed every lawful command of process and of statute, otherwise return will be "undue," and insufficient for his protection. Gibson v. Holmes, 78 Vt. 110, 62 A. 11 (1905).
       </p>
       <p>
        Return of an officer on justice writ issued as capias: "I served this writ by arresting the body of the within named defendant, Burt Gibson, read the same in his hearing and this my return endorsed hereon," was insufficient, because it did not show how defendant was disposed of after arrest. Gibson v. Holmes, 78 Vt. 110, 62 A. 11 (1905).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Time when an execution is returned into office of clerk of the court from which it issued was one of the things required to be shown by return itself. Yatter v. Pitkin, 72 Vt. 255, 47 A. 787 (1900), same case 66 Vt. 300, 29 A. 370.
       </p>
       <p>
        Writ of execution could be executed on day on which it was returnable, and where body of debtor was committed to prison, it was not necessary that execution should be returned to proper office within its life, and no action on the case could be sustained by reason of its not being so returned. Fletcher v. Bradley, 12 Vt. 22 (1840).

         4. Special directions.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Party at whose instance writ or execution has issued, or his attorney, has right to give officer directions as to how it shall be executed, and officer is bound to follow such directions when not in conflict with law. Gross v. Gates, 109 Vt. 156, 194 A. 465 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        When party assumes to give special instructions to officer in regard to execution of process in his hands, different from his legal duty, officer ceases to be public officer, as to business so entrusted to him, and becomes private agent. Gross v. Gates, 109 Vt. 156, 194 A. 465 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        When party does not direct or control course of officer to whom writ or execution is given, nor ratify his acts, he is not liable for any wrong committed by officer. Gross v. Gates, 109 Vt. 156, 194 A. 465 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        When creditor in committing an execution to an officer, for collection, gives written instructions, and, on trial of an action against officer for neglect in collecting same, instructions are relied upon by way of defense, it is duty of court to direct jury in regard to legal effect of such instructions. Strongs v. Bradley, 14 Vt. 55 (1842), same case 13 Vt. 9.
       </p>
       <p>
        If such instructions would in any sense qualify conduct of officer, his acts must be referred to them, unless it be shown by positive proof that he was not influenced thereby. Strongs v. Bradley, 14 Vt. 55 (1842), same case 13 Vt. 9.

         5. Liability for false imprisonment.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        If process conforms in kind to that which the court has jurisdiction to issue, officer's liability for false imprisonment depends on whether there is a defect discoverable by an examination of the process itself; process which is not absolutely void on its face provides sufficient justification for the officer who serves it; if there is a defect apparent on its face which renders the process void, the officer is liable for an arrest made pursuant to such process. Horton v. Chamberlain, 152 Vt. 351, 566 A.2d 953 (1989).

        Where plaintiff claiming failure and refusal to levy execution directed a levy upon cash register receipts should person levied against fail to pay, and in action against constable plaintiff failed to show there existed money in the cash register which belonged to person named in the writ and which could be levied against, constable could not be found in breach of his duty and mandamus would not be issued ordering him to serve the execution, nor was plaintiff entitled to damages.

        Sheriff who received an execution in favor of private corporation of which he was member was not liable for neglecting to levy and return it, and it made no difference that he served original writ, in suit in which execution issued, by attaching property, and took receipt for the property and had prosecuted suit against receiptor to final judgment, which was unsatisfied by reason of insolvency of receiptor.

        </b>
        .
       </h5>
       <p>
        Justice form, of authorizing one to serve writ, did not confer sufficient authority to serve county court writ. Washburn v. Hammond, 25 Vt. 648 (1853).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not necessary to validity of authorization of an indifferent person to serve writ returnable to county court, that it should be stated in authorization, that known public officer could not seasonably be had, to serve writ. Culver v. Balch, 23 Vt. 618 (1851).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where justice writ directed, in body of it, to an indifferent person, named in form of deputation in county court writ, person so named would not be authorized to serve such writ. Edgerton v. Barrett, 21 Vt. 196 (1849).
       </p>
       <p>
        Special authorization of person to serve process, indorsed on back of writ, and signed by magistrate issuing it, in these words, - "I authorize A. B. to serve and return this according to law," - was sufficient, upon plea in abatement, as no uncertainty could exist, as to what was intended by pronoun this. Fullerton v. Briggs, 20 Vt. 542 (1848).
       </p>
       <p>
        County court had no power to permit magistrate, who signed writ, to amend direction, after the case had been entered in court, by inserting therein statutory reasons for making the authorization, and affidavit of magistrate, that he omitted requisite matter by mistake, could have no effect. Dolbear v. Hancock, 19 Vt. 388 (1847).
       </p>
       <p>
        Bill accompanied by ordinary subpoena, which, however, contained no direction to person delivering copy, was insufficient, and defendant was not affected by it. Bank of Burlington v. Catlin, 11 Vt. 106 (1839).
       </p>
       <p>
        Authorization need not mention particularly all such known officers as might legally serve writ if seasonably to be had. Bell v. Chipman, 2 Tyl. 423 (1803).

       <p>
        Appointment on blank writ was void, and those acting under it were trespassers. Ross v. Fuller, 12 Vt. 265 (1839); Kelly v. Paris, 10 Vt. 261 (1838).
       </p>

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Appointment of an indifferent person is a judicial act, which can be exercised only by the authority signing process. St. Johnsbury v. Goodenough, 44 Vt. 662 (1871); Dolbear v. Hancock, 19 Vt. 388 (1847); Ingraham v. Leland, 19 Vt. 304 (1847); Ross v. Fuller, 12 Vt. 265 (1839).
       </p>
       <p>
        It requires exercise of judicial discretion in adjudging that precept would fail of service for want of a proper legal officer, and in deciding upon person to serve it, hence authorization by magistrate who was counsel for one of parties would be invalid. St. Johnsbury v. Goodenough, 44 Vt. 662 (1871).

        Writ directed "to any sheriff or constable in the State or to George Brooks," without additional words, an indifferent person, would confer no authority upon person named to make service thereof. Brooks v. Farr, 51 Vt. 396 (1878).
       </p>
       <p>
        Authorization inserted in direction of county court writ in these words: "To C. H. Harding, an indifferent person, to serve and return," was sufficient. Bliss v. Smith, 42 Vt. 198 (1869).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is necessary to insert in writ name of person and that he is an indifferent person. Culver v. Balch, 23 Vt. 618 (1851).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where service was made by an indifferent person not named therein, defendant was not bound to notice it. Spafford v. Spafford, 16 Vt. 511 (1844); Allyn v. Davis, 10 Vt. 547 (1838).
       </p>
       <p>
        Citation directed to any indifferent person will not give proper notice when served by an indifferent person since no person is authorized to serve process of a court unless particularly named in such process. Moffat v. Moffat, 10 Vt. 432 (1838).

        If officer returned process satisfied, but without a detailed return of his doing thereon, and without an itemized minute of his fees, and retained his fees, execution debtor could recover their amount of him in assumpsit, or creditor of debtor could charge him therewith as trustee.

       <p>
        Question whether a Vermont court has jurisdiction over nonresident defendants is one of federal constitutional law requiring court to decide whether defendants have had sufficient minimum contacts with Vermont such that maintenance of suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice, and critical consideration is whether defendants' conduct and connections with forum state are such that they should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there; it is essential to a finding of personal jurisdiction that a defendant purposefully avails itself of privilege of conducting activities within forum state, thus invoking benefits and protections of its laws. Schwartz v. Frankenhoff, 169 Vt. 287, 733 A.2d 74 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Process may be validly served under this section only in an action or proceeding arising out of the contact with or activity in Vermont. Vermont Castings, Inc. v. Evans Products Co., 510 F. Supp. 940 (D. Vt. 1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Federal District Court was bound by State court construction of State's Long-Arm Statute. Braman v. Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital, 631 F.2d 6 (2d Cir. 1980).

        Where compliance with the procedural requirements of this section and
        ยง
        856 of this title involving service of process on foreign corporation by service on Vermont Secretary of State, with forwarding of process and return by registered mail to foreign corporation, were not questioned, reversal of order dismissing complaint for want of jurisdiction was required. Bard Bldg. Supply Co., Inc. v. United Foam Corp., 137 Vt. 125, 400 A.2d 1023 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The vital factor in determining the existence of jurisdiction of the person of the absent foreign corporation is the intentional and affirmative action on the part of the nonresident in pursuit of its corporate purposes within the jurisdiction and a single act, purposefully performed here, will put the actor within the reach of the sovereignty of this State, as will active participation in the Vermont market, either by direct shipment, or by way of transmittal through regular distributors presently serving the Vermont marketing area. O'Brien v. Comstock Foods, Inc., 123 Vt. 461, 194 A.2d 568 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        An essential jurisdictional factor cannot be supplied by speculation. O'Brien v. Comstock Foods, Inc., 123 Vt. 461, 194 A.2d 568 (1963).

         3. Minimal contacts.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Defendant's contacts with Vermont were sufficient to establish long-arm jurisdiction over it, where defendant was in the business of selling heavy equipment to a national market, it reached that market by advertising in a national trade journal, and equipment sale in question arose from contact made as a result of advertisement. Brown v. Cal Dykstra Equipment Co., 169 Vt. 636, 740 A.2d 793 (mem.) (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, by its terms, State service of process upon foreign corporations statute expressed policy to assert jurisdiction to full extent permitted by Due Process Clause of Fourteenth Amendment, issue of whether jurisdiction existed in case at hand was one of federal constitutional law, with basic test being that validity of service depends upon whether defendant has certain minimum contacts with Vermont such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice. Bard Bldg. Supply Co., Inc. v. United Foam Corp., 137 Vt. 125, 400 A.2d 1023 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The extent of participation in the Vermont market that will satisfy the elements of fair play and substantial justice is the essential element for exercise of jurisdiction over a foreign corporation by service on Vermont Secretary of State with forwarding of process and return by registered mail to foreign corporation. Bard Bldg. Supply Co., Inc. v. United Foam Corp., 137 Vt. 125, 400 A.2d 1023 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        While service pursuant to State statute is a permissible method of commencing actions in Federal District Courts, out-of-state defendants can be subjected to the reach of this section only in suits growing out of acts which have created essential contacts with the forum state. Anderson v. Abex Corp., 418 F. Supp. 5 (D. Vt.), aff'd, 539 F.2d 703 (2d Cir. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        As to both diversity and federal question jurisdiction of Federal District Court, in personam jurisdiction can be obtained over nonresident defendants by substituted service on the Vermont Secretary of State only if defendants had sufficient "minimal contacts" in Vermont. Anderson v. Abex Corp., 418 F. Supp. 5 (D. Vt.), aff'd, 539 F.2d 703 (2d Cir. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a substituted service action against a foreign corporation is dismissed for insufficient required minimal contacts to establish jurisdiction, the issue of the merits of personal jurisdiction has been decided, not the issue of the merits of the claim, and an assignee of plaintiff's claim misapprehends the law if he argues he is not bound by the dismissal because it was not on the merits; he can always sue in the state having sufficient contacts. Davis v. Saab Scania of Amer., Inc., 133 Vt. 317, 339 A.2d 456 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant Georgia corporation had subsidiaries and related corporations in Vermont and an airplane under its management and control flew into Vermont and was lost over Lake Champlain a few minutes after takeoff at Burlington, defendant would be deemed to be a foreign corporation doing business in Vermont and the contact and activity would support a personal judgment against it, under this statute, in suit by administrator of a passenger never found and presumed dead. Miller v. Cousins Properties, Inc., 378 F. Supp. 711 (D. Vt. 1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Persons who owned Georgia partnership which serviced plane which crashed in Vermont, whose only contact with owner of the plane was through the pilot and co-pilot, whose affidavit refuted the idea they knew or had good reason to know their service would have causative effect in Vermont and who were not told the plane was going to Vermont could not be sued in Vermont. Miller v. Cousins Properties, Inc., 378 F. Supp. 711 (D. Vt. 1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether a state has jurisdiction over the person of an absent foreign corporation, the "certain minimal contacts" which will permit the acquisition of such jurisdiction must afford a "substantial connection" with the state of the forum. O'Brien v. Comstock Foods, Inc., 123 Vt. 461, 194 A.2d 568 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont court is permitted to reach out-of-state defendants only in suits growing out of acts which have created contacts with Vermont, however limited or transient such contacts may be. Deveny v. Rheem Manufacturing Company, 319 F.2d 124 (2d Cir. 1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Manufacturer of water heaters who shipped them regularly to franchised dealer in Vermont who sold them to Vermont buyers had sufficient contact with Vermont to be subject to jurisdiction in Vermont under this section in suit by person injured by exploding heater.

        Collection in Vermont of the purchase price for goods sold to Vermont corporation by Pennsylvania corporation was a prime element of Pennsylvania corporation's intent to purposefully avail itself of the privilege of conducting activities within Vermont, thus involving the benefits and prohibitions of Vermont law; by C.O.D. shipment, Pennsylvania corporation, found subject to service of process by service on Vermont Secretary of State, with forwarding of process and return by registered mail to Pennsylvania corporation, made the carrier its agent for delivering the goods and collecting the price.

        Once the requisite contact and activity have been found on the part of foreign corporate defendant the question remains whether the litigation grew out of such contact and activity, and in this regard it was incumbent that the plaintiff demonstrate that the defendant was causally responsible for the presence of the injuring agency within this State. Huey v. Bates, 135 Vt. 160, 375 A.2d 987 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant's alleged contacts and activities within this jurisdiction, rather than being mere isolated acts which were unrelated to the plaintiff's causes of action, were integral and necessary acts from which the action arose, the required nexus had been shown between the facts underlying the causes of action and the defendant's alleged contacts and activities.

        Where shipment and ultimate sale of crawler-dozer in Vermont was direct result of foreign corporation's deliberate, knowing and purposeful utilization of its in-state distribution system, corporation's acts demonstrated a clear intention to actively participate in Vermont market and for purposes of wrongful death action arising out of fatal injury to person using vehicle manufactured by the corporation, it engaged in sufficient contact and activity to bring it within purview of this section.

        In suit by resident retired employee against defendant's employees retirement plan and its corporate and individual administrators for breach of fiduciary duties, breach of contract and violations of Welfare and Pension Disclosure Act, defendants' contacts and activities in Vermont, consisting at the most of three administrative letters mailed to plaintiff in Vermont, were not sufficient to warrant exercise of personal jurisdiction over defendants by courts of this State, and dismissal of action was required.

        Fact that nonresident corporation sold its product in Vermont did not give rise to cause of action by resident plaintiff suing defendant corporation's employees retirement plan and its nonresident corporate and individual administrators for breach of fiduciary duties, breach of contract and violations of Welfare and Pension Disclosure Act; thus court lacked personal jurisdiction over defendants under this section.

        In order for the long-arm of this section to reach defendant, plaintiff must show that conduct or activity of defendant in Vermont gave rise to the particular cause of action. Anderson v. Abex Corp., 418 F. Supp. 5 (D. Vt.), aff'd, 539 F.2d 703 (2d Cir. 1976).

        Fact that consequences of defendants' activities have been felt in Vermont, standing alone, is insufficient to sustain personal jurisdiction by Vermont Federal District Court. Anderson v. Abex Corp., 418 F. Supp. 5 (D. Vt.), aff'd, 539 F.2d 703 (2d Cir. 1976).

        Where Virginia residents bought an auto in Connecticut form a Connecticut dealer, and one defendant was a distributor with contacts with Vermont dealers and the other was distributor's parent corporation, suit for false representations, breach of warranty and negligence was not "action or proceeding against" defendants "arising or growing out of that conduct or activity" carried on in Vermont by defendants as required by this section.

        This section expressly permits service to be accomplished by delivery to the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles as attorney provided that a copy of the process is "sent", the statute doesn't say "delivered", by the plaintiff to the defendant. Proulx v. Goulet, 315 F. Supp. 622 (D. Vt. 1970).

        Provision that copy of process shall be sent by plaintiff to nonresident defendant is necessary part of such service to constitute due process of law under Fourteenth Amendment to Federal Constitution. Brammall v. LaRose, 105 Vt. 345, 165 A. 916 (1933).

       <p>
        Such act is ministerial one, not required to be done by plaintiff personally, manifest purpose of statute being to make it reasonably probable that defendant shall receive actual notice of pendency of action. Brammall v. LaRose, 105 Vt. 345, 165 A. 916 (1933).

       <p>
        Long arm statute, as amended in 1968 to permit service of process outside the State for personal judgment actions, did not supersede the 1961 amendment to the statute allowing service via the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles. Accordingly, the three-year statute of limitations was tolled when defendant resided out of state for the entire period and had no property in Vermont. Andrews v. Stam, 182 Vt. 482, 939 A.2d 455 (2007).

       <p>
        Because the trial court lacked sufficient evidence to determine whether plaintiff completed the requirements for substituted service by providing defendant driver with a copy of the return showing service on the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles, remand for further proceedings was necessary to enable the trial court to resolve the competing evidence regarding compliance.

        Personal jurisdiction over defendant horse sellers would not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice where defendants did not argue that Vermont was an inconvenient forum in which to try plaintiff's breach of warranty claim, horse's diseased condition was discovered in Vermont, and potential witnesses to horse's condition and expenses incurred were likely to be in Vermont. Dall v. Kaylor, 163 Vt. 274, 658 A.2d 78 (1995).

       <p>
        Vermont's long-arm statute has been interpreted as reflecting a clear policy allowing the State to assert jurisdiction over individual defendants to the full extent permitted by the Due Process Clause. Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. v. Robertson-Ceco Corp., 84 F.3d 560 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 519 U.S. 1006, 519 U.S. 1007, 117 S. Ct. 508, 136 L. Ed. 2d 398 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is hardly unfair for defendants to defend themselves in jurisdictions where they choose to advertise their products. Dall v. Kaylor, 163 Vt. 274, 658 A.2d 78 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where rule authorized service outside the state on "a person against whom a judgment for divorce or annulment of marriage is sought," but provided that a judgment so obtained "shall affect only the interest, title, right, or status in question," and this section authorized an in personam judgment based on out-of-state service in all instances where the minimum contacts test is met, rule and this section conflicted and this section controlled, and as a corollary, that portion of
        Emmons v. Emmons,
        124 Vt. 107, 197 A.2d 812 (1964), which suggests that, absent voluntary submission, only personal service in the State can confer sufficient jurisdiction to authorize an alimony award is no longer governing. Von Ohlsen v. Von Ohlsen, 137 Vt. 377, 406 A.2d 393 (1979).

        Presence in Vermont, of plane manufactured and originally sold by out-of-state corporation, was sufficient contact to permit service outside the state. Miller v. Cousins Properties, Inc., 378 F. Supp. 711 (D. Vt. 1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Persons who owned Georgia partnership which serviced plane which crashed in Vermont, whose only contact with owner of the plane was through the pilot and co-pilot, whose affidavit refuted the idea they knew or had good reason to know their service would have causative effect in Vermont and who were not told the plane was going to Vermont could not be sued in Vermont. Miller v. Cousins Properties, Inc., 378 F. Supp. 711 (D. Vt. 1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        An order of notice outside, by itself, cannot create in personam jurisdiction. Avery v. Bender, 126 Vt. 342, 230 A.2d 786 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        A denial of the order to vacate service would no more have conferred, by itself, personal jurisdiction not otherwise acquired, than could the order of notice outside the State create, by itself, in personam jurisdiction. Avery v. Bender, 126 Vt. 342, 230 A.2d 786 (1967).

        Defendants, who were in business of selling horses and who held themselves out as breeders and developers of world class horses, initiated business transaction with Vermont resident by advertising, more than one hundred times, in a national market that included Vermont, and, therefore, should have anticipated being sued in Vermont if dispute arose from these activities. Dall v. Kaylor, 163 Vt. 274, 658 A.2d 78 (1995).

         5. Minimal contacts.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In an action in which plaintiff, a Vermont corporation, asserted breach of contract and tort claims against defendants, a Canadian corporation and a Norwegian company, the exercise of specific personal jurisdiction over the Canadian corporation comported with 12 V.S.A.
        ยง
        913(b) and due process requirements because there was a significant degree of interrelationship between defendants such that the actions of the Norwegian company could be attributed to the Canadian corporation, and the formation of a contract for the purchase of helicopter engines from plaintiff was sufficient to reflect defendants' purposeful availment of the privilege of conducting activities within Vermont. Mansfield Heliflight, Inc. v. Heli-One Can. Inc., - F. Supp. 2d - (D. Vt. Sept. 28, 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a Vermont corporation's suit based upon a letter of intent and confidentiality agreement, personal jurisdiction existed over Pennsylvania corporations and officers because defendants, inter alia, engaged in active negotiations, visited the Vermont office, and allegedly engaged in tortious conduct. Country Home Prods. v. Schiller-Pfeiffer, Inc., 350 F. Supp. 2d 561 (D. Vt. Nov. 19, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the due process clause, court may assert personal jurisdiction only where defendant has certain minimum contacts with forum state such that maintenance of suit does not offend traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice, and contacts with State must be such that a defendant should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there. Artec Distributing, Inc. v. Video Playback, Inc., 799 F. Supp. 1558 (D. Vt. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Constitutional touchstone for establishing personal jurisdiction requires that defendant have established certain minimum contacts with forum state before court may assert personal jurisdiction, and determinative factor is foreseeability; defendant's conduct and connection with forum must be such that he should reasonably anticipate being haled into court there. Bechard v. Constanzo, 810 F. Supp. 579 (D. Vt. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        For court to assert in personam jurisdiction over a nonresident defendant, it is not necessary that cause of action being litigated arise out of contacts defendant has with forum state, if defendant has established sufficient contacts with jurisdiction in general; exercise of such general jurisdiction comports with due process when it is based on general business contacts which are continuous and systematic in nature. Bechard v. Constanzo, 810 F. Supp. 579 (D. Vt. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Nonresident surgeon and practice group did not have general business contacts with Vermont sufficient to confer general jurisdiction over them, where they were not licensed in Vermont, did not own property or maintain an office in Vermont, did not advertise or solicit business in Vermont, and only a small number of Vermont residents either occasionally went to Plattsburgh, New York for treatment or became ill while visiting and sought treatment on an emergency basis. Bechard v. Constanzo, 810 F. Supp. 579 (D. Vt. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no authority to support exercise of general personal jurisdiction over nonresident surgeon and practice group in absence of requisite minimum contacts, and argument was rejected that requiring defendants to defend malpractice action in Vermont would be reasonable and comport with fair play and substantial justice, where defendants could not have foreseen that their allegedly unintentional tortious conduct toward plaintiff, then a resident of New York, while treating plaintiff in New York, would have effects in Vermont. Bechard v. Constanzo, 810 F. Supp. 579 (D. Vt. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Nonresident defendants' mere purchase from and occasional return of products to Vermont video tape distributing company did not establish minimum contacts sufficient for court to exercise personal jurisdiction over them; defendants never affirmatively sought to do business with a Vermont corporation, but instead were solicited by the Vermont plaintiff. Artec Distributing, Inc. v. Video Playback, Inc., 799 F. Supp. 1558 (D. Vt. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Before a nonresident defendant can be brought into a Vermont court, the plaintiff must show that the Vermont long arm statute reaches the defendant, and that jurisdiction over him may be maintained without offending the due process clause. Northern Aircraft, Inc. v. Reed, 154 Vt. 36, 572 A.2d 1382 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        While service pursuant to state statute is a permissible method of commencing actions in Federal District Courts, out-of-state defendants can be subjected to the reach of this section only in suits growing out of acts which have created essential contacts with the forum state. Anderson v. Abex Corp., 418 F. Supp. 5 (D. Vt.), aff'd, 539 F.2d 703 (2d Cir. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        As to both diversity and federal question jurisdiction of Federal District Court, in personam jurisdiction can be obtained over nonresident defendants by substituted service on the Vermont Secretary of State only if defendants had sufficient "minimal contacts" in Vermont. Anderson v. Abex Corp., 418 F. Supp. 5 (D. Vt.), aff'd, 539 F.2d 703 (2d Cir. 1976).

        In this failure to warn and wrongful death action, the court allowed 30 days for discovery with respect to its potential jurisdiction over defendant seller where a Vermont-specific blog created the prospect of advertisements and other marketing efforts targeting this judicial district directly. Cernansky v. Lefebvre, 88 F. Supp. 3d 299 (D. Vt. 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Writ of mandamus directing dismissal of action against religious organization for lack of jurisdiction was warranted because District Court abused its discretion in finding organization "at home" in Vermont and irreparable harm that would result from allowing case to proceed constituted exceptional circumstances. Shovah v. Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany (in re Roman Catholic Diocese of Albany), 745 F.3d 30 (2d Cir. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Assuming that a Vermont company had shown the existence of "minimum contacts," the court was unconvinced that the nature and extent of the foreign corporation's activities were sufficiently continuous, systematic, and substantial to confer general jurisdiction, and therefore summary judgment was granted in favor of the foreign corporation. Hyperkinetics Corp. v. Flotec, Inc., - F. Supp. 2d - (D. Vt. Sept. 25, 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Standard for determining whether personal jurisdiction exists is whether defendant has committed intentional and affirmative action constituting active planned participation in Vermont market, and court will look to whether defendant has engaged in general course of conduct purposefully directed toward Vermont and inevitably affecting persons in State. Artec Distributing, Inc. v. Video Playback, Inc., 799 F. Supp. 1558 (D. Vt. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        California sole-proprietor of unincorporated business had sufficient contacts with Vermont to support personal jurisdiction where defendant advertised his business in at least one magazine of national circulation, received a small number of inquiries from prospective Vermont customers, and actually obtained one Vermont customer. Blue Compass Corp. v. Polish Masters of America, 777 F. Supp. 4 (D. Vt. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont trial court properly exercised personal jurisdiction over defendant whose oral promise to repay loans was made in Vermont, where substantial portions of the agreement were executed in Vermont, and where defendant retained ownership of Vermont property, sale of which would trigger obligation to repay, long after she received all funds advanced by plaintiff. Cameron v. Burke, 153 Vt. 565, 572 A.2d 1361 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a proceeding relying upon this section for jurisdiction, the action or proceeding against defendant need not arise out of defendant's contracts or activities in Vermont. Braman v. Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital, 631 F.2d 6 (2d Cir. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section's provision for suit against a party served out of State who has, or to whom may be imputed, contacts or activities within the State sufficient to support a personal judgment against him reaches to the outer limits permitted by the due process clause. Braman v. Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital, 631 F.2d 6 (2d Cir. 1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        In suit by resident retired employee against nonresident defendant's employees' retirement plan and its corporate and individual administrators for breach of fiduciary duties, breach of contract and violations of Welfare and Pension Disclosure Act, where plaintiff's pleadings and unopposed supporting affidavits indicated that defendants' contacts and activities at most consisted of three administrative letters mailed to plaintiff in Vermont, such contacts and activities were not sufficient to warrant exercise of personal jurisdiction over defendants by courts of this State, and dismissal of action was required. Anderson v. Abex Corp., 418 F. Supp. 5 (D. Vt.), aff'd, 539 F.2d 703 (2d Cir. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that consequences of defendants' activities have been felt in Vermont, standing alone, is insufficient to sustain personal jurisdiction by Vermont Federal District Court. Anderson v. Abex Corp., 418 F. Supp. 5 (D. Vt.), aff'd, 539 F.2d 703 (2d Cir. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that nonresident corporation sold its product in Vermont did not give rise to cause of action by resident plaintiff suing defendant corporation's employees retirement plan and its nonresident corporate and individual administrators for breach of fiduciary duties, breach of contract and violations of Welfare and Pension Disclosure Act; thus Court lacked personal jurisdiction over defendants under this section. Anderson v. Abex Corp., 418 F. Supp. 5 (D. Vt.), aff'd, 539 F.2d 703 (2d Cir. 1976).

        Since the Vermont long arm statute reflects a clear policy to assert jurisdiction over individuals to the full extent permitted by the due process clause, issue of whether Vermont court may exercise personal jurisdiction over nonresident defendants must be resolved under federal constitutional law. Northern Aircraft, Inc. v. Reed, 154 Vt. 36, 572 A.2d 1382 (1990).

     <p>
      Contributory negligence shall not bar recovery in an action by any plaintiff, or his or her legal representative, to recover damages for negligence resulting in death, personal injury, or property damage, if the negligence was not greater than the causal total negligence of the defendant or defendants, but the damage shall be diminished by general verdict in proportion to the amount of negligence attributed to the plaintiff.
    Where recovery is allowed against more than one defendant, each defendant shall be liable for that proportion of the total dollar amount awarded as damages in the ratio of the amount of his or her causal negligence to the amount of causal negligence attributed to all defendants against whom recovery is allowed.

        Since icy conditions were an obvious and necessary danger inherent in sport of skiing, ski area had no duty to warn plaintiff or take steps to eliminate ice, and summary judgment for ski area in personal injury action was appropriate. Nelson v. Snowridge, Inc., 818 F. Supp. 80 (D. Vt. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme Court would assume that issue of individual versus combined negligence was considered by the legislature and that the state of the law in other jurisdictions was a factor in this consideration. Stannard v. Harris, 135 Vt. 544, 380 A.2d 101 (1977).

         2. Application to strict liability claim.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Comparative liability principles are applicable in strict products liability actions. Apportioning liability more effectively spreads recoveries from manufacturers for selling defective products than the "all or nothing" framework, under which some plaintiffs receive windfalls because they collect damages for injuries caused by their own negligence in addition to damages for injuries caused by the product defect, while some plaintiffs receive nothing because the court or jury has determined that their negligence constitutes misuse, assumption of risk, or an intervening cause, concepts often difficult to distinguish. Webb v. Navistar International Transportation Corp., 166 Vt. 119, 692 A.2d 343 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Juries may consider evidence of a plaintiff's negligence in assessing damages as to strict liability claims as well as to negligence claims. Smith v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 600 F. Supp. 1561 (D. Vt. 1985).

        Contributory negligence does not bar or reduce recovery unless it is affirmatively demonstrated that it proximately caused the accident. Duncan v. Wescott, 142 Vt. 471, 457 A.2d 277 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Contributory negligence does not bar or reduce recovery unless it is the proximate cause, or a part thereof, of the accident. Lee v. Wheeler, 130 Vt. 624, 298 A.2d 851 (1972).

       </h5>
       <p>
        A plaintiff's negligence which does not contribute to the cause of the accident leading to the injury, but does contribute to the injury, may be considered by the jury in assessing damages. Smith v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 600 F. Supp. 1561 (D. Vt. 1985).

        Contributory negligence does not bar recovery in a case brought under a res ipsa loquitur theory. Cyr v. Green Mountain Power Corp., 145 Vt. 231, 485 A.2d 1265 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a plaintiff presents evidence which satisfies the elements of res ipsa loquitur, even in the face of conflicting evidence, the jury must be given the opportunity to infer negligence on the part of the defendant; if the jury finds defendant negligent, then it must compare that negligence with any negligence it finds was committed by plaintiff.

       <p>
        Comparative negligence requires the negligence of the plaintiff to be compared to the negligence of the defendant, and recovery is reduced according to the proportional amount of plaintiff's negligence. Gilman v. Towmotor Corp., 160 Vt. 116, 621 A.2d 1260 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, a plaintiff can recover only if her own negligence contributed to no more than half the cause of the accident, and even then only in proportion to the amount of negligence attributed to defendant. (Per Morse, J., with one justice concurring and one justice concurring in the result.) Favreau v. Miller, 156 Vt. 222, 591 A.2d 68 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        If jury finds culpable negligence on part of both parties, then doctrine of comparative negligence should be applied and any damages assessed on that basis. Tufts v. Wyand, 148 Vt. 528, 536 A.2d 541 (1987).

        Where jury verdict held that plaintiff was 48% negligent in causing collision and resulting injuries, the state 30% negligent and truck driver and his employer 22% negligent, following entry of judgment notwithstanding the verdict in favor of the state, trial court erred in granting judgment notwithstanding the verdict in favor of remaining defendants, based on a comparison of the fault of the remaining parties as determined by the jury; plaintiff was entitled to a new trial on the issue of liability between the remaining parties without consideration of the state's negligence.

       </h5>
       <p>
        A fundamental tenet of the comparative negligence doctrine in Vermont and other states is that defendant, in asserting such a defense, bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff was negligent and that such negligence was a proximate cause of the plaintiff's injuries. Barber v. LaFromboise, 180 Vt. 150, 908 A.2d 436 (August 4, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the issue of comparative negligence is raised and the evidence supports it, the court must instruct that just as plaintiff bore the burden of proof in showing that defendant was negligent, the defendant bears the burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that plaintiff was also negligent, and that such negligence, if any, was a proximate cause of the injuries alleged. Barber v. LaFromboise, 180 Vt. 150, 908 A.2d 436 (August 4, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though the court expressly instructed that it was plaintiff's burden to prove not only that defendant was negligent, but also "to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the negligence was the proximate cause of his injuries," it was prejudicial error for the court not to instruct that - for purposes of establishing plaintiff's comparative negligence - it was defendant's burden to prove that plaintiff's negligence was a proximate cause of the accident, and reversal of the judgment was required. Barber v. LaFromboise, 180 Vt. 150, 908 A.2d 436 (August 4, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Burden of proof in negligence action is on defendant to show not only negligence on part of plaintiff forming part of the proximate cause of the accident, but that it exceeded any negligence on the part of the defendant. Frost v. Tisbert, 135 Vt. 345, 376 A.2d 748 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there is more than one cause concurring to produce an injury, and one such cause is charged against the plaintiff, the burden of proof on that issue is on the defendant. Lee v. Wheeler, 130 Vt. 624, 298 A.2d 851 (1972).

        The trial court properly rejected plaintiff's motion for judgment as a matter of law where the evidence, including defendant's testimony that she observed plaintiff's right-turn signal and plaintiff's acknowledgment that he slowed as he entered the intersection, was sufficient to support the comparative negligence defense.

        Because there was no allegation of plaintiff's negligence after she discovered the injury to her property, and no discrete damages allegedly attributable solely to plaintiff, the trial court should have instructed the jury on comparative negligence rather than on damages mitigation to respond to its claim of plaintiff's negligence.

        In the absence of action by the Legislature to amend Vermont's comparative negligence statute, there was no reason to depart from the interpretation of the statute holding that only those joined in the same action should be considered in apportioning damages. A health center was not a party to plaintiff's action against defendant, and defendant did not allege that plaintiff was comparatively negligent, so the statute did not apply. Levine v. Wyeth, 183 Vt. 76, 944 A.2d 179 (Oct. 27, 2006), cert granted, 128 S. Ct. 1118, 169 L. Ed. 2d 845, 2008 U.S. LEXIS 1100, 76 U.S.L.W. 3391 (U.S. 2008); aff'd, 2009 U.S. LEXIS 1774 (U.S. 2009).

        Allocation of the respective percentages of causal negligence attributable to the plaintiff and defendant is generally a fact question for the jury, and plaintiff's recovery is automatically reduced according to the proportional amount of his or her causal negligence.

    1, eff. Feb. 7, 1978, provided: "Since 1951, the law relating to liability of operators of ski areas in connection with downhill skiing injuries has been perceived to be governed by the doctrine of volenti non fit injuria as set forth in the case of Wright v. Mt. Mansfield Lift, Inc., 96 F. Supp. 786, decided by the United States District Court for Vermont.
    In 1976, in the case of Leopold v. Okemo Mountain, Inc., 420 F. Supp. 781, decided also by the United States District Court for Vermont, the doctrine of assumption of risk was held to be applicable in a downhill skiing injury case, despite the adoption of a comparative negligence statute by the Vermont General Assembly in 1970.
    In 1977, in the case of Sunday v. Stratton Corporation, the Superior Court for Chittenden County of the state of Vermont ruled that the defense of assumption of risk was inappropriate in a comparative negligence case involving a downhill skiing injury.

       "It is a purpose of this act [which added this section and amended section 707(a) of Title 31] to state the policy of this state which governs the liability of operators of ski areas with respect to skiing injury cases, including those resulting from both alpine and nordic skiing, by affirming the principles of law set forth in Wright v. Mt. Mansfield Lift, Inc., and Leopold v. Okemo Mountain, Inc., which established that there are inherent dangers to be accepted by skiers as a matter of law."

        Although defendants' affidavits could be considered in connection with their motions to strike under Vermont's anti-strategic lawsuits against public participation (SLAPP) statute, they could not be considered for purposes of their motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim.

        When parts of an anonymous letter claiming a couple were, inter alia, dishonest, felons, and drug addicts, were read at a meeting of the town selectboard, they qualified as the exercise of free speech giving rise to the right to file a special motion to strike; the couple presented no evidence of what portions were read aloud and they did not establish that the letter was entirely false.

        Where an Internet publication was published in a public forum, and the publication was in furtherance of students' right to free speech and involved speech concerning a public issue, the students and a college have met their threshold burden of proving that their conduct is protected by the anti-SLAPP statute. Haywood v. St. Michael's College, - F. Supp. 2d - (D. Vt. Dec. 14, 2012), aff'd, 2013 U.S. App. LEXIS 21116 (2d Cir. Vt. 2013).

        Conduct meets all three definitions for the anti-SLAPP statute because (1) the plaintiff, as a candidate for President, was in the public eye; (2) the plaintiff had the potential to affect large numbers of people with his candidacy; and (3) the election, as well as each issue area addressed in an Internet article posted by certain college students was a topic of widespread public interest.

        Although the trial court dismissed plaintiff's suit against defendant on other grounds, defendant was still entitled to relief in the form of attorney's fees if successful in dismissing plaintiff's suit under the anti-Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation statute.

       <p>
        Plaintiffs' state law claim for intentional interference with custody did not arise from protected speech but rather, arose from a defendant's furtive departure from the United States immediately before she would have been obligated to surrender the child to plaintiff pursuant to a court order, and the claims asserted against the remaining defendants centered on the support that they allegedly provided to her to carry out this wrongful conduct. The fact that some of the activities that they engaged in might constitute protected speech in some contexts did not salvage the anti-SLAPP claim. Jenkins v. Miller, - F. Supp. 2d - (D. Vt.

        Plaintiff's claims against defendant newspaper were properly struck under the anti-SLAPP (strategic lawsuit against public participation) statute, as the articles published by defendant were exercises of free speech and connected to a public issue because they concerned public safety, law enforcement activity, possible criminal behavior, and the reporting of arrests, and the statements had reasonable factual support, including a state police safety bulletin, social media postings by plaintiff, and a reporter's personal observations.

        Matters connected to law enforcement investigation, public safety, and crime in the community are of public concern for purposes of the anti-SLAPP (strategic lawsuit against public participation) statute. Under the First Amendment, the public and the media have a constitutional right of access to information relating to the activities of law enforcement officers and to information concerning crime in the community.

        "In connection with a public issue" requirement of the anti-Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation (SLAPP) statute must be met in any motion to strike under the statute, regardless of the type of activity. The Court reaches this result as a matter of statutory interpretation in order to implement the intent of the legislature in adopting the anti-SLAPP remedy and keeping that remedy within the bounds of the paradigm on which it was based.

        Because the "in connection with a public issue" requirement of the anti-Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation statute had to be met in any motion to strike under the statute, and the divorce for which defendant business appraiser offered expert testimony was not a matter of public significance, the trial court's failure to rule on its motion to strike was harmless error.

        After an anonymous letter was distributed claiming a couple were, inter alia, dishonest, felons, and drug addicts, the couple's suit raising tort claims was subject to a motion to strike, which failed as to when the letter was sent to residents and handed out at a store because, even if the couple were in the public eye due to participation in zoning and school issues, the letter was insufficiently connected to their role in the issues and did not itself concern a public issue or matter of public interest.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Plain language "shall award" in the anti-SLAPP (strategic lawsuit against public participation) statute indicates that the award of fees is mandatory when a motion to strike is granted. When a statute requires an award of attorney's fees, it is not within the trial court's discretion to determine whether to award such fees; the trial court does, however, have discretion in determining the amount of an award and the court will disturb it only if the court has abused that discretion. Cornelius v. Chronicle, Inc., 209 Vt. 405, 206 A.3d 710 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Anti-SLAPP (strategic lawsuit against public participation) statute does not limit recovery to those fees that are not reimbursed by insurance; therefore, the trial court erred in limiting the award of attorney's fees to the amount of defendant's litigation-insurance deductible. The plain language of the statute does not support this construction in that the statute contains no provision limiting the recovery of attorney's fees to those amounts that were incurred directly by the defendant as opposed to by a third party; moreover, this construction is at odds with the remedial purpose of the statute. Cornelius v. Chronicle, Inc., 209 Vt. 405, 206 A.3d 710 (2019).

         0.5. Constitutionality.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Statute governing certificates of merit in medical malpractice cases did not violate the Common Benefits Clause of the Vermont Constitution, as the situation experienced by plaintiff, whose case would be dismissed because he had failed to file the certificate with his complaint and was now time-barred, and similar litigants was created by their own inadvertence, their decision on when to file the action, and the operation of the applicable statute of limitations. Furthermore, both the certificate statute and the statute of limitations were reasonably related to legitimate governmental purposes. Quinlan v. Five-town Health Alliance, Inc., 207 Vt. 503, 192 A.3d 390 (May 18, 2018).

         1. Application.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Requirement that a certificate of merit in a medical malpractice case be filed simultaneously with the complaint is mandatory and demands strict compliance. When a certificate of merit is entirely omitted from the original complaint, dismissal is necessary to effectuate the statutory purpose of screening out frivolous claims at the outset. Quinlan v. Five-town Health Alliance, Inc., 207 Vt. 503, 192 A.3d 390 (May 18, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is irrelevant whether the defendants suffered prejudice due to a plaintiff's failure to file the certificate of merit in a medical malpractice case. The filing requirement must be strictly complied with, and the failure to do so is the fault of the plaintiff, not the defendants. Quinlan v. Five-town Health Alliance, Inc., 207 Vt. 503, 192 A.3d 390 (May 18, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to file a certificate of merit does not divest the court of its general power to hear a medical malpractice action. Thus, the dismissal of plaintiff's case for failing to file a certificate of merit was not a dismissal for lack of subject matter jurisdiction, and plaintiff's claim was not protected by the statute governing a new action after the failure of the original action. Quinlan v. Five-town Health Alliance, Inc., 207 Vt. 503, 192 A.3d 390 (May 18, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the only injury alleged in the complaint was the decedent's death, which occurred after the operative date of the certificate-of-merit requirement, and the only basis for recovery alleged was the wrongful death statute, the certificate-of-merit statute applied. McClellan v. Haddock, 204 Vt. 252, 166 A.3d 579 (Mar. 3, 2017).

         2. Amendment of complaint to add.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Legislature enacted the certificate-of-merit statute with a clear understanding that the purpose of the simultaneous-filing requirement was to ensure that claims against health care providers had been adequately investigated and determined to have merit by a qualified expert before they were filed. Thus, the trial court properly denied plaintiff's motion to amend her complaint to add a certificate of merit. McClellan v. Haddock, 204 Vt. 252, 166 A.3d 579 (Mar. 3, 2017).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Phrase "where the civil action will be filed" in the certificate-of-merit statute plainly requires that an extension request precede the filing of the complaint, which is consistent with the legislative purpose of requiring that plaintiffs conduct their investigation and obtain the requisite expert opinion before subjecting defendants to the burdens of litigation. Moreover, even if the statute could be construed to authorize an extension request after the filing of a complaint, the trial court here could not have granted a ninety-day extension of a statute of limitation that had already expired when the motion to amend was filed. McClellan v. Haddock, 204 Vt. 252, 166 A.3d 579 (Mar. 3, 2017).

        Dismissal may not necessarily be required where the plaintiff files a timely certificate of merit that nevertheless fails in some particular to meet the requirements of the statute governing certificates of merit in medical malpractice cases, and where allowing an amendment to correct the deficiency - rather than ordering dismissal - would not undermine the legislative purpose.

        Because the Legislature has already made the value judgment that releases entered into within fifteen days may be set aside for that fact alone, as long as the release is rescinded within three years and the consideration returned, to allow plaintiff, who entered into a release on the tenth day following her accident, to rescind on this basis alone or to allow it to weigh heavily in determining unconscionability, would simply be circumventing the terms of the statute.

       <p>
        Common law principle that an agent was a competent witness, either for or against principal, to prove his acts done, or contracts made, as agent, and his authority therefor from his principal, was equally applicable to case of a written contract purporting to be executed by agent in name and behalf of principal, as to a case of a verbal contract.

        Any interest a fellow motorcycle rider had in the outcome of the trial or any relationship he had to the insured was not a disqualification to his status as a witness but went to credibility; any interests he had were merely fodder for cross-examination, and he could therefore testify regarding the events of the accident provided his testimony was otherwise admissible.

        It made no difference as to competency of certain declarations as evidence, whether plaintiff's interest was greater to have will established or defeated, but such consideration might be of importance in regard to weight and credibility of such evidence.

     <p>
      A party shall not be allowed to testify in his or her own favor where the other party to the contract or cause of action in issue and on trial is dead or shown to the court to lack capacity to testify due to a mental condition or psychiatric disability, except as follows:

       To meet the testimony of such deceased or party who lacks capacity to testify due to a mental condition or psychiatric disability upon a question upon which his or her testimony has been taken in writing or by a stenographer in open court to be used in such action and is admitted as evidence therein.

       In addition to the right to testify, as provided in the foregoing exceptions, the living party may be a witness in his or her own favor, so far as to prove in whose handwriting his or her entries are and when they were made and no further, in actions founded on book account and when the matter in issue and on trial is proper matter of book account.

        This section governed question of competency of decedent's statements in federal court civil action, since action was founded in diversity and Vermont substantive law provided rule of decision. Foucher v. First Vermont Bank & Trust Co., 821 F. Supp. 916 (D. Vt. 1993).

        Subsection (5) of this section did not provide exception to general rule disqualifying interested parties from testifying in their own favor when other party is deceased, where statements of decedent in question were not declarations or memoranda, but were merely pieces of conversation decedent had with witness. Foucher v. First Vermont Bank & Trust Co., 821 F. Supp. 916 (D. Vt. 1993).

        Section is exception to general rule of competency, having been originally a proviso in an act having for its object removal and not creation of disqualification, and therefore it should be given a construction inclining towards competency, although a reasonable one in view of the fraudulent practices against which statute was aimed; moreover, it should not be given effect beyond the fair scope of its language. Proulx v. Parrow, 115 Vt. 232, 56 A.2d 623 (1947); Paska v. Saunders, 103 Vt. 204, 153 A. 451 (1930); Lytle v. Bond's Est., 40 Vt. 618 (1868), same case 39 Vt. 388.
       </p>
       <p>
        Competency is now the rule, and incompetency the exception, and provisions disqualifying "other party" to testify in his own favor when one of original parties to contract or cause of action in issue and on trial is dead, or when an executor or administrator is a party, operate as a limitation or exception to the rule. Comstock's Adm'r v. Jacobs, 89 Vt. 133, 94 A. 497 (1915), same case 64 Vt. 277, 78 A. 1017, 86 Vt. 182, 84 A. 568, 89 Vt. 510, 96 A. 4.

       </h5>
       <p>
        This section created an exception to the broad common law rule that disqualified interested parties from testifying in their own favor; thus it was intended to allow otherwise inadmissible evidence rather than to create a rule of disqualification. In re Estate of Farr, 150 Vt. 196, 552 A.2d 387 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Main object of this section is to remove and not to create disqualification, and competency is the rule and incompetency the exception. Lawrence v. Werblow, 122 Vt. 374, 173 A.2d 157 (1961).

       <p>
        In an action for a refund of estate taxes, the government waived reliance on the dead man's statutes when it submitted the deposition of decedent's son, in which he discussed conversations with the decedent, in support of its contention that the father did not intend to bestow upon his son the power to donate property under a power of attorney. Estate of Smith v. United States, 979 F. Supp. 279 (D. Vt. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where no objection was entered in respect to party's testimony in hearing before commissioner of probate court, the prohibitory mandate of this section is deemed waived by the non-objecting party and the other party is to be allowed to testify on such matters at trial. In re Estate of Boisvert, 135 Vt. 69, 370 A.2d 209 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Waiver of this section's disqualification can occur because the disqualified party is allowed to testify in his own favor to the contract or cause of action in issue without objection by the adverse party. In re Estate of Farr, 150 Vt. 196, 552 A.2d 387 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to object in probate court to testimony prohibited by this section will be a waiver of the disqualification for all further proceedings. In re Estate of Farr, 150 Vt. 196, 552 A.2d 387 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where administrator permitted person having claim against estate to testify in relation thereto before commissioners on estate, without objection, he thereby waived provisions making witness incompetent, and such waiver bound estate in hearing on appeal from commissioners' decision. Collins v. Estate of Collins, 104 Vt. 506, 162 A. 361 (1932).

        Since the representative of a deceased party may waive the statutory disqualification of this section, either by calling the witness or by permitting the witness to testify, it was error to exclude evidence in a county court action offered to establish such waiver had taken place in a prior probate proceeding.

        Where, at hearing before probate court on petition for further accounting, petitioners called executrix as witness and examined her generally as to property of decedent, and also called her as witness in county court and examined her as to her administration of estate, they thereby waived her incompetency to testify as to gifts made to her by decedent.

        The Dead Man's statute provides that a party shall not be allowed to testify in his own favor where the other party to the contract or cause of action in issue and on trial is dead; however, there is a broad waiver rule which says that the party using the statute cannot question witnesses who spoke with the deceased and then disallow the adverse party from doing so; party cannot open the door and then close it to suit party's needs.

        Where husband and wife, sellers of partnership, died prior to full payment of purchase price, court, in buyer's action against husband seller's executor, in which buyer claimed husband had orally promised buyer the partnership free and clear should sellers die before full payment, correctly applied this section that when an executor is a party the other party cannot testify in his own favor regarding a contract in issue unless the contract was made with one who is living and competent to testify.

        Trial court erred under the dead man's statute concerning cases where an executor or administrator was a party in excluding testimony offered by homeowners about the decedent's statements to them, because once the co-administrators broached the subject of promises made to the homeowners, the homeowners had the right to meet or explain the nature and extent of those promises.

        Evidence given by landowners as to probable impact of an operating landfill was properly received under this section; however, evidence of transfers of land at assertedly increased prices was of such dubious relevance, particularly since it did not deal with general inflation of property values and assumed a knowledge of the prospective landfill, that it was properly within the discretion of the Superior Court to exclude it in de novo proceeding upon appeal from denial of conditional use permit for operation of landfill.

        Town failed in its contention that the State Housing Authority should have been required to produce an appraisal performed by a third party to rebut the listers' valuation of subsidized housing properties. The authority's director of property and asset management testified as to her belief of the appraised value, offered evidence to support her opinion, and during that testimony, the appraiser had ample opportunity to evaluate the director's knowledge of the properties in issue and to make a judgment about her credibility. These are both determinations within the discretion of the hearing officer. Therefore, no error could be found in the appraiser's decision to allow the director to testify as to the value of the properties. State Housing Authority v. Town of Northfield, 182 Vt. 90, 933 A.2d 700 (July 13, 2007).

        In action to recover possession of house, where defense was that defendant was trying to effect a settlement and was to vacate when settlement was made, evidence by defendant's wife that she heard him say that he was willing to move if he could get a satisfactory settlement was not within provision forbidding a wife to testify against her husband as to any conversation had by him with her or with another person.

        In determining whether the probative value of evidence of a witness' prior convictions is outweighed by its prejudicial effect, the trial court must consider: (1) the nature of the impeaching crime; (2) the length of the defendant's criminal record; (3) the remoteness in time of the convictions; (4) the relative importance of the defendant's testimony; and (5) the need for impeachment in the particular case. State v. Boucher, 144 Vt. 276, 478 A.2d 218 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the case of defendant convicted of breaking and entering in the daytime, where trial court ruled that evidence of his prior convictions involving moral turpitude were admissible, since it was apparent from the transcript below that the court did not give adequate consideration to factors laid down in
        State v. Gardner,
        139 Vt. 456, 433 A.2d 249 (1981), governing admissibility of evidence of prior convictions to impeach the credibility of a witness, except whether each of the convictions involved falsehood, reversal was required and the cause would be remanded. State v. Jarrett, 143 Vt. 191, 465 A.2d 238 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section establishes the outer boundary of admissibility, limiting admission to crimes involving moral turpitude for which conviction occurred within 15 years and removing from trial court all discretion to admit crimes not meeting the prescribed conditions; however, this section does not require that crimes that meet the prescribed conditions always be admitted and does not allow the use of prior convictions to impeach a witness as a matter of right. State v. Gardner, 139 Vt. 456, 433 A.2d 249 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        In exercising its discretion in allowing impeachment of a witness by prior convictions, the trial court may consider a number of factors: the nature of the proceeding; the nature of the crime to be used for impeachment; the length of the defendant's criminal record; the length of time that has passed since the conviction; and the relative importance of the defendant's testimony and the need for impeachment by prior conviction in the case.

        Requirements that a conviction admitted in evidence to impeach credibility of a witness have occurred within fifteen years and involve moral turpitude merely establish the outer limit to admissibility, within which trial court must exercise its discretion, by weighing the probative value of the evidence against its prejudicial effect. State v. Goodrich, 151 Vt. 367, 564 A.2d 1346 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Cross-examination concerning prior convictions in order to discredit a witness is limited to convictions of crimes involving moral turpitude within fifteen years and is subject to the discretion of the trial court. Barrett v. Adirondack Bottled Gas Corp., 145 Vt. 287, 487 A.2d 1074 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        In exercising its discretion concerning cross-examination concerning prior convictions in order to discredit a witness, the court may consider a number of factors in balancing the prejudicial effects of the evidence against its probative value. Barrett v. Adirondack Bottled Gas Corp., 145 Vt. 287, 487 A.2d 1074 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The admission of prior convictions to test the credibility of a witness is subject to the discretion of the trial court, which must determine whether the probative value of such evidence is outweighed by its prejudicial effect. State v. DeJoinville, 145 Vt. 603, 496 A.2d 173 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        At defendant's trial for sexual assault of his eleven-year-old daughter, trial court did not abuse its discretion in permitting defendant to be impeached with a prior conviction for welfare fraud, since the outcome of the case hinged largely on the credibility of two of the witnesses involved. State v. DeJoinville, 145 Vt. 603, 496 A.2d 173 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Cross-examination of a witness concerning prior convictions is subject to the discretion of the trial court. State v. Boucher, 144 Vt. 276, 478 A.2d 218 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court has discretion in deciding whether to permit impeachment of a witness' credibility by use of prior convictions involving moral turpitude. State v. Ritchie, 144 Vt. 121, 473 A.2d 1164 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Impeachment of a witness under this section is not a matter of right, but is subject to the trial court's discretion. State v. Foy, 144 Vt. 109, 475 A.2d 219 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the case of defendant convicted of breaking and entering in the daytime where trial court ruled that evidence of defendant's prior convictions for petty larceny, receiving stolen property and breaking and entering in the daytime were admissible, since the court found that circumstances surrounding defendant's participation in those crimes and the fact that they occurred closely in time to the crime charged indicated a strong disposition for dishonesty, and concluded that their bearing on veracity, when joined with the fact that they constituted the only substantial means of impeachment available to the state, outweighed the risk of prejudice to defendant, the court had a reasonable basis for its ruling and did not abuse its discretion. State v. Foy, 144 Vt. 109, 475 A.2d 219 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the case of defendant convicted of assault and robbery, trial court did not abuse its discretion when it allowed defendant's prior petit larceny record to be placed in evidence for impeachment purposes, since the case had narrowed to the credibility of defendant and a prosecution's witness had been exposed. State v. Boucher, 144 Vt. 276, 478 A.2d 218 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's ruling on admissibility of prior convictions to impeach the credibility of a witness is a discretionary one, to be made in light of all the relevant circumstances, no one of which is in itself governing. State v. Jarrett, 143 Vt. 191, 465 A.2d 238 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Cross-examination of a witness concerning prior convictions is subject to the discretion of the trial court; prior decision in
        State v. Manning,
        136 Vt. 436, 392 A.2d 409 (1978), interpreting this section, and holding that a witness may be impeached by cross-examination concerning any prior convictions for crimes involving moral turpitude within 15 years and that trial court has no discretion to exclude this form of impeachment, was incorrect.

       <p>
        Larceny is a crime of moral turpitude because it is inherently base, and if committed within fifteen years, it is admissible for impeachment purposes, subject to the trial court's discretion. State v. Boucher, 144 Vt. 276, 478 A.2d 218 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant was charged with breaking and entering in the daytime, trial court did not abuse its discretion in ruling that his prior conviction for receiving stolen property involved moral turpitude and, therefore, was admissible for impeachment purposes, since the element of wrongful intent to take and keep the property of another was sufficient to make the crime inherently base. State v. Foy, 144 Vt. 109, 475 A.2d 219 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Conviction of income tax evasion under the federal statutes may, or may not, be a crime involving moral turpitude. Pond v. Carter, 126 Vt. 299, 229 A.2d 248 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Only where the method of tax evasion charged in the indictment necessarily involves fraud, is a conviction on a plea of guilty or nolo contendere conclusive as to fraud or moral turpitude. Pond v. Carter, 126 Vt. 299, 229 A.2d 248 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court has no discretionary power to receive evidence of criminal conviction for offense other than that involving moral turpitude, to attack credibility of witness, but court must rule whether as matter of law the crime involves moral turpitude. Pond v. Carter, 126 Vt. 299, 229 A.2d 248 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Crime involving moral turpitude must be based on conduct which is not only socially undesirable but which is, by its nature, base or depraved. State v. Fournier, 123 Vt. 439, 193 A.2d 924 (1963); Pond v. Carter, 126 Vt. 299, 229 A.2d 248 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Offense of drunken driving does not involve moral turpitude. State v. Fournier, 123 Vt. 439, 193 A.2d 924 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section as amended removed discretionary power of trial court to receive evidence of a criminal conviction for an offense other than that involving moral turpitude on the subject of the credibility of a witness. State v. Russ, 122 Vt. 236, 167 A.2d 528 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that witness had several times been convicted on plea of guilty of crimes of stealing and obtaining money under false pretenses involved moral turpitude and affected witness's credibility and was properly admitted in evidence under objection of immateriality.

       </p>

        During impeachment by prior conviction the number of counts may be shown, since if the fact of conviction on one count has probative value on credibility, so conviction on more than one count has similar value without unfairness. State v. Boucher, 144 Vt. 276, 478 A.2d 218 (1984).

       <p>
        Where witness was asked by State's Attorney whether she had been convicted of burglary and gave no direct answer, it was improper for state's attorney to later ask if witness had served time in women's reformatory, and it was error to receive answer that she had, but not for burglary; but the error was cured by substantial compliance with this section consisting of the introduction, later in the trial, or copies of the record of conviction which were certified by the Commissioner of Public Safety and the Director of Public Records. State v. Miner, 128 Vt. 55, 258 A.2d 815 (1969).

       <p>
        Proper and timely objections to questions regarding parole of the respondent as a result of conviction for breaking and entering, and his possible violations of parole, an admission of such questions would have been in error; such questions could not have been asked to impeach the character of the respondent because only he could have introduced that issue; nor was such evidence admissible under this section as affecting the credibility of a witness. State v. Ladabouche, 127 Vt. 171, 243 A.2d 769 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        To attack credibility of witness under this section, it is not necessary to produce the record of conviction but conviction may be shown by the party himself on cross-examination, or through independent evidence. Pond v. Carter, 126 Vt. 299, 229 A.2d 248 (1967).
       </p>

        The test for determining whether prosecutor used prior convictions as evidence of guilt of the crime charged is whether the reference to the defendant's prior convictions during his cross-examination can be intended only to suggest to the jury that defendant is guilty of the crime charged because of his previous conviction or convictions.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where testimony admitted over objection as to defendant's prior arrests for driving while intoxicated showed only a general tendency to commit the offense of operating vehicle under influence of intoxicating liquor and did not involve moral turpitude, such testimony was not admissible under this section to affect credibility in later proceeding, even had it been offered for that purpose and proved by records of conviction.

       <p>
        Child who opposed state's petition to have him declared in need of supervision placed his mental health in issue by such opposition and could not thereafter assert doctor-patient privilege to exclude testimony of his psychologist concerning him and his mother; the impact of the home environment on the juvenile lies at the heart of any child in need of supervision proceeding.

       <p>
        An act by a party to a civil proceeding, placing his or her health at issue, has the effect of waiving the physician-patient privilege of this section. In re M.M., 153 Vt. 102, 569 A.2d 463 (1989), cert. denied, 494 U.S. 1059, 110 S. Ct. 1532, 108 L. Ed. 2d 771 (1990), superseded by statute as stated in In re B.W. (1994) 162 Vt. 287, 648 A.2d 652.

       <p>
        The privilege provided in subsection (a) of this section is not sacrosanct and can properly be waived in the interest of public policy under appropriate circumstances. Peck v. Counseling Service of Addison County, Inc., 146 Vt. 61, 499 A.2d 422 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        A mental patient's threat of serious harm to an identified victim is an appropriate circumstance under which the physician-patient privilege may be waived; however, the therapist's obligation to the patient requires that he not disclose a confidence unless such disclosure is necessary to avert danger to others, and even then that he do so discreetly, and in a fashion that would preserve the privacy of his patient to the fullest extent compatible with the prevention of the threatened danger. Peck v. Counseling Service of Addison County, Inc., 146 Vt. 61, 499 A.2d 422 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Once the patient has waived the privilege afforded him under this section by the commencement of an action, such waiver applies to the discovery of matters causally or historically related to the patient-plaintiff's health put in issue by the injuries and damages claimed in the action. Castle v. Sherburne Corp., 141 Vt. 157, 446 A.2d 350 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Waiving of privilege under this section relating to information acquired by a licensed practical nurse while attending a patient in a professional capacity is within the province of the patient and not the nurse. State v. Raymond, 139 Vt. 464, 431 A.2d 453 (1981).
       </p>

        The bringing of an action for damages arising from injuries to the person constitutes a waiver, with respect to those injuries, of the privilege granted by doctor-patient privilege statute, and plaintiff could be ordered to answer interrogatories relating to the otherwise privileged information.

        Observations of a patient's mental or physical condition by a licensed practical nurse is just as much information acquired while attending the patient as statements, admissions or other utterances made by the patient to the nurse, and if the observation is one which is necessary to enable the nurse to act in a professional capacity, then it is privileged information.

        Where record shows that court merely found that plaintiff "had a right to cross-examine" witness called by him, it will be presumed that the court found that witness was hostile, the contrary not appearing. Jewell v. Hoosac Tunnel & W.R.R., 85 Vt. 64, 81 A. 238 (1911).
       </p>
       <p>
        When court allows a party to impeach his own witness because witness's "testimony is adverse," that is tantamount to a finding by court that witness himself is adverse within this section. Hurlburt v. Hurlburt's Est., 63 Vt. 667, 22 A. 850 (1890).

     <p>
      An expert witness may be asked to state his or her opinion based on the witness' personal observation, or on evidence introduced at the trial and seen or heard by the witness, or on his or her technical knowledge of the subject, without first specifying hypothetically in the question the data on which this opinion is based.
    On direct or cross-examination, such expert witness may be required to specify the data on which his or her opinion is based.

         1. Generally.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Under provision of this section that an expert witness may be asked to state his opinion based on his personal observation or on evidence seen or heard at the trial without first specifying the data upon which his opinion is based, supplying the specific data may be left to later direct or cross-examination, the form of the question and sufficiency of the information are left to the discretion of the trial judge, and a shortage in the basic facts is properly challenged by a subsequent motion to strike. Bean v. Sears, Roebuck & Co., 129 Vt. 278, 276 A.2d 613 (1971).

         2. Purpose.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Section did not enlarge scope of expert testimony or class of subjects upon which opinion evidence is receivable. Tinney v. Crosby, 112 Vt. 95, 22 A.2d 145 (1941).

         3. Basis of expert opinion.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        A witness qualified as an expert may state an opinion without specifying the date on which it is based, and the underlying data may subsequently be developed through direct, cross, or redirect examination. Fox v. McLain, 142 Vt. 11, 451 A.2d 1122 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Opinion of an expert may properly result from a combination of what he learns from personal observation and from information gained at trial. Farr v. State Highway Board, 122 Vt. 156, 166 A.2d 187 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        Opinion of expert must be based on facts disclosed by evidence in case and not in whole or in part on speculation of witness as to what might have been evidence. Bliss v. Moore, 112 Vt. 185, 22 A.2d 315 (1941).

         4. Hypothetical questions.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Answer to a hypothetical question may be admitted, in court's discretion, although question may not embrace all facts necessary to arrive at a sound conclusion. Marsigli's Estate v. Granite City Auto Sales, Inc., 124 Vt. 95, 197 A.2d 799 (1963); Verchereau v. Jameson, 122 Vt. 189, 167 A.2d 521 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        Hypothetical question, which does not include all facts relating to situation at issue, is not thereby rendered inadmissible, since omissions in some aspects of detail may affect only weight of opinion given. Verchereau v. Jameson, 122 Vt. 189, 167 A.2d 521 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        Purpose of section was to exempt inquirer from requirement of using hypothetical question in examination but to accord him option of using it, both in discretion of court, and to permit opposing party to call for a hypothetical specification of data used as basis of opinion. Tinney v. Crosby, 112 Vt. 95, 22 A.2d 145 (1941).

       <p>
        A properly qualified expert may give his opinion as to the rate of speed an automobile is traveling in given circumstances when an adequate factual basis exists for such opinion. Cross v. Estate of Patch, 123 Vt. 11, 178 A.2d 393 (1961).

         6. Competency.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The question of competency of an expert witness is a preliminary one for the trial court to determine in its sound discretion, and the court's action is not reversible on appeal unless it appears from the evidence to be erroneous or founded upon an error of law. Hall v. Miller, 143 Vt. 135, 465 A.2d 222 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Opinion of witness qualified in field of accident reconstruction as to path taken by auto of defendant sued for damages arising from two-car collision, based partly on his conversations with persons who had not testified and his consulting of statements of certain witnesses, was properly before the jury. Lambert v. Fuller, 131 Vt. 181, 303 A.2d 471 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Competency of a witness as an expert is a question for the trial court, and it was therefore error to instruct the jury that ". . . you must decide . . . whether he . . . has qualified in your opinion as an expert." Campbell v. Beede, 124 Vt. 434, 207 A.2d 236 (1965).

        The question of competency of an expert witness is a preliminary one for the trial court to determine in its sound discretion, and the court's action is not revisable on appeal unless it appears from the evidence to be erroneous or founded upon an error of law.

        In architect's suit to recover for preparation of plans and specifications under contract expert testimony by a licensed, practicing architect as to the measure of a reasonable fee where plans are prepared, but the building is not carried out was properly admitted on issue of damages.

       Whenever a witness refuses, on the basis of his or her privilege against self-incrimination, to testify or provide other information in a proceeding before or ancillary to a court or grand jury of the State of Vermont, and the presiding judge communicates to the witness an order issued under subsection (b) of this section, the witness may not refuse to comply with the order on the basis of his or her privilege against self-incrimination; but no testimony or other information compelled under the order, or any information directly or indirectly derived from such testimony or other information, may be used for any purpose, including impeachment and cross-examination, against the witness in any criminal case, except a prosecution for perjury, giving a false statement, or otherwise failing to comply with the order.
    The State shall have the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that any proffered evidence was derived from sources totally independent of the compelled testimony.

       <p>
        The provision of use and derivative use immunity to a reluctant witness pursuant to 12 V.S.A.
        ยง
        1664(a) is consistent with the self-incrimination privilege established by Vt. Const. ch. I, art. 10, as long as "derivative use" is defined sufficiently broadly to provide equivalent protection to that provided by the privilege and certain procedural protections, such as requiring the State to show nonuse of the compelled evidence, are afforded. State v. Ely, 167 Vt. 323, 708 A.2d 1332 (1997).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In Vermont, the power to grant witness immunity lies exclusively within the discretion of the prosecutor, and the State is under no constitutional obligation to confer such immunity. State v. Haner, 182 Vt. 7, 928 A.2d 518 (June 1, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the limited circumstances where an exception to prosecutors' exclusive authority to grant use immunity has been recognized, defendant has been faced with the difficult choice of testifying and risking self-incrimination or remaining silent and forfeiting other important rights. This rule has not been extended, however, to defense witnesses who invoke the privilege against self-incrimination, and the court has likewise been cautious to limit its applicability, even to defendants, to situations where public policy demands the availability of immunity. State v. Haner, 182 Vt. 7, 928 A.2d 518 (June 1, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Immunity can attach to statements made at different times even if they relate to the same incident; argument was rejected that since language under subsection (a) of this section refers to "an" agreement immunity cannot be given twice. State v. Briggs, 152 Vt. 531, 568 A.2d 779 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, the power to grant witness immunity, or to request a court order requiring a witness to testify subject to such immunity, vests exclusively within the discretion of the Attorney General and the State's attorneys, not in the courts. State v. Hamlin, 146 Vt. 97, 499 A.2d 45 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (b) applies only to one testifying in prosecution or investigation within terms of subsec. (a). State v. Howard, 108 Vt. 137, 183 A. 497 (1935).

         3. Scope of immunity.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Contrary to defendant's assertion that the mere proffer of his brother's facially exculpatory testimony triggered the court's inherent power to grant defense witness immunity, defendant was required to make a convincing showing that the testimony which would be forthcoming was both clearly exculpatory and essential to his case before the court might compel immunity. State v. Haner, 182 Vt. 7, 928 A.2d 518 (June 1, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        In case where defendant sought the grant of use immunity to his brother who had previously made exculpatory statements, in light of the increased motive of close relatives to fabricate exculpatory evidence, the inconsistencies between defendant's confession and witnesses' testimony, and the general circumstances surrounding the confession, defendant failed to make a "convincing showing" that the proffered testimony was "clearly exculpatory." Because defendant failed to meet the first element of the test for judicial use immunity that he advanced, the trial court did not err as a matter of law when it declined to grant immunity to defendant's brother. State v. Haner, 182 Vt. 7, 928 A.2d 518 (June 1, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where individuals, who are compelled to testify in court or grand jury proceedings, wish to invoke their right against self-incrimination, their testimony, and any evidence derived directly or indirectly from it, cannot be used in subsequent criminal proceedings against them; this immunity applies only to those called to testify in a proceeding before or ancillary to a court or grand jury, not to administrative proceedings. State v. Welch, 160 Vt. 70, 624 A.2d 1105 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Immunity can be granted only insofar as a privilege against self-incrimination exists; statement by witness which obviously did not subject her to any criminal liability was not a proper subject of a grant of immunity. State v. Briggs, 152 Vt. 531, 568 A.2d 779 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not support a grant of immunity exceeding what is necessary to supplant the privilege against self-incrimination. State v. Couture, 146 Vt. 268, 502 A.2d 846 (1985).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Successive offers of immunity and ultimate grant of immunity to witness were within the parameters of the State's attorney's discretion under this section; contention was rejected that repeated offers of immunity could only produce perjured testimony. State v. Briggs, 152 Vt. 531, 568 A.2d 779 (1989).

        So far as rules relating to admission of ledger entries as evidence, especially those made in book of a person not a party to action being tried, are set forth in section, they govern to the exclusion of common law on that subject. Crowley v. Goodrich, 114 Vt. 304, 44 A.2d 128 (1945).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Questions concerning the admissibility of business records such as a bill for services allegedly performed are governed by this section, the purpose of which is to ease the requirement that the person actually keeping the record testify as to its accuracy. Dufresne-Henry Eng. Corp. v. Gilcris Ent., Inc., 136 Vt. 274, 388 A.2d 416 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Uniform Business Records as Evidence Act provides relief from the stringent common law rules of evidence, which required testimony from the actual custodian of the records or the person who made the original entry as a sufficient foundation for the introduction of a business record into evidence. Colonial Plumbing Corp. v. Solar Heating, Inc., 133 Vt. 82, 329 A.2d 638 (1974).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Since the purpose of Uniform Business Records as Evidence Act is to provide relief from rigid common law rules on admissibility of business records, records offered in evidence ought to be received unless the trial court entertains serious doubt as to their dependability. Westinghouse Electric v. B. L. Allen, Inc., 138 Vt. 84, 413 A.2d 122 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        In absence of some proof throwing suspicion upon genuineness of a business record, it is sufficient, to establish its admissibility, if it is verified by a witness who can testify that records of that type have been regularly prepared under a routine warranting reliability and that the particular record in question is of that class; where reliability is questioned it is within court's discretion to require a greater showing on the part of the proponent of the record. State v. Burclaff, 138 Vt. 461, 418 A.2d 38 (1980).

        In action for materials supplied, salesman, though not the custodian of plaintiff's ledger card and invoices showing defendant's account, could identify them and the mode of their preparation as a foundation for their admission, under provision of this section providing that admissibility was conditioned on trial court's opinion that "the sources of information, method and time of preparation were such as to justify its admission". Colonial Plumbing Corp. v. Solar Heating, Inc., 133 Vt. 82, 329 A.2d 638 (1974).

State v. Berard, 132 Vt. 138, 315 A.2d 501, cert. denied, 417 U.S. 950, 94 S. Ct. 3078, 41 L. Ed. 2d 671 (1974).

        The qualifications of the qualified witness who must testify to identity and mode of preparation of a business record and whether it was made in regular course of business at or near time of what it records, and the sufficiency of the testimony of the witness, are for the trial court to determine in the exercise of its discretion and the light of the sources of information and the method and time of preparation, when admission of a business record in evidence is sought.

       No court of this State shall issue an order requiring the disclosure of individually-identifiable HIV-related testing or counseling information unless the court finds that the person seeking the information has demonstrated a compelling need for it that cannot be accommodated by other means.
    In assessing compelling need, the court shall weigh the need for disclosure against the privacy interest of the test subject and the public interest which may be disserved by disclosure which deters future testing or which may lead to discrimination.

       Pleadings pertaining to disclosure of HIV-related testing and counseling information shall substitute a pseudonym for the true name of the subject of the test.
    The subject's true name shall be communicated confidentially to the court and those parties who have a compelling need to know the subject's true name.
    All documents filed with the court which identify the subject's true name shall not be disclosed to any person other than those parties who have a compelling need to know the subject's true name and the subject of the test.
    All such documents shall be sealed upon the conclusion of proceedings under this section.

      <li id="t12p04c63s1705ol1c">
       Before granting any such order, the court shall provide the individual whose test information is in question with notice and a reasonable opportunity to participate in the proceedings if he or she is not already a party.

       Court proceedings as to disclosure of counseling and testing information shall be conducted in camera unless the subject of the test agrees to a hearing in open court or unless the court determines that a public hearing is necessary to the public interest and the proper administration of justice.

       Upon issuance of an order to disclose test results, the court shall impose appropriate safeguards against unauthorized disclosure, which shall specify the persons who may have access to the information, the purposes for which the information shall be used, and appropriate prohibitions on future disclosure.

        Where the issue in a medical malpractice case was whether plaintiffs established a genuine issue of material fact such that the case could not be resolved on summary judgment, the usual V.R.C.P. 56 standard applied. Provost v. Fletcher Allen Health Care, Inc., 179 Vt. 545, 890 A.2d 97 (mem.) (October 6, 2005).

        Where an expert's affidavit stated that "among other things, [defendant] failed to exercise the appropriate degree of care during that injection by inserting the needle to the point it made contact with the bone of the arm and injured the radial nerve," it could reasonably be inferred that, in plaintiffs' view, the requisite standard of care was to not insert the needle so deeply that it contacts the bone and injures the radial nerve. Although the better practice is for the affiant to expressly articulate the standard of care, the affidavit satisfied plaintiffs' burden under 12 V.S.A.

        The loss-of-chance theory of recovery is fundamentally at odds with the settled common-law and statutory standard for establishing a causal link between plaintiff's injury and defendant's tortious conduct. Smith v. Parrott, 175 Vt. 375, 833 A.2d 843 (2003).

       <p>
        The standard-of-care and causation elements of professional negligence claims ordinarily must be proved by expert testimony, and this is no less true of claims relating to the negligent treatment or assessment of patients at risk of committing suicide. Wilkins v. Lamoille County Mental Health Services, Inc., 179 Vt. 107, 889 A.2d 245 (October 21, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where expert testimony suggested that, had physician either performed a diagnostic test or made a referral to a urologist, there was a significant chance that patient's cancer would have been organ-confined and, therefore, could have been cured by radiation or radical prostatectomy, physician's negligence deprived patient of a significant chance for recovery and under the loss of a chance doctrine, physician's failure to diagnose was a proximate cause of patient's harm. Short v. United States, 908 F. Supp. 227 (D. Vt. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court in a medical malpractice action need not charge the jury that the plaintiff must introduce expert testimony to prove each element of medical malpractice. Deyo v. Kinley, 152 Vt. 196, 565 A.2d 1286 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordinarily, elements of malpractice set out in this section must be proved by expert testimony. Begin v. Richmond, 150 Vt. 517, 555 A.2d 363 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient for jury under this section where plaintiffs' expert testified that the standard of care for urologist was to inform patient that a vasectomy can recanalize at any time, that defendant's actions fell below standard of care, and that pregnancy was caused by recanalization. Begin v. Richmond, 150 Vt. 517, 555 A.2d 363 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Normally the burden of proof imposed by this section will be satisfied only by expert testimony. Larson v. Candlish, 144 Vt. 499, 480 A.2d 417 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        An exception to the rule requiring expert testimony in medical malpractice cases exists where the alleged violation of the standard of care is so apparent that it may be understood by a lay trier of fact without the aid of an expert. Larson v. Candlish, 144 Vt. 499, 480 A.2d 417 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff in professional malpractice action, who alleged that dentist violated applicable standards of care by administering novocaine, rather than nitrous oxide gas, during root canal procedure, but offered no evidence except for her own unsubstantiated opinion that the dentist had failed properly to perform the procedure, failed to carry her burden of proof, since alleged deviation from accepted practices was not so obvious as to preclude the requirement of expert testimony. Larson v. Candlish, 144 Vt. 499, 480 A.2d 417 (1984).

         3. Evidence.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In medical malpractice, as in tort law generally, plaintiff must prove that as a result of defendant's conduct the injuries "would not otherwise have been incurred," and therefore, an act or omission of defendant cannot be considered a cause of plaintiff's injury if the injury would probably have occurred without it. Wilkins v. Lamoille County Mental Health Services, Inc., 179 Vt. 107, 889 A.2d 245 (October 21, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff must prove that as a result of the defendant's conduct the injuries "would not otherwise have been incurred," an act or omission of defendant cannot be considered a cause of the plaintiff's injury if the injury would probably have occurred without it; accordingly, where this was the state of the evidence, summary judgment in favor of defendant was sound under the law. Smith v. Parrott, 175 Vt. 375, 833 A.2d 843 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Testimony of plaintiff's expert witness that plaintiff's injury would not have happened but for the lack of requisite care, that the extent of plaintiff's prior injury was not fully appreciated by defendant before surgery, that the surgery was performed without sufficient information, and as a result plaintiff suffered an injury that should have been avoided, was sufficient to allow a jury to find proximate cause. Jones v. Block, 171 Vt. 569, 762 A.2d 846 (mem.) (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although it is true that breach of standard of care cannot be based solely on a bad medical result, there was sufficient other evidence to permit a reasonable jury, drawing reasonable inferences from the evidence introduced, to conclude that defendant breached standard of care. Lockwood v. Lord, 163 Vt. 210, 657 A.2d 555 (1994).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court's improper instructions on standard of care were not cured by context in which they appeared because, although beginning and end of standard-of-care instruction correctly stated law, "mere error of judgment" language may even have misled jury to think that selection of appropriate course of treatment absolves doctor from liability regardless of administration of that treatment. Rooney v. Medical Center Hospital of Vermont, Inc., 162 Vt. 513, 649 A.2d 756 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's instruction on proper standard of care improperly permitted jury to conclude that physician who lacked requisite skill or knowledge was not liable as long as she used her best judgment and reasonable care in exercise of whatever skill or knowledge she did possess, however limited. Rooney v. Medical Center Hospital of Vermont, Inc., 162 Vt. 513, 649 A.2d 756 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's error in suggesting subjective standard of care in medical malpractice case was compounded by reiteration of best judgment language in rest of instruction, which referred to level of knowledge, skill and care previously described. Rooney v. Medical Center Hospital of Vermont, Inc., 162 Vt. 513, 649 A.2d 756 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's standard of care instruction did not meet court's often stated standard of review by breathing true spirit and doctrine of law. Rooney v. Medical Center Hospital of Vermont, Inc., 162 Vt. 513, 649 A.2d 756 (1994).

        Whether or not a doctor has ceased treating a patient is irrelevant to whether he or she may be held liable for injuries resulting from his or her failure to exercise the proper degree of care while treating the patient. It is the doctor's responsibility for the services provided that is significant here, and not simply the duration of the doctor-patient relationship itself. White v.

        A prerequisite to liability under this section is a finding that a reasonable patient would not have given consent to the medical procedure had he fully known of the risks; however, it does not impose on a physician a general duty to inform a patient of each and every possible risk or treatment.

        In medical malpractice action, the trial court erred in refusing to fully charge this section where the basis of the action was the claim that the plaintiff had not knowingly and intelligently consented to treatment with a particular drug because plaintiff had not been made aware of the reasonably foreseeable risks, in particular a potential adverse reaction when combined with alcohol, where the defendant testified that, although he did not recall actually warning plaintiff of this risk, it nevertheless was his "custom" to give such an oral warning, and where an expert testified that, even if the physician had given his customary warning, it would not have provided plaintiff with sufficient information concerning the dangers to permit plaintiff to make a knowledgeable evaluation to undergo the treatment.

        Doctrine of informed consent made extent of what patient needed to know and ought to be told in order to intelligently consent to proposed treatment a matter resolvable by jury without expert medical testimony, and was intended to add to theories of liability and eliminate proof barriers, not to restrict liability.

        Since a reasonable patient presented with physician's preliminary diagnosis of benign prostatic hyperplasia would have chosen watchful waiting and since at the time practitioners varied in their practice of using and informing patients of the availability of prostate specific antigen tests, physician was not liable under the Vermont informed consent statute.

        Plaintiffs' failure to show that a reasonable patient would not have consented to the vasectomy if fully informed of risks precluded recovery under this section. Begin v. Richmond, 150 Vt. 517, 555 A.2d 363 (1988).

        Generally, battery occurs only when a physician performs an operation for which there was no consent. If the patient does provide consent for the procedure employed, but receives inadequate disclosures of the alternatives and foreseeable risks and benefits of the alternatives, liability must be based on lack of informed consent and a claim of medical malpractice in failing to provide the necessary disclosures. Christman v. Davis, 179 Vt. 99, 889 A.2d 746 (October 21, 2005).

       "(2) 'Department' means the department of banking, insurance, securities, and health care administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(b) The Sorry Works! pilot program is established under the oversight of the commissioner. Any hospital that voluntarily chooses to participate shall be eligible for the program beginning on January 1, 2007. Hospitals may participate only with the approval of the hospital administration and the hospital's medical staff.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(c)(1) Under the program, participating hospitals and physicians shall promptly acknowledge and apologize for mistakes in patient care that result in harm and promptly offer fair settlements. If a settlement is accepted, further litigation with respect to the mistake shall be prohibited.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(2) Participating hospitals shall provide to the patient written notification of the patient's right to legal counsel. The notification shall include an affirmative declaration that no action was taken to dissuade a patient from using counsel for the negotiations.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(3) A communication between parties engaged in negotiation pursuant to this program is privileged and is not subject to discovery or admissible in evidence in any civil or administrative proceeding.

       "(e) The commissioner shall establish criteria for the program, including the criteria under which hospitals shall be selected to participate. A program participant may withdraw from the program by notifying the commissioner. Any mistakes in patient care that result in harm that occurred prior to the program participant notifying the commissioner shall continue to be subject to this section and the terms of the program.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(f) In consultation with hospitals, providers, and other interested parties, the department shall adopt rules to implement the pilot program no later than October 1, 2006.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(g) The department shall initiate a dialogue with insurers and encourage them to participate in the Sorry Works! pilot program with any hospital that is willing to commit to the program.

       <p>
        Statute permitting peremptory challenge of jurors by State in criminal cases is constitutional. State v. Ward, 61 Vt. 153, 17 A. 483 (1888), same case (1887) 60 Vt. 142, 14 A. 187.

        A liberal, though not unlimited, opportunity to examine jurors drawn, to test and consider their respective qualifications, and to assert and exercise right of challenge, is essential to full enjoyment of constitutional right to jury trial. State v. Mercier, 98 Vt. 368, 127 A. 715 (1925).

        Section did not require that right of challenge must be exercised at very time a juror's name is drawn. State v. Mercier, 98 Vt. 368, 127 A. 715 (1925).
       </p>
       <p>
        Respondent's right to challenge peremptorily continues until the juror is sworn - even if he had accepted juror. State v. Spaulding, 60 Vt. 228, 14 A. 769 (1887).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Under prior law which allowed State same number of peremptory challenges as were allowed respondents, where there were several respondents, State was allowed as many as respondents together. State v. Noakes, 70 Vt. 247, 40 A. 249 (1897); State v. Marsh, 70 Vt. 288, 40 A. 836 (1898).
       </p>
       <p>
        Every respondent, whether indicted and tried alone or with others, was entitled to statutory number of peremptory challenges; and, if indicted with others, he did not waive that right by consenting to be tried with them. State v. Stoughton, 51 Vt. 362 (1879); State v. Fournier, 68 Vt. 262, 35 A. 178 (1896).

       <p>
        Plaintiff in negligence action would not be heard to complain of error in the overruling of his challenges for cause since it did not force him to exhaust his peremptory challenges. Lattrell v. Swain & Swain, 127 Vt. 33, 239 A.2d 195 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff did exercise his right of peremptory challenge to remove three jurors whom he challenged for cause but he did not exhaust his peremptory challenges, plaintiff waived alleged error committed by trial court in previously ruling adversely on the challenge of such jurors for cause. Lattrell v. Swain & Swain, 127 Vt. 33, 239 A.2d 195 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Respondent in a criminal trial had no ground of complaint, when he challenged a juror for cause and was refused, and then challenged peremptorily, if he had challenges left when panel was filled. State v. Gaffney, 56 Vt. 451 (1884).

         8. Bias as ground for disqualification.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        If the examination of a juror clearly exposes a state of mind evincing a fixed opinion, bias, or prejudice, such juror is properly subject to challenge for cause. Lattrell v. Swain & Swain, 127 Vt. 33, 239 A.2d 195 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        An expressed opinion, founded on reports in newspapers of evidence given at a preliminary examination of respondent, did not disqualify juror, when his opinion was dependent upon the correctness of the reports; to disqualify there must be an abiding bias in the mind, based upon the substantial facts in the case, in the existence of which the juror believes. State v. Meyer, 58 Vt. 457, 3 A. 195 (1886), overruled on other grounds, (1892) 65 Vt. 1, 25 A. 964, 52 Harv. L. Rev. 593.
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that challenged juror admitted he had formed opinion but was not aware of any prejudice against respondent and had no recollection of having expressed an opinion in the premises was not legal cause for challenge. State v. Tatro, 50 Vt. 483 (1878).
       </p>
       <p>
        That a juror had formed but not expressed an opinion as to guilt or innocence of respondent, did not disqualify him in criminal case. State v. Phair, 48 Vt. 366 (1875).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a juror said, upon inquiry by counsel, as he was called, that he had expressed an opinion as to the guilt of the respondent, on reading a newspaper account of the examination before the magistrate, a few weeks before, but that he had no opinion, and had formed none, and could try case impartially on evidence, he was disqualified.

       <p>
        Declaration of a juror that he had conscientious scruples against rendering a verdict of guilty where punishment was death, sincerely made, was sufficient to excuse him from serving as juror in such case. State v. Ward, 39 Vt. 225 (1867); State v. Shaw, 73 Vt. 149, 50 A. 863 (1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where in murder trial one of jurors declared he had conscientious scruples against rendering verdict of guilty where punishment was death, and stated he believed law inflicting punishment of death was wrong, but if compelled to sit as juror, if he was fully satisfied respondent was guilty, he would render verdict of guilty, but felt he was not proper person to sit as juryman in such case, and that it would require more evidence to induce him to render a verdict of guilty in a case where punishment was death than where it was imprisonment, question whether he should be excused or not was one of fact for decision of the county court, and not revisable in Supreme Court.

       </p>
       <p>
        The competency of a juror will be presumed until the contrary is shown, and the burden is upon the challenging party to establish the disqualification of the juror. Lattrell v. Swain & Swain, 127 Vt. 33, 239 A.2d 195 (1967).

         3. Separation of jury.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for a misdemeanor mere separation of one of the jurors from his fellow jurymen does not require a mistrial as a matter of law. State v. Bogie, 125 Vt. 414, 217 A.2d 51 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        The rules governing the separation of juries are based upon a difference of degree. State v. Brisson, 124 Vt. 211, 201 A.2d 881 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        In misdemeanor cases, just as civil cases, the trial court's discretion in the propriety of separation of juries, is operative. State v. Brisson, 124 Vt. 211, 201 A.2d 881 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the discretionary power of trial courts to allow juries to separate is questioned, each case involving this issue will be decided on its own facts. State v. Brisson, 124 Vt. 211, 201 A.2d 881 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        In exercising its discretion as to the propriety of separation of the jury, it is for the trial court to weigh concern for the prompt, orderly administration of criminal law against the possibility of jury prejudice in a given case. State v. Brisson, 124 Vt. 211, 201 A.2d 881 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        A ten-day separation of the jury between impanelling and the presentation of evidence is not an abuse of discretion and prejudicial to the respondent as a matter of law. State v. Brisson, 124 Vt. 211, 201 A.2d 881 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where respondent had insisted that the jury be allowed to separate while court was not in session, he could not thereafter object as a matter of law, without proof of actual prejudice, that the jurors had disobeyed the court's direction that while separated they avoid all matters that might touch upon their ability to render a verdict impartially. State v. Woodmansee, 124 Vt. 387, 205 A.2d 407 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Complete dispersion of jury in case of felony, defendant not having consented thereto, was ground for setting aside verdict. State v. Anderson, 119 Vt. 355, 125 A.2d 827 (1956).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that a jury separated without leave of court after case had been committed to them, and afterwards came together and agreed, afforded no reason per se and as mere matter of law for a new trial. Downer v. Baxter, 30 Vt. 467 (1857).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jurors may not separate after being sworn in a capital case. State v. Godfrey, Brayt. 170 (1817).

         4. Witness as officer in charge.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Fact that officer having charge of jury in case in which he was witness was present during their deliberations after it had been submitted to them, was not sufficient cause for setting aside verdict, although it was an impropriety, and another officer ought to have been selected. State v. Flint, 60 Vt. 304, 14 A. 178 (1888).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not legal error to put sheriff who was also material witness in charge of jury where no injury was shown in consequence. State v. Lockwood, 58 Vt. 378, 3 A. 539 (1886).

        The law does not attempt to prescribe the length of time which a jury should take to arrive at a verdict. State v. Lumbra, 122 Vt. 467, 177 A.2d 356 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court should cause the jury to reconsider its verdict if it considers that their decision is so hasty as to indicate, in the circumstances, either a flippant disregard or a perfunctory performance of their duties. State v. Lumbra, 122 Vt. 467, 177 A.2d 356 (1962).

        Recharging a jury on the matter of damages, calling its attention to this section, raised questions analogous to those arising upon motion to set aside a verdict for inadequacy of damages. Goldberg v. Gintoff, 112 Vt. 43, 20 A.2d 114 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        No error appeared in court's resubmission of verdict pursuant to this section when section was read to jury and court specifically directed that matter was wholly in jury's control and court added that a duplicate form for verdict would be available if needed.

       <p>
        When trial court requires jury to reconsider its verdict under this section, because of amount of award, propriety of action taken presents substantially same question that arises when verdict is set aside for insufficiency of damages, and discretionary ruling of trial court will not be disturbed, nor first assessment be reinstated, unless evidence is so strongly in its favor as to leave no room for contrary verdict.

        Where, following return of verdict later questioned on appeal as being insufficient in that it either ignored damages figures on each side, or awarded no damages at all, court inquired of counsel whether there were any matters to be taken up before discharge of jury, and neither counsel suggested anything, that was the appropriate time to settle any concern as to the manner in which the verdict was reached.

         1. New trial.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Fact that jurors, during trial, were allowed to have liquor with their meals that was paid for by officers in charge of jury, coupled with contradictory and confusing instructions given to jurors at opening of term of court as to function of jurors as law enforcement officers, constituted circumstances capable of influencing jurors favorable to State, and required new trial. State v. Ovitt, 126 Vt. 320, 229 A.2d 237 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where party during trial gave drinks of intoxicating liquor to jurors by way of treat, verdict should be set aside and a new trial granted, not only under express provisions of section, but for reasons of public policy independent of the statute. Parkhurst v. Healy, 95 Vt. 357, 115 A. 491 (1921), same case 96 Vt. 180, 118 A. 585, 97 Vt. 295, 122 A. 895.

         2. Application to criminal cases.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Although section had no application in criminal cases, respondent should have been granted a new trial where there was sufficient reason to believe that a verdict had been returned against him in consequence of corruption practiced upon jurymen by an officer or by someone else. State v. Costa, 78 Vt. 198, 62 A. 38 (1905).

         3. Tobacco.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Treating jurors with cigars has been held an act within intendment of this section. Austin & McCargar v. Langlois, 81 Vt. 223, 69 A. 739 (1908), same case 83 Vt. 104, 74 A. 489. Shattuck v. Wrought Iron Range Co., 69 Vt. 468, 38 A. 72 (1897); Baker v. Jacobs, 64 Vt. 197, 23 A. 588 (1891).

         4. Treating where town a party.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where town was party to suit, mere furnishing of food and drink by inhabitants of town, confined within limits of ordinary hospitality, without improper design, and where it had no improper influence on verdict, was not fairly within mischief which statute was designed to guard against. Carlisle v. Sheldon, 38 Vt. 440 (1866).
       </p>
       <p>
        Inhabitant of town was not such a "party" as the statute contemplated; treating must be at expense of town, or act of its authorized agents. Carlisle v. Sheldon, 38 Vt. 440 (1866).

        Determination of whether trespass is willful and malicious and should be so certified is left to sound judicial discretion of trial court, and within such limits is not revisable; but either granting the certificate without evidence or refusing to grant the certificate when trespass was willful and malicious as a matter of law, would be reversible error.

       <p>
        To entitle plaintiff, in an action of trespass quare clausum fregit, to recover full costs, when costs exceed damages, plaintiff's right of title, or right of possession, must be brought in question upon trial. Powers v. Leach, 22 Vt. 226 (1850).

       <p>
        Where appeal is taken from judgment exceeding seven dollars in an action of slander and plaintiff finally recovered no greater sum than seven dollars, he was restricted to no more costs than damages. Robinson v. Whitcher, 2 Vt. 563 (1829); Harris v. Lawrence, 1 Tyl. 164 (1801), same case 1 Tyl. 156.

       </p>
       <p>
        When, in action for slanderous words, verdict was found in county court for plaintiff, for a sum which did not surmount seven dollars, the county court on review could not tax the costs until the ratio of taxation was found, i.e., until judgment. Dwinells v. Aikin, 2 Tyl. 75 (1802).

        Where in trespass for cutting and drawing away trees, the original declaration was for treble damages but before trial plaintiff, without objection and without terms being either claimed or imposed, filed a new count for the same acts of the defendant declaring for single damages only, the issue on each count was the same and defendant was not entitled to costs to the time of the filing of the new count.

        In an action of trover for the conversion of several articles where the plaintiff failed to recover all that he sued for, the defendant was not entitled under this section to an apportionment of the costs, as only a single issue was made by the pleadings. Ross v. White, 60 Vt. 558, 15 A. 184 (1888).
       </p>
       <p>
        Section applied in cases where the issues and claims were several and distinct or to issues and claims made by the pleadings and had no reference to the constituent parts of a single general issue or claim or to those arising on the testimony on trial. Brainerd v. Casey, 37 Vt. 479 (1865).
       </p>
       <p>
        In book account the county court had a discretionary power to deny full costs to the plaintiff if he failed to sustain his whole claim. Watts v. Kavanagh, 35 Vt. 34 (1861).

       <p>
        In this section "knowingly" is used in the sense of "intentionally," meaning that the party charged was aware of the illegality of his conduct. Crawford v. Joslyn, 83 Vt. 361, 76 A. 108 (1910).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant had taxed and received fees for twenty miles travel, when there was evidence tending to show that the charge should have been for nineteen miles, the defendant was entitled to a directed verdict in the absence of any evidence tending to show that the overcharge was knowingly made. Weightman v. Jones, 73 Vt. 353, 50 A. 1101 (1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where sheriff charged and received fees for services not enumerated in the statute, in good faith and with no intent to violate the law, he was not liable to the penalty imposed by this section. Haynes v. Hall, 37 Vt. 20 (1864).
       </p>
       <p>
        An officer who received illegal fees was not liable to the penalty imposed by this section, unless he received such illegal fees knowingly. Henry v. Tilson, 17 Vt. 479 (1845).

        An officer was liable for the penalty imposed for receiving illegal fees to the party from whom he received the illegal fees notwithstanding that that party subsequently obtained judgment in his favor in which the fees charged by the officer were taxed in the bill of cost and paid to him by the other party to that suit.

       When the petitioner has been prevented from taking or entering an appeal in a probate proceeding by fraud, accident, or mistake, on petition and proof thereof, the Supreme or Superior Court in its discretion may grant leave to file a notice of appeal from an order, sentence, decree, or denial of the Probate Division of the Superior Court or from a determination of commissioners on the estate of a deceased person in those cases which are by law appealable.

         Where failure to perfect appeal was due to mistake of probate judge, belated appeal was allowed by lower court and its decision, in the exercise of its discretion, was not reviewable. Lillie v. Lillie's Est., 56 Vt. 714 (1884), same case 55 Vt. 470.

         Where recognizance attached to petition for new trial was conditioned only for payment of costs and prosecution of petition, process was void and petition should have been dismissed, since section requires that such recognizance also be conditioned for payment of intervening damages.

        </p>
        <p>
         Under this section, recognizance on petition for a new trial must be entered into before a Justice of the Supreme Court; and a master in chancery, not being an "officer duly authorized for that purpose," recognizance entered into before him is void, and being void nothing done by justice, court, or party could make it valid.

         Recognizance taken upon a petition to the county court for a new trial in a justice suit became, where the new trial was granted, security in the principal action and a matter of record in the Supreme Court where the suit was finally determined. Shumway v. Sargeant, 27 Vt. 440 (1855).

         In petition for new trial of action tried in county court, it was not necessary that petitioner give security for costs to adverse party, on issuing citation, as was required on issuing of writs of summons. Durkee v. Marshall, 14 Vt. 559 (1842).

        2383, a "final order" and that, therefore, husband should have appealed within 30 days of the order. To be final and appealable an order must end litigation on the merits or conclusively determine the rights of the parties, leaving nothing for the court to do but execute the judgment. After the court set aside the stipulation, because the issues of parental rights and responsibilities and property distribution remained for further consideration, this order was not final, and husband's appeal, filed within 30 days of the September 15, 1995 order awarding parental rights and responsibilities and $7500 to wife, was timely. Putnam v. Putnam, 166 Vt. 108, 689 A.2d 446 (1996).

        A complaint seeking de novo review in superior court of an order of the division of rate setting of the agency of human services must be filed within 30 days from the date of entry of the order; claims that the division's actions were improper may not be cited to excuse untimely filing. LD & MD, Inc. v. State, 154 Vt. 384, 576 A.2d 1244 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        A letter from the division of rate setting of the agency of human services, which demanded payment representing recaptured depreciation from the proceeds of the sale of a nursing home, was an agency order which triggered the running of the appeal period. LD & MD, Inc. v. State, 154 Vt. 384, 576 A.2d 1244 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where judgment was filed on September 5 and appellant received notice of it on September 8, notice of appeal filed on October 9 was too late to preserve Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction. Village of Northfield v. Chittenden Trust Co., 128 Vt. 240, 260 A.2d 406 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        The jurisdictional demands of an appeal statute must be fully complied with within the time prescribed. Badger v. Rice, 124 Vt. 82, 196 A.2d 503 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        In computing the thirty-day period, the date when the judgment was entered is not included. Rice Lumber Co. v. Baslow, 123 Vt. 443, 194 A.2d 65 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        The thirty-day period specified in this section is determined by the time of recording the judgment rather than the time of rendition of judgment. Rice Lumber Co. v. Baslow, 123 Vt. 443, 194 A.2d 65 (1963).
       </p>

        The record on appeal should clearly and definitely indicate the date when the clerk mails or delivers copies of the judgment order and the date when the appellant mails or delivers his notice of appeal. Rice Lumber Co. v. Baslow, 123 Vt. 443, 194 A.2d 65 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a distinction between the rendition of a judgment and the entry of judgment in the official record of the court, the first being a judicial act of the court and the second a ministerial act of the clerk in recording what has been adjudicated. Rice Lumber Co. v. Baslow, 123 Vt. 443, 194 A.2d 65 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        The requirement as to time of filing notice of appeal is mandatory, and, once time has expired, court is left without authority to act. State v. Brown, 121 Vt. 459, 160 A.2d 879 (1960), cert. denied, 365 U.S. 822, 81 S. Ct. 706, 5 L. Ed. 2d 699 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prior to 1961 amendment to this section, notice of appeal had to be filed within 30 days after conformed copy of any appealable judgment, order, ruling, decree or sentence had been mailed or delivered by hand to attorney of record for appealing party, or to appealing party if he had no attorney of record.

        Superior Court lacked jurisdiction to review an order of the division of rate setting of the agency of human services, which demanded payment representing recaptured depreciation from the sale of a nursing home, where nursing home owner filed its complaint nearly one year after the recapture decision was made.

       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to file a notice of appeal within the period specified by this section ends Supreme Court's authority to grant review under its provisions. Village of Northfield v. Chittenden Trust Co., 128 Vt. 240, 260 A.2d 406 (1969).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Statute regarding passing causes before final judgment does not require the Vermont Supreme Court to decide interlocutory appeals. State v. Haynes, 210 Vt. 417, 215 A.3d 1094 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not require as prerequisites to an appeal that a hearing be held on the drafting of questions of law and that appellee receive notice of the questions proposed for review. Wilbur v. Univ. of Vermont, 129 Vt. 33, 270 A.2d 889 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        That the facts underlying some of the questions presented on review of refusal to dismiss complaint were put in issue by defendant's answer did not prevent review; in reviewing the order refusing dismissal, the facts alleged and exhibited with the complaint are taken as true, and likewise, the answers to the certified questions are to be given in the context of the facts stated in the complaint. Wilbur v. Univ. of Vermont, 129 Vt. 33, 270 A.2d 889 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, claimed defects appropriate for raising by pre-trial motion should be preserved by such motion, thus making them available for testing by certification, if warranted by their nature and contents. In re Provencher, 127 Vt. 558, 255 A.2d 180 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        There are two steps involved in bringing questions to the Supreme Court before final judgment. The first is to obtain recorded permission from the court concerned to bring up to the Supreme Court the questions to be decided, and failure to do this means failure to confer the jurisdiction necessary to deal with the case at all at that point. The second step, required by Supreme Court Rule 2A[2], is to obtain from the certifying court a signed statement of the questions to be presented in the Supreme Court for review. Even though jurisdiction may have been conferred by step one, if the statement of questions is lacking, the Supreme Court may refuse to accept the attempted certification. State v. Mahoney, 126 Vt. 258, 227 A.2d 401 (1967).

         2. Order prior to final judgment.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        It is a general rule that an appeal should not be permitted in criminal causes until a final verdict adverse to defendant has been rendered, but under this section, courts have discretion to permit an appeal before judgment for the determination of questions of law. State v. Blondin, 128 Vt. 613, 270 A.2d 165 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order assessing against defendant certain charges and expenses allegedly brought about by necessity of a mistrial was clearly interlocutory and, there having been no certification by the trial court, Supreme Court lacked jurisdiction to hear the appeal. Cote v. White, 127 Vt. 210, 243 A.2d 797 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court's failure to rule on defendant's motion to appeal before judgment within 30-day period did not require rejection of interlocutory appeal, where delay resulted from plaintiff's request for hearing on motion and trial court was unable to conduct a hearing within a 30-day period. Wilbur v. U.V.M. & S.A.C., 127 Vt. 283, 247 A.2d 897 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section requires a discretionary ruling by the court below to enable the Supreme Court to review an interlocutory order. Putney v. Brookline, 126 Vt. 194, 225 A.2d 388 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where party appealed a probate court order to county court and upon affirmance there appealed to the Supreme Court, the jurisdictional defect present where the order was not final was fatal to the appeal and could not be overlooked, nor cured by waiver, concession or agreement. In re Estate of Pierce, 125 Vt. 340, 215 A.2d 505 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the provisions of this section appeals before final judgment can only be taken by permission of the court whose order is sought to be reviewed, and where no permission was obtained there is no appellate jurisdiction. Woodard v. Porter Hospital, Inc., 125 Vt. 264, 214 A.2d 67 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        A municipal court has no jurisdiction of a prosecution after nolle prosequi has been entered and cannot thereafter certify such case for appeal before final judgment pursuant to this section. State v. Robinson, 124 Vt. 225, 204 A.2d 163 (1964).

        In general, a defendant in a criminal case should not be permitted to appeal until after a final judgment adverse to him has been entered in trial court, and practice of certifying, before judgment, appropriate questions on agreement of the parties and in the discretion of the presiding judge and where the disposition thereof would in at least one alternative finally dispose of the action, will be most strictly applied.

        Contention that accused was denied a speedy trial in prior case wherein State had charged accused with manslaughter and had entered a nolle prosequi was improperly urged, and would not be considered, on appeal from denial of motion to quash information filed by State in subsequent case, in which State charged accused with manslaughter and four other offenses; and opinion on appeal in prior case disposed of the questions in that case.

        It is crucial that exact nature and scope of certified questions relied upon be made evident, and such can be accomplished only when law questions have been formulated and framed by court below and certified as required by statute, as Supreme Court, as well as parties, are then apprised or defined and precise issues to be answered and sufficiently so to enable Supreme Court to render its decision and dispose of such questions.

        The court would review the lawfulness of the confinement of post-conviction relief petitioner who plead guilty and did not, by pre-trial motion, preserve for review claimed defects appropriately raised by such motion, in light of unfamiliarity of the requirements set by instant case with respect to the preservation, by one who pleads guilty, of claimed defects appropriately raised by pre-trial motion and in light of broad scope of review in post-conviction relief proceedings and the attendant discretionary powers. In re Provencher, 127 Vt. 558, 255 A.2d 180 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        One who fails to preserve by motion those claimed defects which are appropriate for raising by pre-trial motion exposes himself to an allegation of waiver and must, in the usual case, abide the consequence. In re Provencher, 127 Vt. 558, 255 A.2d 180 (1969).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Where there was no appeal from decree of probate court by which estate of intestate was assigned to his widow or children, decree became binding to same extent as any other judgment, and could not be impeached collaterally. Boyden v. Ward, 38 Vt. 628 (1866).
       </p>
       <p>
        In case of appeals from probate court which come into Supreme Court on exceptions to decision of county court, Supreme Court sits only as a court of error to revise decisions of county court upon question of law. Clark v. Heirs of Clark, 21 Vt. 490 (1849).

         2. Review on exceptions.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        If exceptions showed that county court decided case upon ground that court had no power to correct decree of distribution, or if appeal were from decree of distribution, then a question of law would be presented which Supreme Court could revise. Hutchinson v. Hutchinson's Est., 38 Vt. 700 (1866).
       </p>
       <p>
        When heirs took exceptions to decisions of county court in allowing an administrator's account and exceptions were all overruled by Supreme Court, Supreme Court would not proceed to examine questions decided against administrator by county court, in reference to which no exceptions were taken, as they would do if any of exceptions taken by heirs had been sustained.

       <p>
        On direct appeal from final probate decree, Supreme Court will review only "pure" questions of law, resolution of which does not depend upon factual distinctions and does not require review of record. In re Estate of Johnson, 158 Vt. 557, 613 A.2d 703 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme Court has jurisdiction under this section to consider questions of law on direct appeal from probate court. In re Estate of Davis, 125 Vt. 446, 218 A.2d 390 (1966).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Appeal from probate court order denying termination of parental rights was transferred to Superior Court; question whether existence of guardianship constituted good cause for parents' nonsupport of minors, although framed as a question of law, necessarily required careful review of record as a whole and particular facts and circumstances of case, and was therefore beyond Supreme Court's jurisdiction. In re J.C., 169 Vt. 139, 730 A.2d 588 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Question whether probate court adequately addressed requisite statutory criteria in determining whether termination of parental rights was in best interests of children was beyond scope of Supreme Court's appellate review, since it would involve considering evidentiary record as a whole, which was precisely the type of fact-specific issue reserved for probate court in the first instance, and for superior court on de novo review. In re J.C., 169 Vt. 139, 730 A.2d 588 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where factual distinctions could control resolution of issue presented from probate proceeding, issue is not appropriate for review by Supreme Court. In re Estate of Johnson, 158 Vt. 557, 613 A.2d 703 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where resolution of issues presented on appeal from final probate decree, which involved admission of character evidence, waiver of dead man's statute, and rebut table presumption of revocation of lost will, required consideration of particular procedural and substantive facts of case, they were more appropriately addressed in Superior Court than in Supreme Court. In re Estate of Johnson, 158 Vt. 557, 613 A.2d 703 (1992).

        On appeal county court sat as higher court of probate with co-extensive jurisdiction and it was as necessary to make an affirmative showing of jurisdiction as in the probate court from which appeal was taken. Roddy v. Fitzgerald Est., 113 Vt. 472, 35 A.2d 668 (1944).

        Beneficiaries of testator's will were "persons interested" in probate court order restricting fees recoverable by executor and his attorney and distributing excess assets to beneficiaries and were entitled to be parties to executor's and his attorney's appeal de novo to the county court.

        Interest required to support appeal must be a legal interest which may, by such order or decree, be either enlarged or diminished. In re Manley Est., 112 Vt. 314, 24 A.2d 357 (1942); Peck's Adm'r v. Peck's Adm'r, 91 Vt. 91, 99 A. 635 (1917); In re Clark's Est., 79 Vt. 62, 64 A. 231 (1906).

        Creditor of estate whose claim was allowed by commissioners in full but was reduced by more than twenty dollars by allowance of offsets, was not entitled to an appeal on grounds that his claim was disallowed to that amount; but he could prove his claim under administrator's appeal, if pleadings allowed. Thorp v. Thorp's Est., 75 Vt. 34, 52 A. 1051 (1902), same case 70 Vt. 46, 39 Atl. 245.
       </p>
       <p>
        County court could permit plaintiff upon trial of appeal from allowance of commissioners to raise ad damnum of declaration filed in probate court, where claim presented to commissioners and that tried in county court were identical. Maughan v. Burns, 64 Vt. 316, 23 A. 583 (1892).

        Where person was owner of two demands, one in favor of himself and another, and one in favor of himself and a third person, he was not entitled to an appeal if commissioners did not disallow twenty dollars on one of demands; the sums disallowed on both could not be added together to make that amount.

         3. Bond requirement.

       <p>
        This section requires that person appealing from decision of commissioners in lieu of estate's representative who declines so to do must give a bond to protect estate from financial loss resulting from his failure to prosecute appeal to effect. In re Estate of Rushford, 111 Vt. 494, 18 A.2d 175 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where bond filed on appeal by heirs from decision and report of commissioners in decedent estate was conditioned to pay all intervening damages and costs occasioned by said appeal to claimants of any of them, adverse parties to the appeal were sufficiently identified under name of claimants to comply with requirements of this section, although it would have been more proper to name them. In re Estate of Delligan, 110 Vt. 294, 6 A.2d 1 (1939), same case 111 Vt. 227, 13 A.2d 282.

        1064, were sufficiently cognate to be in pari materia, since both relate to allowance of costs taxed against administrator in his administration account, and they were to be construed with reference to each other as parts of one system, and legislative intent, thus ascertained, given effect.

        Costs in probate appeals may be denied in discretion of court. Panton v. Noonan, 112 Vt. 138, 22 A.2d 174 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was discretionary with court to allow or refuse costs on appeals from court of probate. Reynolds v. McGregor, 16 Vt. 191 (1844); Phelps v. Heirs of Slade, 10 Vt. 192 (1838), same case 13 Vt. 195.

       <p>
        In absence of any declaration to contrary, it was to be understood that costs in Supreme Court were awarded to prevailing party. Bliss v. Little's Est., 64 Vt. 133, 23 A. 725 (1891), same case 63 Vt. 86, 22 Atl. 12.
       </p>
       <p>
        Where creditor of estate appealed from decision of commissioners allowing balance against him in favor of estate, and in the county court he recovered judgment in his favor for damages and costs, execution for the costs was properly issued by county court against administrator personally, as for his own debt. O'Hear v. Skeeles, 22 Vt. 152 (1850).
       </p>
       <p>
        General rule that party prevailing was entitled to costs was applicable to case of an appeal by executors from a decree of probate court disallowing a will. Heirs of Brigham v. Executors of Brigham, 15 Vt. 788 (1843).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appellant recovering his claim that was earlier disallowed must recover cost. Stark's Adm'r v. Sawyer's Ex'r, 3 Vt. 372 (1831).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Questions as to costs in county court can only be properly brought before Supreme Court by having costs taxed and question decided in lower court and certified up as part of the case. Bliss v. Little's Est., 64 Vt. 133, 23 A. 725 (1891), same case 63 Vt. 86, 22 Atl. 12.
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme Court had no discretion in allowance of costs accruing in county court upon trial of an appeal from probate court. Bliss v. Little's Est., 64 Vt. 133, 23 A. 725 (1891), same case 63 Vt. 86, 22 Atl. 12.
       </p>
       <p>
        Where appeal was from a decree of probate court, passing to Supreme Court upon exceptions from county court, Supreme Court could make no order as to costs, except costs occurring in that court. Jones v. Knappen, 63 Vt. 391, 22 A. 630 (1891).

       <p>
        In an action of scire facias against bail to maintain which it is necessary to show return of non est inventus on execution against principal within time fixed by law, return of officer was, in the absence of fraud, conclusive as to time when return was made. Yatter v. Pitkin, 72 Vt. 255, 47 A. 787 (1900), same case 66 Vt. 300, 29 A. 370.

        Where debtor had not been confined in jail on the original process, this section fixes the starting point when execution may first issue as 30 days after final judgment, except by special permission. In re Waterhouse, 125 Vt. 202, 212 A.2d 696 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where term of court at which party recovered final judgment ended on Saturday, Monday was first day on which party was entitled to take out execution; and that day was to be excluded in computation of the thirty days within which property attached on original writ must be demanded of attaching officer by officer holding execution, in order to charge property.

       <p>
        Sale of real estate upon execution must be completed within five months from rendition of final judgment in order to preserve an attachment lien. Whipple v. Sheldon, 63 Vt. 197, 21 A. 271 (1890).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where execution sale was not completed until seven months after final judgment, creditor did not connect sale with attachment, and title of defendant, who purchased after the attachment, was superior, if he bought the premises in good faith. Whipple v. Sheldon, 63 Vt. 197, 21 A. 271 (1890).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where execution was actually levied on land attached on mesne process, and appraisal made within five calendar months after rendition of final judgment, but levy was not recorded in town clerk's office until after five months had expired, levy was not in season to connect it with attachment lien.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        When property is attached on mesne process, delivery of execution to officer, who made attachment within thirty days from rendition of judgment, was a taking of property in execution within meaning of statute, so far as respects support of lien of creditor. Bliss v. Stevens, 4 Vt. 88 (1831); Ayer v. Jameson, 9 Vt. 363 (1837); Enos v. Brown, 1 D. Chip. 280 (1814).
       </p>
       <p>
        When creditor's lien was kept good by delivering execution to officer within thirty days, a demand of property of receiptors, after first thirty days and in life of execution, was sufficient to charge them. Bliss v. Stevens, 4 Vt. 88 (1831).

        .
       </h5>
       <p>
        When property had been attached by an officer and execution was delivered to another officer, property attached was not charged in execution without a demand of property of attaching officer, notwithstanding execution had been taken out and delivered to second officer within thirty days after judgment, and notwithstanding property had been entirely consumed by debtor before judgment was rendered on which the execution issued. Collins v. Smith, 16 Vt. 9 (1844).
       </p>
       <p>
        If property is attached by a deputized person, to charge such property in execution, execution must be delivered to same person within thirty days after judgment, or if delivered to another officer it must be demanded or taken by him within thirty days or attachment is dissolved. Clark v. Washburn, 9 Vt. 302 (1837); Dewey v. Fay, 34 Vt. 138 (1861); Blodgett v. Adams, 24 Vt. 23 (1851).

       <p>
        When body of debtor is committed upon execution, all liens created by attachment are lost; and if creditor subsequently releases body of debtor, and takes execution against his goods and estate, it only gives him a new and independent remedy, and does not revive any lien created by original attachment.

       When a subsequent attaching creditor recovers judgment while a prior action is pending, on which the same property is attached, he or she may take an execution on such judgment at any time within 30 days after all prior attachments are discharged, if the property attached is personal property, and, if real estate, within five months after the prior attachments are discharged, though more than a year and a day have passed after the rendition of such judgment.
    If an execution was taken out at the time of the rendition of such judgment, which is unsatisfied, the plaintiff may take out other executions thereon within the time aforesaid, though the judgment has lain dormant for more than a year and a day. Such execution, or other executions, if so taken out, shall hold the lien on the goods or estate so attached, if put into the hands of the attaching officer within 30 days after the discharge of all liens on such property, if the property was personal, or five months, if real estate.

      When an execution is levied on real or personal estate, and it afterwards appears that the estate did not belong to the debtor, or was encumbered by a mortgage not regarded in a sale thereof on execution, by reason of which the levy and sale are void, the court, upon motion, notice, and hearing, may issue an execution for the original execution, or so much thereof as was satisfied by the levy, and the costs thereon with interest on the same from the time of the levy, and the costs of the motion.

      Where an execution has been levied on real estate and the levy, sale, or deed is irregular, informal, or not according to law and the title derived therefrom is doubtful, within two years from the time of sale, a party interested may bring an action in the Superior Court, setting forth in the complaint the respects in which it is claimed the proceedings on the execution were irregular, informal, and not according to law. Upon hearing, the presiding judge may grant the plaintiff and all parties interested such relief as is equitable.

        Statute includes all such informalities or irregularities as would render the levy doubtful, or even bad, but not extending to the subject matter of the levy; it includes such levy as merely neglects to state that the justice, appointing the appraisers, was qualified to judge between the parties.

        Where appraisers were appointed partly from both towns, defect, if any, in mode of appointing them was merely informal and cured by neglect of both parties to apply two years to vacate the levy. Perrin v. Reed, 35 Vt. 2 (1861), same case 33 Vt. 62 Ross v. Shurtleff, 55 Vt. 177 (1882).

        Defect in levy of execution upon undivided interest of an heir in the real estate of the ancestor in not stating amount of interest of such heir in estate was at most a mere defect in form which was cured after lapse of two years without action by either party.

        Audita querela was appropriate remedy to vacate levy of execution on real estate, when, through fraud of creditor, officer made a false return of appraisal, and set off too much of debtor's property, when this irregularity did not appear upon the face of the officer's return.

        "Public place" meant place where advertisement would be likely to attract general attention so that its contents might reasonably be expected to become a matter of notoriety; a barn, dwelling house, shed, or even a rock or tree, if answering this condition, could be a public place within meaning of statute. Austin v. Soule, 36 Vt. 645 (1864).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no presumption, without proof, that places described in an officer's return of the levy of an execution on personal property, as places where the sale was advertised and took place, were not public places. Drake v. Mooney, 31 Vt. 617 (1859).

        Where officer advertised property other than hay, grain, etc., taken in execution at one place for sale at another place, and sold it accordingly, he thereby became a trespasser ab initio, and liable for full value of property, notwithstanding he applied the proceeds of sale upon execution. Evarts v. Burgess, 48 Vt. 205 (1876).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an officer sold property on execution at a different place from that named in the notice, without adjournment to such place or consent of the execution debtor, he became a trespasser ab initio, and liable in an action of trespass to debtor for full value of property, although officer paid over to debtor proceeds of sale. Hall v. Ray, 40 Vt. 576 (1868).
       </p>
       <p>
        Officer could, in exercise of a sound and reasonable discretion, change by adjournment both time and place appointed for sale of property taken in execution, provided it was to a place which he was authorized to appoint as place of sale in first instance. Jewett v. Guyer, 38 Vt. 209 (1865).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where property was attached in one town and taken into another by officer, and there held until execution issued against owner, and there levied upon, advertisement and sale upon execution should be made in the town where property was originally attached. Collins v. Perkins, 31 Vt. 624 (1859).
       </p>
       <p>
        When character and situation of personal property upon which an execution is levied, and interests of parties require it, officer may in his sound discretion, and in good faith, advertise and sell it at more than one place. Drake v. Mooney, 31 Vt. 617 (1859).

        No one but owner of property, or some person representing him, can call in question the attachment and sale. Sanborn v. Kittredge & Morrill, 20 Vt. 632 (1848).
       </p>
       <p>
        If sheriff's sale of property was valid as against debtor, it was also valid as against his creditors, so far as it could be sustained independently of any consent of debtor, and was free from all collusion on his part. Wood v. Doane, 20 Vt. 612 (1848).

       <p>
        Purchaser of personal property at sheriff's sale acquired thereby no better title to property than debtor had. Sanborn v. Kittredge & Morrill, 20 Vt. 632 (1848); Griffith v. Fowler, 18 Vt. 390 (1846).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any informality in proceedings of sheriff would not defeat title of purchaser, if proceedings were substantially in conformity to law, even where it appeared upon face of return. Wood v. Doane, 20 Vt. 612 (1848).
       </p>
       <p>
        Purchaser of personal chattels at sheriff's sale was not affected by any irregularity or impropriety in officer's proceedings, but officer was liable therefor to party injured. Administrator of Janes v. Martin, 7 Vt. 92 (1835).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Where proceedings of officer on execution were in substantial compliance with law, and operated by their legal force, unaided by any consent of judgment debtor to transfer to purchaser title of property sold thereunder, sale, though somewhat informal and defective, was a good sheriff's sale, and protected purchaser in his right to property without a change of possession. Fitzpatrick v. Peabody, 51 Vt. 195 (1878); Bates v. Carter, 5 Vt. 602 (1831).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sheriff's sales are an exception to the general principle that sales of personal chattels unaccompanied by a visible and substantial change of possession are inoperative as against creditors of vendor. Austin v. Soule, 36 Vt. 645 (1864).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where personal property sold consisted in part of a quantity of mill logs, which were lying on ice and banks of a river to which they had been drawn for purpose of being floated down to a mill, and no actual possession of logs was taken by vendee, but vendor exercised no further control over them, and residue of property embraced in sale passed into possession of vendee, the sale was valid, without any actual removal, as against a creditor of vendor, who attached logs with knowledge of sale.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where sheriff sold property at public auction on an execution to his agent, and agent bid it off with tacit understanding that sheriff was to have it and pay for it, execution creditor being ignorant of transaction, such sale could be declared void by a court of equity. Downing v. Lyford & Senter, 57 Vt. 507 (1885).
       </p>
       <p>
        An officer who acted in sale of property upon execution merely by force of his process could not make a sale of such property to himself, and did not, by such attempted sale, acquire even a defeasible title to property, good against all persons but debtor and creditor.

       <p>
        Charges of an officer for keeping property during pendency of action under which attachment was made constitute a lien upon property, which must be satisfied before proceeds of sale are applied upon the execution; and it is not necessary in order to preserve this lien that these charges should be taxed as costs and included in execution; but this priority of lien extends only to avails of property itself which is so kept and an officer is not justified in applying to satisfaction of such untaxed charges, in preference to payment of execution, money which he receives from one who has become recognized to plaintiff for costs, and who makes such payment in satisfaction of his liability under such recognizance.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where the legislature has intended to exempt property traceable to the receipt of certain benefits, it has said so explicitly. By omitting such language from the statute stating that workers' compensation are not assignable, the legislature obviously left the question of a creditor's right to various assets to the specific provisions set forth in the statute exempting certain articles from attachment and execution. Geraw v. Geraw, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (June 11, 2021).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The basic policy underlying Vermont exemption of certain items from the bankruptcy estate is to promote a "fresh start" by allowing a debtor to keep property that the legislature deems essential to living and working; Vermont courts have long held that the exemption statutes are remedial in nature and ought to receive a liberal construction in favor of the debtor. In re Parrotte, 22 F.3d 472 (2d Cir. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Section is remedial and should be construed liberally in favor of the debtor. Webster v. Orne, 45 Vt. 40 (1868).

        Where officer attached goods and sold same on an execution, and purchaser took the receipt of a third person in whose possession they were for the same, trespass could be sustained against officer, if property was not liable to attachment. Hart v. Hyde, 5 Vt. 328 (1833).

        Statute exempting certain property from attachment and execution did not embrace extents against delinquent collectors of town taxes. Hackett v. Amsden, 56 Vt. 201 (1883), same case 57 Vt. 432, 59 Vt. 553, 8 A. 737.

       <p>
        Where exemption of property from attachment is of specific things in numero, number of things exempt is not doubled when ownership is of an undivided half of each; thus, one who owns an undivided half of a yoke of oxen, of a yoke of steers, and of more than twenty sheep, is entitled to an exemption in either the oxen or the steers, and in ten of the sheep - not in both oxen and steers, and in twenty sheep.

       <p>
        A judgment debtor may claim an exemption from attachment more than once, even against the same creditor, if debtor does not have funds in his possession at any one time in excess of amount of his exemption. Licursi v. Sweeney, 157 Vt. 599, 603 A.2d 342 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court in post-judgment trustee process case erred in holding that defendant could not assert same attachment exemption in two separate actions, where both plain language and purpose of governing statute were at odds with this conclusion, and it would be irrational to allow specific exemptions against only the first of several attaching creditors. Licursi v. Sweeney, 157 Vt. 599, 603 A.2d 342 (1991).

         9. "Wildcard" exemption.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Debtor could exempt any proceeds from certain lawsuits he had pending, up to the limit imposed by the wild card exemption, because the debtor could use the wild card exemption to shield proceeds of a lawsuit from his creditors as such proceeds fell within broad definition of "any property;" and plaintiffs failed to demonstrate a factual or legal basis for denying the claimed wild card exemption based upon equitable grounds. In re Mick, - B.R. - (Bankr. D. Vt. Sept. 24, 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        The "wildcard" exemption of subsection (7) clearly caps subsections (1), (2), (4), (5) and (6) but no other subsections, including subsection (18) dealing with life insurance policies. In re Gabelhart, 138 B.R. 425 (Bankr. D. Vt. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        The term "any property" in subsection (7) means just that, any property, including real property; thus the "wildcard" exemption may be applied towards debtor in bankruptcy's real property. In re Christie, 139 B.R. 612 (Bankr. D. Vt. 1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court in post-judgment trustee process case erred in denying defendant benefit of additional exemption for "unused amount" of other enumerated exemptions, even though attachment did not cover any of the enumerated items, where nothing on face of governing provision required ownership of property or interest for which exemption was claimed. Licursi v. Sweeney, 157 Vt. 599, 603 A.2d 342 (1991).

       <p>
        Consideration of property to determine whether it falls within the "tools of the trade" exemption must be based on the function or use of the property in the debtor's trade, rather than its size or type. In re Parrotte, 22 F.3d 472 (2d Cir. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        The lack of a specific reference to bulls in Vermont's exemption relating to cattle does not preclude a "tools of the trade" exemption for bulls. In re Parrotte, 22 F.3d 472 (2d Cir. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where bulls were used by debtor-dairy farmers as necessary instruments in the ultimate process of producing milk for sale, the bulls came within Vermont's "tools of the trade" exemption. In re Parrotte, 22 F.3d 472 (2d Cir. 1994).

       <p>
        Actual use of a horse is not essential to its exemption from attachment; it may be exempt when kept with an honest intention of using it for team work within a reasonable time. Steele v. Lyford, 59 Vt. 230, 8 A. 736 (1886); Rowell v. Powell, 53 Vt. 302 (1880); Hickok v. Thayer, 49 Vt. 372 (1877); Webster v. Orne, 45 Vt. 40 (1868).
       </p>
       <p>
        A colt, not exempt under statute as being kept for team work, was not exempt because it was received in exchange for a horse that was exempt. Connell v. Fisk, 54 Vt. 381 (1882).
       </p>
       <p>
        Owner could make his selection before attachment. George v. Bassett, 54 Vt. 217 (1881).

        Debtor could select from his oxen and steers yoke he would keep exempt from attachment. Haskins v. Bennett, 41 Vt. 698 (1869).

        Yoke of steer calves less than a year old were exempt, together with sufficient forage for keeping the same through the winter. Mundell v. Hammond, 40 Vt. 641 (1868).

        Trial court in post-judgment trustee process case correctly concluded that defendant's funds in possession of insurance company were not "bank deposits" or "deposit accounts," such that a portion of the funds would be exempt from attachment under governing statute, where insurance company's obligation arose from contract with third party whom defendant successfully sued, and where defendant never deposited any sums with insurance company, and company never undertook any depositary relationship with defendant.

         15. Tools of the trade.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The Vermont legislature did not undertake to define the term "tools of the trade" in their exemption statute, and in the absence of such definition the court will look to the function or use of the property, rather than the size or type, to determine if it is a tool of the debtor's trade. In re Parrotte, 22 F.3d 472 (2d Cir. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court is unwilling to exclude animals and other living creatures as tools of the trade for the purposes of bankruptcy exemptions and where the plaintiff's bulls are actually used by the debtor as instruments which are necessary in carrying on his trade they may be classified as tools of the trade. In re Parrotte, 22 F.3d 472 (2d Cir. 1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        The bankruptcy court's holding that the specific livestock exemption precludes a debtor from claiming a cow as a tool of the trade is unpersuasive when the same court has held that although there is a specific automobile exemption, automobiles may be claimed as tools of the trade under the general exemption provision. In re Parrotte, 22 F.3d 472 (2d Cir. 1994).

      When there is reasonable doubt as to the ownership of the goods or chattels or as to their liability to be taken on a writ of attachment or execution, the officer may require sufficient security to indemnify him or her for taking the same.
    If the creditor, his or her agent or attorney does not, within a reasonable time after the request, give the security to the officer, he or she may release them to the person from whom they were taken, at any time before the sale of the goods or chattels, and may take other goods or chattels, or, when permitted under section 2741 of this title, the body of the debtor, and for want thereof may return a non est inventus.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Where creditor put a writ of attachment against his debtor into hands of sheriff, and directed sheriff to attach certain property as property of debtor, and tendered to him a suitable bond of indemnity for so doing, and sheriff refused to attach the property, the creditor could not sustain an action against sheriff for such refusal, if property which sheriff was directed to attach was in fact property of a person other than debtor.

        One who had record title of real estate was in fact but a trustee thereof, his creditors, though ignorant of the trust, could acquire no right to land by attachment or levy, as against cestui que trust; and a court of chancery, in cases where trustee was in equity bound to convey property to cestui que trust, would decree a conveyance to latter from levying creditor.

        In regard to real estate conveyed by an unrecorded deed, rule is same both as to attaching creditors and purchasers from the grantor; neither can acquire any title, as against the grantee, after notice of the conveyance or of circumstances which would naturally put a careful and prudent man upon inquiry in a direction where he might learn the real state of the title. Hart v. Farmers & Mechanics' Bank, 33 Vt. 252 (1860).

        In case of a mere sale and conveyance of land by absolute owner, without notice, either actual or constructive, or any change of possession, land was still subject to levy or attachment upon debts of vendor. Hart v. Farmers & Mechanics' Bank, 33 Vt. 252 (1860).
       </p>
       <p>
        If attaching creditor had notice after his attachment but before levy that land attached did not belong to the debtor, though record title was in debtor, such notice, if true, would be sufficient to protect equitable interest of real owner against the levy.

When the debtor fails to file the bond as provided for in this section, the purchaser may have his or her writ of possession from the clerk or magistrate, and may enter and take possession and manage such real estate in a good husbandlike manner. If the defendant in such action shall redeem the same, the purchaser shall account for the fair value of the rents and profits thereof, until the same shall be redeemed.

      When the parties cannot agree as to the value of the rents and profits under section 2796 of this title, either party may apply to the clerk of the court or magistrate who issued the execution, if he or she is in office and not disqualified and if not in office or if disqualified, to any other justice or to a district judge in the county where the land lies, who could lawfully judge between the parties.
    On notice to the other party, he or she shall appoint three disinterested freeholders resident in the town in which the land or the greater part thereof lies, to act as appraisers, to appraise such rents and profits.
    They shall be sworn to the faithful performance of their duties and shall, on notice to the parties, appraise the rents and profits of the premises and also determine if any waste has been committed thereon, and return their appraisal, including damages for waste, if any has been committed, to the clerk or magistrate who appointed them; and, if he or she accepts the same, it shall be final between the parties.
    When the defendant has given the bond and remained in possession, the amount so found due shall be recoverable in an action founded on the bond.

        To avoid a voluntary conveyance that was prior to a claim, fraud must be actual and intentional. Rose v. Morrell, 128 Vt. 110, 259 A.2d 8 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        A voluntary conveyance is fraudulent in law as to existing creditors for whom ample provision has not been made, and cause of action and right to maintain a suit under this section is made out, if conveyance was voluntary, if adequate provision was not then made for payment of existing creditors, and if ultimately there is a deficiency of assets to pay claims of such creditors, although no actual fraud was intended by parties to conveyance. Vilas v. Seith, 108 Vt. 526, 189 A. 862 (1937), same case 108 Vt. 18, 183 A. 854.

        Section was merely declaratory of equitable rule that a judgment creditor could not maintain a suit in equity in aid of an execution until he had perfected his right at law as far as he could; and in order to do that, when he sought satisfaction of his execution out of real estate that had been conveyed in fraud of his rights, he must have acquired a specific lien on it by levy of his execution. Rowley v. Shepardson, 87 Vt. 57, 87 A. 528 (1913), same case 83 Vt. 167, 74 A. 1002, 85 Vt. 266, 81 A. 917, 90 Vt. 25, 96 A. 374, 91 Vt. 8, 99 A. 228.

        Where husband, in 1954, deeded property as security to parties providing bail to obtain his release from arrest in his second wife's action for child support, and such parties conveyed the property to husband and his third wife as tenants by the entirety in 1958 upon discharge of the bail bond, and plaintiff parents of second wife were awarded custody of the child involved in their daughter's support action and were also awarded a "compensatory fine" in a proceeding against husband, decree pro confesso against husband in plaintiffs' action against husband and his third wife in aid of an execution held by plaintiffs did not establish fraudulent intent on husband's part as to interest of his third wife in the property. Rose v. Morrell, 128 Vt. 110, 259 A.2d 8 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff subsequent creditors of husband with notice of prior interest of husband's wife were in no position to complain that they were hindered, delayed or defrauded by tenancy in entirety created in husband and wife shortly after wife's right against husband accrued and long before plaintiffs' right against husband accrued. Rose v. Morrell, 128 Vt. 110, 259 A.2d 8 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where wife gave valuable consideration for conveyance to her of an interest in husband's property, fraudulent intent on husband's part did not, in itself, void her estate as both grantor and grantee must have fraudulent intent to void the conveyance where valuable consideration is given. Rose v. Morrell, 128 Vt. 110, 259 A.2d 8 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        To establish that conveyance was fraudulent it is not always necessary that an intent to defraud be shown; a transaction may constitute a fraud in law though not in fact. Vilas v. Seith, 108 Vt. 18, 183 A. 854 (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        Conveyance without valuable consideration was fraudulent in law as to existing creditors for whom no ample provision had been made, and good faith of parties thereto was immaterial. Vilas v. Seith, 108 Vt. 18, 183 A. 854 (1935).

       <p>
        Where husband had conveyed away his equity in real property as security for a bail bond, reconveyance, upon discharge of bond, to husband and wife married after husband's conveyance as tenants by the entirety was not in fraud of husband's creditors where wife's interest was in consideration of prior loans and advancement to husband.

         4. Limitations.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        "Final judgment" that triggered the running of the statute of limitations for a judgment lien was a 2001 default order, which ended the litigation between the parties and finally disposed of the subject matter before the court. A 2006 order that merely set forth an agreed-upon payment plan for the 2001 debt was not a new decision on the merits, and the fact that this order might have been appealable did not change this result. Ayer v. Hemingway, 193 Vt. 610, 73 A.3d 673 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial courts routinely issue post-judgment orders that identify payments made and interest that has accrued; were a court to construe each of these orders as starting a new limitations period for a judgment lien, a party could extend the life of a judgment lien indefinitely by filing motions to reduce additional accrued interest to judgment. The statute does not contemplate this result, and the need for certainty and predictability in the law compels the Vermont Supreme Court to reject such an approach; rather, the statute of limitations runs from a single ascertainable moment - the issuance of a final judgment on the merits. Ayer v. Hemingway, 193 Vt. 610, 73 A.3d 673 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Judgment lien is effective only for eight years from the issuance of a final judgment on which it is based. Here, a default judgment was entered in 2001 and plaintiffs did not file their foreclosure complaint until 2011, outside the eight-year period; thus, the judgment lien was no longer in effect when the complaint was filed and plaintiffs were not entitled to foreclose on the judgment lien. Ayer v. Hemingway, 193 Vt. 610, 73 A.3d 673 (2013).

       <p>
        Award of statutory prejudgment and postjudgment interest did not violate due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments, as the 12 percent interest rate was reasonably related to making plaintiffs whole and thus passed rational basis review; there was no constitutional mandate that the statutory interest rate be pegged to the national prime rate.

       <p>
        Creditor's recordation of lien based on a judgment against a bankruptcy debtor before the period for appealing the judgment expired was invalid since the judgment was not final when it was recorded by the creditor as required by 12 V.S.A.
        ยงยง
        2901, 2904, thus its recordation did not create a valid judgment lien, and it was irrelevant that a title search would reveal the judgment or that the debtor did not in fact appeal the judgment. Kennedy v. Graybar Elec. Co. (In re Kennedy), - B.R. - (Bankr. D. Vt. July 29, 2011).

       <p>
        Key to proper notice, in the context of a name index, is the proper spelling of the debtor's name and the resulting proper alphabetical placement. Applying idem sonans to a name index would defeat the purpose of the index; therefore, when a judgment misspelled the debtor's last name, causing the recorded judgment to be indexed under the wrong spelling and to be missed during an index search, the doctrine of idem sonans did not allow enforcement of a judgment lien.

        It was sufficient, in order to render a person chargeable as trustee, that property have been deposited with him by principal debtor, or that he be indebted to principal debtor, though something farther - as, for instance, a demand - be requisite, in order to give principal debtor a right of action against him therefor.

        While an obligation for future support may not be trusteeable debt, yet where obligor has failed to support, and arbitrators have awarded specified sum against him because of such failure, such award was debt subject to attachment by trustee process, and when in such case obligee has brought his petition to foreclose mortgage executed to secure his support, obligor could deduct amount for which he had been adjudged trustee.

        An obligation to maintain person through life was mere personal matter, and where consideration did not move from person to be supported, it could not be attached by trustee process. Briggs v. Beach, 18 Vt. 115 (1846).

        Person could not be held as trustee for money received by him from principal debtor as usurious interest, since it was not "credit intrusted" to lender by borrower, within meaning of statute; but remedy for money so paid was rather statutory redress for virtual wrong, and, as such, part of administration of criminal law of country.

       <p>
        No particular form or ceremony is prescribed or necessary, to constitute sufficient notice, but it must be such knowledge or information, communicated by assignee of debt, or by his procurement, to alleged trustee, as gives him fully to understand that such assignee is the owner of demand. Dale v. Kimpton, 46 Vt. 76 (1873).
       </p>
       <p>
        Communication by which such knowledge or information is imported, may be merely casual, and for no definite purpose, and yet be sufficient notice. Dale v. Kimpton, 46 Vt. 76 (1873).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not essential to validity of notice that it should be personally given by assignee, or his agent directly employed by him for that purpose, and if given by procurement of such agent, it is sufficient. Barron v. Porter, 44 Vt. 587 (1872).

       <p>
        Notice to maker of promissory note that it has been transferred, if sufficient to prevent his paying it to original payee, would suffice to prevent him from being held as payee's trustee. Downer v. Marsh, 28 Vt. 558 (1856).

       <p>
        Provision exempting from attachment negotiable paper, actually assigned, negotiated, and transferred to bank before due, has been construed to afford such exemption only to extent necessary for protection of bank holding paper. Shurtleff v. Norcross, 95 Vt. 420, 115 A. 494 (1921).
       </p>
       <p>
        Negotiable paper transferred to a bank as collateral security was exempt from attachment by trustee process only so far as necessary for security of bank. Sargent v. Wood, 51 Vt. 597 (1879).
       </p>
       <p>
        Negotiable paper transferred to bank before maturity was exempt from attachment by trustee process although judgment was obtained against trustee before such transfer. Bank of Newbury v. Webster, 47 Vt. 43 (1874).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact of such transfer before negotiable paper became due had effect to exempt paper from process, and in this respect it made no difference whether previous to such transfer process had been served that would hold debt if paper had not been transferred to bank, where bank discounted paper in good faith in ordinary course of business without knowledge of pendency of trustee process.

     <p>
      A person shall not be summoned as a trustee, unless at the time of the service of the writ he or she resides in the State. However, debts due and owing from a person resident outside the State, or from a number of persons, part or all of whom reside outside the State, having an authorized agent resident in the State, may be attached and holden by trustee process. Service of such process upon such agent as provided for in service of writs of summons, shall be sufficient notice to such trustees as reside outside the State.

        Under this section and sections 3013 and 3018 of this title, the debt reached must be one actually owed the judgment debtor by the third party at the time of service of the trustee process, or one which comes into the third party's hands before he files his disclosure in the trustee process proceeding, the exception to this rule being when the third party fails to fulfill his responsibilities under the law and therefore puts his own resources at stake for the benefit of the judgment creditor.

        Debt which is certain as to liability, and uncertain only as to amount, is not contingent, within meaning of statute, but may be taken by trustee process. Rowell v. Felker, 54 Vt. 526 (1881); Joslyn & Hatch v. Merrow, 25 Vt. 185 (1853); Downer v. Topliff, 19 Vt. 399 (1847).

      Except as herein otherwise provided, a person shall not be liable on trustee process on account of a sum due or owing to the principal debtor for property sold or conveyed or delivered by him or her, which was exempt from attachment and execution at the time of the sale.
    If at the time the trustee process was commenced, the principal debtor was the owner of other property exempt from attachment and execution and of the same kind as that sold by him or her to the trustee, so far as such other property was free from encumbrance for the purchase money, the provisions of this section shall not apply.

        This section was first enacted in 1865, and while prior thereto for many years specific articles of property had been exempt from attachment and sale on mesne process, or execution, it had been repeatedly held that debt created by sale of such exempt articles was subject to attachment by trustee process.

        Exemption in case of homestead was in no way dependent upon debtor's continuing to be housekeeper, nor upon his intention to acquire another homestead, nor upon intent with which he keeps proceeds. Locke v. Post, 71 Vt. 343, 45 A. 226 (1899).

        Where defendant owned two lots of land, one containing an acre and a half with house on it kept for his home, worth $450, and the other lot, forty rods distant, kept and occupied as part of homestead, worth $650, and sold both, $500 was exempt, as homestead included not only house and lot on which it stood, but $50 in value in other lot.

If the plaintiff examines the alleged trustee thereon, he or she shall propose interrogatories in writing, which shall be answered in writing, signed by the trustee, and sworn to by him or her in open court or before a person authorized by law to administer oaths.

      A commissioner may summon the trustee to appear before him or her and make disclosure; and if, after reasonable notice from the commissioner, he or she does not appear, or, appearing, does not make disclosure, the commissioner shall report the fact to the court.
    Thereupon, unless cause is shown to the contrary, the court shall render judgment as in case of default against the trustee.
    When the trustee appears before the commissioner and does not answer the interrogatories proposed by the plaintiff or commissioner, such failure to answer, relative to the particular matter to which such answer is required, shall be taken against him or her.

        Where one summoned as trustee had, previous to service of trustee process on him, signed promissory note as cosurety with principal defendant, and he paid note after trustee process was served upon him, he was entitled to deduct from funds in his hands one-half of amount so paid - being amount for which he was entitled to call principal defendant for contribution as cosurety.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Trustee could retain not only such demands against defendant as were due, but also such as were to fall due, and thus he could retain, of sum to be paid on defendant's promissory note which was not yet due, enough to pay his own note due presently. Lynde v. Watson, 52 Vt. 648 (1880).

       </h5>
       <p>
        One who was chargeable by trustee process could not deduct amount of note which he had merely endorsed for principal debtor but had not paid nor assumed. Husted v. Stone, 69 Vt. 149, 37 A. 253 (1896).
       </p>
       <p>
        Right of trustee to retain claims in his favor, out of effects in his hands, extends only to existing demands founded on contract, and not to matters on which trustee stands simply as surety, unless he has absolutely assumed their payment. M. Noyes & Co. v. Hickok, 27 Vt. 36 (1854).

       <p>
        Where trustees who were agents of defendant, orally guaranteed to policy holders payment of unearned premiums on their policies in case of cancellation by defendant, and received from defendant commission in view of such guaranties, guaranties were unenforceable, as within statute of frauds, and trustees were not entitled to deduct from funds of defendant in their hands amounts paid by them thereunder.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Independent claims in favor of trustee against principal debtor were within statute and had no reference to time of service of process, unless they arose from voluntary advances made by trustee to principal debtor after service of process, or from other transactions, intended to render the creditor's attachment less beneficial to him; and when such independent claims are set up by trustee, and there is no proof of fraud, but will allow him to retain for such claims from amount in his hands.

        Where several trustees, summoned under trustee statute, disclosed a joint indebtedness to principal debtor, and one of trustees claimed that principal debtor was indebted to himself and third person, as partners, such individual trustee would not be allowed to set off this claim against joint indebtedness of himself and his cotrustees.

       <p>
        Where it appeared that trustee employed defendant through an interpreter who gave defendant's name as Arthur Goulette, and that name was entered on trustee's books some weeks before writ was served, and defendant's time credited to that name for two days, but the same work was also credited under the name of Charles Goulette, and all defendant's work after the first two days was credited to that name, and that after the writ was served on trustee, defendant applied for his wages, presenting time slip made out in name of Charles Goulette and received wages due on that account, it was held that while there may be circumstances in which ignorance of defendant's ownership of fund will entitle trustee to the same protection as ignorance of the service of the writ, under this section, yet service of process in name under which defendant was originally entered on books three weeks prior thereto was sufficient to put the trustee on inquiry regarding change in name of account, and hence it was in fault in crediting defendant's earnings under another name, and could not take advantage of this section.

        Plaintiff who obtained summary judgment against husband and moved for trustee process to satisfy the judgment with bank account held by husband and wife in the name "Rita Larose or Albert Larose" could not successfully claim that as wife was not a party husband could not claim the account could not be used to satisfy the debt because of wife's interest in the account, on the ground that a principle of standing is that one party ordinarily cannot assert the rights of another, as husband had an interest in protecting what might prove to be property held by the entirety, and wife's interest was so great, in view of fact she deposited the funds after her father left them to her upon his death and husband's name was not originally on the account, that fundamental fairness required that wife be officially made a party.

        Plaintiff who obtained summary judgment against husband and moved for trustee process to satisfy the judgment with bank account held by husband and wife in the name "Rita Larose or Albert Larose" could not successfully claim that as wife was not a party husband could not claim the account could not be used to satisfy the debt because of wife's interest in the account, on the ground that a principle of standing is that one party ordinarily cannot assert the rights of another, as husband had an interest in protecting what might prove to be property held by the entirety, and wife's interest was so great, in view of fact she deposited the funds after her father left them to her upon his death and husband's name was not originally on the account, that fundamental fairness required that wife be officially made a party.

       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to show right or title in claimant. Stevens v. Fullington, 59 Vt. 671, 10 A. 829 (1887); Davis v. Willey, 57 Vt. 125 (1884); Crawford v. Gould, 52 Vt. 409 (1880); Way, Titus & Co. v. Pierce, 51 Vt. 326 (1878).
       </p>
       <p>
        To entitle claimant to funds in hands of trustee, he must show present legal right thereto; it was not sufficient to show valid claim or right of action against the defendant. Sibley v. Johnson, 43 Vt. 67 (1870).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where it appeared that by arrangement between principal defendant, trustee, and claimant, made for purpose of protecting former's property from attachment by his creditors, claimant held himself out as owner of defendant's property, and executed fictitious bill of sale thereof to trustee, and delivered property to him and took his note therefor, transaction, though void as to bona fide creditors of defendant, was valid as to parties to it, and therefore it was competent for claimant to show before commissioner that plaintiff was not bona fide creditor of defendant, but was merely prosecuting suit for latter's benefit.

Fisher v. Williams, 56 Vt. 586 (1884).
       </p>
       <p>
        Judgment in favor of claimant did not determine what, if anything, was due claimant from trustee; but when judgment was rendered trustee was discharged, and claimant was left to pursue his remedy against him the same as though no trustee suit had ever been brought, and trustee had same right to defend.

     <p>
      When personal property is taken upon a writ of attachment or execution, the officer serving such process may lodge a copy of the same, with his or her return, in the office or offices proper for the filing of a financing statement to perfect a security interest in such property under 9A V.S.A. ยง 9-401. Such lodgment shall hold the property against all subsequent sales, attachments, or executions as if it had been actually removed and taken into the possession of the officer, and different officers thereafter may serve in like manner other writs of attachment or execution so as to create a valid subordinate lien upon the same property.
    Where such process is required by this section to be lodged in any office other than that of the town clerk in the town where the property is found, it shall be sufficient if the officer sends a copy of the process by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested, to the appropriate office.

       <p>
        Return of service which did not contain or have appended to it a list or description of the goods or estate attached, but simply indicated service by delivery of the writ of attachment to the town clerk, was defective, and the attempt to attach was wholly inoperative and created no valid lien. Rodrigue v. Biron, 147 Vt. 90, 510 A.2d 1321 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        When property is attached by leaving a copy of the writ in the town clerk's office, the want of a return, or a defective return, upon the copy so left, was held to render attachment ineffectual because return is all that constitutes the attachment, and without the return it is impossible to determine what property was intended to be attached. McKenzie v. Ransom, 22 Vt. 324 (1850).

        Sale of property upon chattel mortgage was not a conversion as against an officer who had attached same by copy in town clerk's office, where no possession was taken of property sold. Thorp v. Robbins, 68 Vt. 53, 33 A. 896 (1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        Officer could maintain trespass against another officer who, subsequent to leaving copy in town clerk's office and before copy was delivered to debtor, attached and removed the same property by virtue of a legal writ of attachment against same debtor. Putnam v. Clark, 17 Vt. 82 (1843).
       </p>
       <p>
        Attachment of hay and grain by leaving copies agreeable to this section enabled the officer to maintain trespass against one who took or used the same. Stanton v. Hodges, 6 Vt. 64 (1834); Putnam v. Clark, 17 Vt. 82 (1843); McKormsby v. Morris, 29 Vt. 417 (1857).
       </p>
       <p>
        An attachment made pursuant to this section gave sufficient title to officer to enable him to maintain trover, although he did not take actual possession. Lowry v. Walker, 5 Vt. 181 (1833), same case 4 Vt. 76.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where an attachment is made by filing, pursuant to this section, the property attached must be described with reasonable certainty in the return or in an inventory annexed thereto, and must be sufficiently identified to inform the defendant and those with whom he may deal that the property is attached. Rodrigue v. Biron, 147 Vt. 90, 510 A.2d 1321 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Description of property sought to be attached as "six cows, five of said cows are the same bought of Byron Davis, of Greensboro, and one bought of McClary, of Greensboro," created no lien in favor of the officer. Keniston v. Stevens, 66 Vt. 351, 29 A. 312 (1894).
       </p>
       <p>
        Description "100 fleeces of wool, 100 sheep, two cows, 75 tons of hay, 450 tin sap buckets, one evaporator, one ox cart, one mowing machine, horse rake, one single sleigh, one buggy wagon, one Prescott organ, 40 bobbin logs, situated on defendant's farm," was sufficient, and the same would be true if the word "situated" were omitted. Barron v. Smith, 63 Vt. 121, 21 A. 269 (1890).
       </p>
       <p>
        Return on the copy left with town clerk must contain a specific description of the property attached. Pond v. Baker, 55 Vt. 400 (1883), same case 58 Vt. 293, 2 A. 164, 93 A.L.R. 763.
       </p>
       <p>
        Officer was not bound to give a description of each cow so particular that a subsequent attaching creditor could not err in determining which he had attached. Brooks v. Farr, 51 Vt. 396 (1878).
       </p>
       <p>
        It has been repeatedly held in this State that an attempt to attach personal property by leaving a copy of the writ in the town clerk's office, with a return thereon describing the property as being all the property of its kind in the town, and nothing more, is wholly inoperative and creates no lien. West River Bank v. Gorham, 38 Vt. 649 (1866); Rogers v. Fairfield, 36 Vt. 641 (1864); Paul v. Burton, 32 Vt. 148 (1859).
       </p>
       <p>
        All that is necessary to create a valid lien is that return of officer should be sufficiently precise to show identity of property attached. Fullam v. Stearns, 30 Vt. 443 (1857).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statement in return that property was attached as belonging to both defendants, when in fact one of them had no interest in it, was no part of its description, and such attachment was valid to hold all interest of either of defendants in property. Fullman v. Stearns, 30 Vt. 443 (1857).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to give an officer the constructive possession of personal property attached by leaving a copy with the town clerk, it was only necessary that property should be described with reasonable certainty; and sufficiency of return in this respect was to be determined by applying it to actual state of debtor's property at the time. Bucklin v. Crampton, 20 Vt. 261 (1848).

       <p>
        Proper evidence of an attachment was officer's return on original writ, and until that was proved to have been lost, a copy was not admissible. Weeks v. Sowles, 58 Vt. 696, 6 A. 603 (1886).
       </p>
       <p>
        Officer's affidavit and certified copy of record of writ and return left in town clerk's office were admissible as evidence. Pond v. Campbell, 56 Vt. 674 (1884).
       </p>
       <p>
        Return of a sheriff, on a writ, is evidence in his behalf of the official acts therein contained. Stanton v. Hodges, 6 Vt. 64 (1834).

       <p>
        Where defendant was described in writ of summons and attachment as a corporation without designating the state of its incorporation, and service was made by attaching defendant's property and lodging copy of writ in town clerk's office pursuant to section 3251 of this title, and by delivery of copy to one described as defendant's agent "for want of a designated service of process agent within this state", the defect in description of defendant might be cured by amendment, and, since the jurisdiction of the property acquired by the attachment afforded a basis for retaining the suit, service might thereafter be perfected as required by statute. Kittredge v. The Fairbanks Company, 91 Vt. 174, 99 A. 1016 (1916).

        Purchaser of personal property at execution sale subject to two mortgages could not repudiate either, since terms of sale, although not creating direct liability on purchaser to pay debt of either mortgage, created condition which purchaser must perform to perfect its title to property.

        Purchaser of personal property at execution sale subject to two mortgages and paying one of said mortgages and taking assignment thereof, was estopped to deny validity of other mortgage, since it would be inequitable to permit purchaser to secure property at lower figure than any other interested party believed or intended at time of such sale.

       <p>
        Attaching creditor must pay or tender to the vendor, his agent or attorney, amount unpaid within ten days from time he has notice thereof, though the ten days expires before unpaid purchase money becomes due by contract of sale. Fales v. Roberts, 38 Vt. 503 (1866).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that there was a dispute as to amount due did not interfere with right of attaching creditor to make tender. Fales v. Roberts, 38 Vt. 503 (1866), distinguished in Rowan v. Union Arms Co. (1863) 36 Vt. 124.
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was a dispute as to how much of purchase money, if any, was unpaid, so that it was necessary for an accounting to be made to determine what was due, it could not be urged as a bar to accounting that attaching creditor did not pay or tender to vendors residue of purchase money remaining unpaid within ten days after attachment. Rowan v. Union Arms Co., 36 Vt. 124 (1863).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where one has purchased personal property with an agreement that it shall belong to vendor until price is paid, in order to enable a creditor of vendee to attach and hold property discharged from claim of vendor, he must pay or tender to vendor amount of his claim to property within ten days after the attachment, and this tender must be of a definite sum and money must be brought into court; tender must be so made that vendor may accept sum offered at any point in proceeding, and that he may also have it secured to him in the event of litigation being determined against him.

        After default of payment or tender, an officer who held property taken by him on attachment or who sold it at execution sale was a trespasser and was liable for his unlawful taking. Commercial Credit Corp. v. Dusckett, 114 Vt. 450, 49 A.2d 106 (1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section where a conditional sales agreement was seasonably recorded, an attaching creditor had no right to hold property as against vendor otherwise than by payment or tender of amount due; he must have complied with provisions of statute if he was to benefit from his attachment. Commercial Credit Corp. v. Dusckett, 114 Vt. 450, 49 A.2d 106 (1946).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where conditionally sold property was attached by officer and later stolen from him, officer was liable to vendor for full value of the property, not merely amount due, where no tender was made to vendor. Duncans v. Stone, 45 Vt. 118 (1872).

        Resort to proceedings for examination, appraisal, and sale of attached property was warranted only by specific statutory law, and to be justified proceedings must be shown to have been in conformity with provisions of such law.

       <p>
        Although this section does not provide when notice shall be given of application to have attached property examined, appraised and sold, except that it shall be at least 20 days prior to sale of property, it must be given a reasonable length of time before appraisers act, so that parties may have an opportunity to be present if they so desire. Arthur A. Bishop & Co. v. Thompson, 99 Vt. 17, 130 A. 701 (1924).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where notice of examination, appraisal, and sale of attached property was not given debtor until after appraisers had been appointed and appraised property, there was an unqualified noncompliance with statute in a respect essential to authority of officer to sell attached property, in absence of consent of parties, and by reason thereof sale by officer constituted conversion of such property. Arthur A. Bishop & Co. v. Thompson, 99 Vt. 17, 130 A. 701 (1924).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff's property was attached and, at the request of the attaching creditor, sold under the provisions of this section, but officer did not give plaintiff written notice of the application, sale was illegal although the plaintiff had verbal notice and was present at the appraisal and sale, and did not object. Walker v. Wilmarth, 37 Vt. 289 (1864).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not necessary in order to authorize officer to proceed to sell property that he should also notify owner of property that property had been appraised and at what amount. Abbott v. Kimball, 23 Vt. 542 (1851), same case 19 Vt. 551.

        An accused person is bailable as a matter of right unless charged with a capital offense when the proof of guilt is evident or presumption great. State v. Toomey, 126 Vt. 123, 223 A.2d 473 (1966).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Among the factors to be taken into account by a court in determining the amount of bail are ability of the accused to furnish bail, nature of the offense, penalty for the offense charged, character and reputation of the accused, health of the accused, character and strength of the evidence, probability of the accused appearing at trial, and whether the accused was a fugitive from justice when arrested. State v. Toomey, 126 Vt. 123, 223 A.2d 473 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that a respondent was not a "local person" is a factor which may be considered by the trial court under certain circumstances in setting sufficient bail to ensure the respondent's appearance. State v. Toomey, 126 Vt. 123, 223 A.2d 473 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that victim of the alleged offense was a "local person," while respondent was not, is not, of itself, a tenable reason upon which the trial court could exercise its discretion in setting bail. State v. Toomey, 126 Vt. 123, 223 A.2d 473 (1966).

     <p>
      When it appears that the security or recognizance for the prosecution of a pending cause or an appeal or the bail taken by the officer on the writ, is insufficient to secure the party for whose benefit the same was taken, the court, or the clerk in vacation, in his or her discretion, may order sufficient bail to be entered by a certain time, or that judgment be rendered against the party neglecting to comply with such order.
    Within the time provided, the party so required to furnish bail shall file with the clerk of the court a bond with sufficient surety in the amount required, to be approved by the clerk, or shall with sufficient surety, so approved, enter into a personal recognizance before the clerk in such amount.
    Such recognizance shall be entered by the clerk upon the docket of the cause.

      When a surety recognizes before a Superior judge, for the appearance before the Superior Court of a person charged with being the father of a bastard child, the officer making the arrest upon the warrant shall deliver to such surety a bailpiece, if required, provided the recognizance is entered into before a Superior judge.
    If such recognizance is entered into before a judge of the Superior Court, the keeper of the jail in the county in which the principal is confined shall, if required, deliver to such surety a bailpiece.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        An unfulfilled promise to furnish a tractor and plow will support a tort action if such promise is part of a general scheme to defraud. Jobidon v. Lussier, 124 Vt. 242, 204 A.2d 88 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        If complaint was actually in contract but writ issued as a capias with arrest of defendant thereon, court would be without jurisdiction of the process. New England Acceptance Corp. v. Nichols, 110 Vt. 478, 8 A.2d 665 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where complaint contains some counts sounding in contract and other counts sounding in tort, writ issued as a capias is void on its face, court is without jurisdiction, and the infirmity cannot be corrected by amendment or otherwise. Howard v. Chapman, 101 Vt. 152, 141 A. 686 (1928); Parker v. Roberts, 99 Vt. 219, 131 A. 21 (1925); Roy v. Phelps, 83 Vt. 174, 75 A. 13 (1909).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where complaint on false warranty in sale of goods did not allege knowledge of falsity of defendant, action was founded on contract instead of tort and arrest of defendant was not authorized. Roy v. Phelps, 83 Vt. 174, 75 A. 13 (1909); Caldbeck v. Simanton, 82 Vt. 69, 71 A. 881 (1908).

       <p>
        Liability incurred by one who becomes bail for defendant on mesne process, is a liability upon contract, and execution issued against body of such bail, upon judgment against him on scire facias, will be set aside. Stoughton v. Barrett, 20 Vt. 385 (1848).

        Probate court had no power to imprison executor until he complied with order for payment of money, since this would be imprisonment for a judgment debt. In re Leach, 51 Vt. 630 (1879).
       </p>
       <p>
        A judgment is a contract, and an execution, obtained in an action of debt upon a judgment, cannot legally issue against body of debtor. Sawyer v. Vilas, 19 Vt. 43 (1846).

        Although at common law when an officer arrested a man on mesne process in a civil action, he might make any place his prison, for the command of the writ gave him a general authority in this respect, yet this section has changed the common law in respect of this general authority and makes the authority special in such cases, notwithstanding the command of the writ remains the same.

       <p>
        Execution commanding officer, for want of sufficient goods and chattels of the debtor, to take his body and commit him to the keeper of the jail in the county, "or such other jail as the law directs," sufficiently complied with the statutory form of
        ยง
        5908 of this title and justified commitment of debtor to jail in an adjoining county, when jail in county where the arrest was made had been destroyed by fire. In re Hunt, 85 Vt. 345, 82 A. 178 (1911).
       </p>
       <p>
        When there was no legal jail in county, there was no error in mittimus directing commitment to jail in adjoining county. State v. Malloy, 54 Vt. 96 (1881).
       </p>
       <p>
        In action of trespass for false imprisonment, officer cannot justify under execution regular upon its face, where he commits debtor in different county from the one in which arrest is made, when there is a legal jail in the latter county, although commitment is made in county commanded in execution.

        Under this section, commitment to jail consists of delivery of the person to keeper of jail within the same, and delivery to jailer of attested copy of writ by virtue of which commitment was made, with officer's return of commitment. Kenerson v. Bacon, 41 Vt. 573 (1869).

        Neglect of officer to leave copy of mittimus and return with jailer does not invalidate commitment. State v. Malloy, 54 Vt. 96 (1881).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where officer, upon committing the respondent, left copy of mittimus with jailer, and it appeared upon face of copy that signature of officer was intended to authenticate the paper, as a copy of the precept and return, such a mere informality did not render commitment and detention illegal. Ex parte Tracy, 25 Vt. 93 (1853).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where debtor was committed to jail upon mesne process, and copy left by committing officer with jailer showed that the original process was a writ of summons, jailer was not liable for an escape for permitting debtor to go at large, since he was not bound to look beyond his copy of the process.

        Provision that persons privileged from arrest who shall make it known to the officer may plead it in abatement is intended for those only who are exempted from arrest on peculiar grounds, as parties, witnesses, members of the legislature, etc., and has no application to case of a person not so exempted, who is arrested in consequence of the filing of an affidavit that he is about to abscond, or remove.

        Although a sheriff may not, as indulgence or privilege, relax strictness of close jail confinement, he is not to be held conclusively liable for an escape upon proof that he has taken or allowed prisoner to be out of jail in custody of himself or his deputy; if the absence is temporary and for justifiable and good cause, and control of sheriff is at all times maintained, either personally or through agency of a deputy, there is no escape.

      When the petition is granted, after the time fixed by the court or justice, the prisoner may apply to the commissioners of jail delivery in the county for a discharge from imprisonment.
    After giving notice to the opposite party before such examination, as provided in other cases in this chapter, if they find on examination that such person has not property, except his or her wearing apparel, exceeding $20.00, the commissioners shall administer to him or her the following oath:
     </p>
     <p>
      "You solemnly swear that you have not estate, real or personal, exceeding $20.00, except your wearing apparel, and that you have not disposed of any of your property for the purpose of defrauding the complainant in the proceedings on which you are committed.
    So help you God."

      Upon taking such oath, the prisoner shall be discharged as other persons are discharged upon taking the poor debtor's oath, and shall thereafter be free from arrest or imprisonment upon an execution issued upon any judgment rendered in such bastardy proceedings or founded thereon.
    The judgment shall remain in force, and the plaintiff may have execution against his or her property for nonpayment of orders of court, or may sustain an action of contract thereon.

        Where, by consent to a judgment, an appeal is waived, the writ of habeas corpus ought not to give a review since it has been voluntarily foregone, or should it give more rights under a plea of guilty than are available under the writ after a full-dress trial and appellate review.

        It is not purpose of habeas corpus proceeding to determine guilt or innocence of a respondent, nor to pass upon errors in his trial, and unless there was no jurisdiction in court, judgment is not void and he cannot attack it collaterally by habeas corpus. In re Moses, 122 Vt. 36, 163 A.2d 868 (1960), overruled on other grounds, In re Dobson (1965) 125 Vt. 165, 212 A.2d 620.

        A writ of habeas corpus will be withstood if court whose action is assailed has jurisdiction of subject matter and person, and renders such judgment or makes such an order as it is authorized to render or make.

       <p>
        A writ of habeas corpus cannot be given the effect of a writ for the correction of errors and irregularities; proceedings under review, however irregular they may have been, will withstand the writ if the court whose action is assailed has jurisdiction of the subject matter and the person, and renders such a judgment or makes such an order as it is authorized to render or make in that class of cases. In re Greenough, 116 Vt. 277, 75 A.2d 569 (1950); In re Parker, 107 Vt. 463, 181 A. 106 (1935); In re Thompson, 111 Vt. 7, 9 A.2d 107 (1939); In re Hook, 95 Vt. 497, 115 A. 730 (1921); Ex parte Kellogg, 6 Vt. 509 (1834).
       </p>

        Writ of habeas corpus challenged only jurisdiction of court imposing judgment, but inquiry was not confined to jurisdiction over subject matter and person involved, but extended to jurisdiction to render particular judgment in question. In re Parker, 107 Vt. 463, 181 A. 106 (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        While writ was not in nature of and could not be used as substitute for bill of exceptions or writ of error, it afforded appropriate means of attacking jurisdiction of court, not only over person or subject matter, but its jurisdiction to make very order or render particular judgment called in question. In re Dewar, 102 Vt. 340, 148 A. 489 (1929).

        A person will not be released because of a defective mittimus, but will be remanded that a new one may issue. In re Rogers, 75 Vt. 329, 55 A. 661 (1903).
       </p>
       <p>
        Habeas corpus does not lie for the mere correction of error and in general one confined upon sentence following conviction will not be released upon that writ unless sentence is void. In re Fitton, 68 Vt. 297, 35 A. 319 (1896).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mere matter of error or that which would be a good ground for a new trial is not sufficient for discharging a respondent on habeas corpus. In re Dougherty, 27 Vt. 325 (1855).
       </p>
       <p>
        To justify discharge on habeas corpus for any irregularity accruing before judgment, it should ordinarily be of a character to render the judgment void. Ex parte Tracy, 25 Vt. 93 (1853).

        The lawfulness of arrest and detention in this state is unaffected by the character of the means employed to bring the relator within the reach of process of this state. In re Miles, 52 Vt. 609 (1875).

       <p>
        A writ of habeas corpus will not issue for release of prisoner from incarceration for convictions of perjury and arson where maximum sentence has been served but where prisoner is presently retained on mittimus for his conviction of another felony. In re Robinson, 125 Vt. 343, 215 A.2d 525 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        In case of a criminal complaint, writ of habeas corpus was available only to test whether crime was charged, and not whether it was defectively charged. In re Hook, 95 Vt. 497, 115 A. 730 (1921).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where habeas corpus issued on complaint that the relator was unlawfully imprisoned after conviction of a crime the question was not whether the complaint on which he was convicted was sufficient as a matter of pleading, but whether it was void in that it described no offense of which the court had jurisdiction. In re Turner, 92 Vt. 210, 102 A. 943 (1917).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where sentence and detention under it were void, prisoner was released on habeas corpus. In re Harris, 68 Vt. 243, 35 A. 55 (1896).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a person was fined at same time for more than one offense upon different prosecutions, and was committed on a mittimus covering sentences in all the cases, he will be discharged on habeas corpus, unless the mittimus recites each sentence so fully and clearly as to show what it was.

        Superior Court has jurisdictions to review prison disciplinary measures under habeas corpus statute. Shuttle v. Patrissi, 158 Vt. 127, 605 A.2d 845 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where administrative review under procedural rule is unavailable and there is no evidence of a deliberate relinquishment of rights under the rule, habeas corpus review provides an alternative means of protecting liberty interests of an inmate whose incarceration is prolonged as a result of prison disciplinary measures. Shuttle v. Patrissi, 158 Vt. 127, 605 A.2d 845 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Superior Court properly exercised habeas corpus jurisdiction despite inmate defendant's failure to properly pursue administrative review under procedural rule, where court looked at substance of appeal, not label, in changing action into habeas petition, record showed no strategy to deliberately delay filing under rule to gain advantage, defendant did not benefit from failure to properly invoke rule, and application of habeas statute was appropriate considering minimal due process safeguards found in prison disciplinary system. Shuttle v. Patrissi, 158 Vt. 127, 605 A.2d 845 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court reviewing habeas petition properly ordered that defendant's conviction for violating corrections rule be expunged, since defendant's conduct, using alcohol while on furlough, did not fall within proscription of rule. Shuttle v. Patrissi, 158 Vt. 127, 605 A.2d 845 (1992).

       </p>
       <p>
        When imprisonment of relator was justified solely by virtue of certified execution issued on judgment against him, burden was on judgment creditor to show on habeas corpus that said judgment was a liability of class not affected by discharge in bankruptcy which was granted relator under United States bankruptcy act.

       <p>
        Where one arrested in an action on contract appeared before authority signing writ and submitted himself to examination upon question whether he was about to abscond or remove from this State, such authority was not obliged to decide that question immediately, but could continue examination to a convenient time at his discretion; and during such continuance officer could commit defendant to county jail upon the process. In re Foote, 31 Vt. 505 (1859).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant, committed to jail in an action founded on contract under process issued by a justice of the peace upon affidavit of creditor, was not entitled to discharge upon a habeas corpus proceeding because justice failed to examine him as to grounds for the commitment, when he offered himself for such examination. In re Hosley, 22 Vt. 363 (1850).

        When an imprisoned debtor based his claim for discharge upon certain papers or documents prescribed by statute and not upon matter in pais upon which an issue to the jury might be expected to arise, he could enforce his right by writ of habeas corpus. Ex parte Davis, 18 Vt. 401 (1846).

        If juvenile prisoner was transferred to State's prison on basis of provision in this section for transfer for evaluation, treatment and rehabilitation, there was nothing to show it, and thus lower court's dismissal of his petition of habeas corpus without calling for responsive pleading was error.

        To prevail on habeas corpus, the petitioner must establish a defect of a kind and magnitude sufficient to oust jurisdiction of the court of conviction. In re Mears, 124 Vt. 131, 198 A.2d 27 (1964).

        If party be taken and committed to prison on an execution made returnable within 120 days when by law it ought to have been made returnable in sixty days, after the expiration of sixty days from date of such execution, such commitment is irregular and prisoner will be discharged on habeas corpus.

        Whether to permit habeas corpus review when defendant fails to avail himself of alternative avenues of review requires balance of liberty interests of inmates against State's interest in maintaining integrity of judicial process. Shuttle v. Patrissi, 158 Vt. 127, 605 A.2d 845 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Writ of habeas corpus does not generally provide a substitute for appellate review. Shuttle v. Patrissi, 158 Vt. 127, 605 A.2d 845 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Habeas corpus review is unavailable where an inmate intentionally avoids administrative review under procedural rule, either entirely or relative to an individual issue, to gain habeas corpus review. Shuttle v. Patrissi, 158 Vt. 127, 605 A.2d 845 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where prisoner who sought release under this general habeas corpus statute should have proceeded under special form of habeas corpus denominated post-conviction relief, and all substantive requirements of post-conviction relief statute had been met, court would treat petition as properly brought, in interests of justice and consistent with the remedial intent of the post-conviction relief statute. Sherwin v. Hogan, 136 Vt. 606, 401 A.2d 895 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Before seeking habeas corpus, which lies in the county of imprisonment, one under a conviction must bring a petition for post-conviction relief before the court in which conviction was had, and before a judge other than the sentencing judge; but where, prior to a petition for post-conviction relief, prisoner brought habeas corpus petition, court would, in interests of justice and since the requisites for one existed, treat it as a petition for post-conviction relief. Berard v. Moeykens, 132 Vt. 597, 326 A.2d 166 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Minor prisoner's challenge to his mother's mental competency to represent him at trial as guardian ad litem and enter guilty plea to second degree murder was a collateral attack on prisoner's sentence, and remedy was post-conviction relief under 13 V.S.A.

        A writ of habeas corpus is not a substitute for an appeal. In re Dobson, 125 Vt. 165, 212 A.2d 620 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        Writ of habeas corpus does not replace regular proceeding in error, but lies to question committing court's jurisdiction of person and subject matter, or its authority to render the kind of judgment or order it made. In re Dobson, 125 Vt. 165, 212 A.2d 620 (1965).

        Habeas corpus is not the remedy if a plea of guilty is unfairly obtained through ignorance, fear or misunderstanding. In re Garceau, 125 Vt. 185, 212 A.2d 633 (1965).

        In a habeas corpus hearing rights of relator are not dependent upon officer's return; but under this section he may deny return, and allege other material facts; thus, where return showed that justice found that relator "had been intoxicated, and had disturbed the public peace," Supreme Court could find from facts alleged in relator's complaint that he was not intoxicated. In re Hardigan, 57 Vt. 100 (1884).
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon habeas corpus, relator may controvert return of cause of his detention, and also prove any other facts deemed material to determination of case; but the court will not re-examine the proceedings of magistrate. In re Powers, 25 Vt. 261 (1853).

        This chapter does not authorize the issuance of process designed for the purpose of recapturing a person who has been unconditionally released and discharged by a writ of habeas corpus. In re Fitts, 124 Vt. 146, 197 A.2d 808 (1963).

      Nothing in this chapter shall prevent a court from issuing a writ of habeas corpus, when necessary, to bring before it a prisoner for trial in a criminal cause pending in the court, or to be surrendered in discharge of bail, or examined as a witness in any action or proceeding, civil or criminal, pending in such court, when the personal attendance and examination of the witness is necessary in the administration of justice.

        Though proceeding of quo warranto is criminal in form, it is regarded as civil remedy, and pleadings are governed by rules applicable to pleadings in ordinary civil actions. State ex rel. Tenney v. Watson, 96 Vt. 131, 117 A. 663 (1922).

       <p>
        Proceedings for writ of quo warranto are addressed to discretion of court, and may be denied on the ground of public policy or in consideration of general justice, all circumstances being considered and question determined from standpoint of public interest. State ex rel. Tenney v. Watson, 96 Vt. 131, 117 A. 663 (1922); State v. McGeary, 69 Vt. 461, 38 A. 165 (1897); State v. Smith, 48 Vt. 266 (1876), same case 48 Vt. 14, 53 Harv. L. Rev. 316.
       </p>
       <p>
        Quo warranto is addressed to sound discretion of court, and it would be unbecoming for court to act on complaint of private relator, who stands as wrongdoer in respect of the very thing in issue. Pomeroy v. Kelton, 78 Vt. 230, 62 A. 56 (1905).

       <p>
        Allegations of the complaint must be sufficiently full and explicit to show that the complainant has a case to establish, and the plea of non usurpavit is sufficient to put complainant to his proof. State ex rel. Tenney v. Watson, 96 Vt. 131, 117 A. 663 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        Complaint seeking quo warranto should positively and with certainty allege facts warranting issue of writ, agreeably to rules of common-law pleading. State ex rel. Ballard v. Greene, 87 Vt. 94, 88 A. 515 (1913).
       </p>
       <p>
        When leave is granted to file information in nature of writ of quo warranto, it is duty of court to fix some time, ordinarily during same term, for respondents to appear and plead; and if they do not voluntarily do so, their appearance will be compelled by due process of law. State v. Smith, 48 Vt. 266 (1876), same case 48 Vt. 14, 53 Harv. L. Rev. 316.

        Where quo warranto proceedings were instituted and prosecuted by a private individual under the authority conferred by this section, the State was not an actual party to the proceedings, although the title of the case may have indicated otherwise, not being concerned with the outcome of the controversy, and the burden rested upon the complainant to establish his case. State ex rel. Venner v. Zanleoni, 97 Vt. 212, 122 A. 495 (1923).
       </p>
       <p>
        Neither under this section nor otherwise has a private citizen, having no different interest than the public at large, the right to prosecute an information in the nature of quo warranto to compel a person to show by what authority he is exercising a license to sell intoxicating liquors. Brown v. Alderman, 82 Vt. 529, 74 A. 230 (1909).

        Proceedings to try title to public office cannot be brought before term of office commences. State ex rel. Tenney v. Watson, 96 Vt. 131, 117 A. 663 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, on a complaint by a private relator for quo warranto to try title to an office, it appeared that intoxicating liquor was systematically furnished to voters at the election in the interest of the relator and through his connivance, the writ was denied on the ground of public policy. Pomeroy v. Kelton, 78 Vt. 230, 62 A. 56 (1905).
       </p>
       <p>
        The granting or withholding leave to file an information in the nature of quo warranto, at the instance of a private relator, to test the right to an office, rests in the sound discretion of the court, even though there be a substantial defect in the titles by which the office is held.

       <p>
        Ordinarily a complaint by the state's attorney, virtute officii, though on the relation of another, seeking quo warranto, is not bad because insufficiently pleading relator's title, for it is not necessary to allege his title at all as, under this section, he will be ousted if he is shown to be without title, though relator fails to establish his title.

         2. Nature of writ.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Prohibition is a prerogative writ known to the common law, is directed against unwarranted assumption of jurisdiction or excesses of it, is a remedy of exigency and, like all other prerogative writs, is to be used for the furtherance of justice and to secure order and regularity in judicial proceedings and to be issued only in cases of extreme necessity. In re Petition of Green Mt. Post No. 1, 116 Vt. 256, 73 A.2d 309 (1950), same case 117 Vt. 405, 94 A.2d 230; In re Petition of Keefe, 115 Vt. 289, 57 A.2d 657 (1948); Springfield v. Newton, 115 Vt. 39, 50 A.2d 605 (1946); Burlington v. Burlington Traction Co., 70 Vt. 491, 41 A. 514 (1898).
       </p>
       <p>
        Function of writ of prohibition is to prevent unlawful assumption of jurisdiction by tribunal contrary to common law or statutory provisions. In re Mattison & Bentley, 120 Vt. 459, 144 A.2d 778 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prohibition enforces same substantive law that is determinative in any judicial proceeding, and its function is to provide a means to discovery and correction of errors or irregularities in judicial proceedings which would otherwise go unreviewed because they are outside scope of regular appellate procedure. In re Petition of Raymo, 121 Vt. 246, 154 A.2d 487 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prohibition does not lie to prevent errors or irregularities in judicial proceedings, if matter is within jurisdiction of the tribunal; but its function is to prevent unlawful assumption of jurisdiction, either of entire subject matter or of something collateral or incidental thereto, contrary to common law or statutory provisions. In re Petition of Raymo, 121 Vt. 246, 154 A.2d 487 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        As a matter of discretion, writ of prohibition will issue in any event when petitionees are clearly without jurisdiction to act, and this is especially true where it is in the public interest to have a question settled as soon as possible. Reed v. Allen, 121 Vt. 202, 153 A.2d 74 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        Writ of prohibition is not proceeding between private litigants but is, in effect, proceeding between two courts, superior and inferior. Marchand v. Addison Probate Court, 123 Vt. 187, 186 A.2d 85 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        Writ of prohibition is directed against the unwarranted assumption of jurisdiction and is designed to secure order and regularity of judicial proceedings. Woodstock v. County Road Commissioners, 125 Vt. 510, 218 A.2d 691 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        The writ of prohibition, despite the breadth of relief suggested by its name, is an extraordinary writ of limited and specific application; its function is to control the use of judicial power and assure the regularity of its exercise. Hatley v. Lium, 126 Vt. 385, 231 A.2d 647 (1967).

Petition of Mattison and Bentley (1958) 120 Vt. 459, 144 A.2d 778; In re Petition of Green Mt. Post No. 1, 116 Vt. 256, 73 A.2d 309 (1950), same case 117 Vt. 405, 94 A.2d 230; Springfield v.

        Supreme Court will exercise its discretion to refuse to grant writ of prohibition where question involved is one of law, such as constitutionality of an act, which may be regularly brought before reviewing court an appeal. In re Petition of Green Mt Post No. 1, 116 Vt. 256, 73 A.2d 309 (1950), same case 117 Vt. 405, 94 A.2d 230.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is within discretion of Supreme Court to grant a writ of prohibition if available relief by appeal or writ of error is not adequate in sense that it is not plain, speedy and is not potentially productive of substantially same relief afforded by writ if granted, or if public interest requires a settling of question at earliest possible moment. In re Petition of Raymo, 121 Vt. 246, 154 A.2d 487 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prohibition proceedings do not pass upon exceptions saved at trial below in manner of an appeal, but rather, in appropriate cases, act as a means to extraordinary remedy where operation of usual appellate procedures are absent or do not give complete and adequate relief in particular circumstances. In re Petition of Raymo, 121 Vt. 246, 154 A.2d 487 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        As a prerogative or extraordinary writ, prohibition does not ordinarily lie for grievances which may be redressed in ordinary course of judicial proceedings by remedies provide, by law such as appeal, writ of error, writ of review, certiorari, motion for a change of venue, injunction or mandamus. In re Petition of Raymo, 121 Vt. 246, 154 A.2d 487 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to prohibition is defeated, not by existence, but by adequacy, of another remedy. Reed v. Allen, 121 Vt. 202, 153 A.2d 74 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        Writ of prohibition will not issue to correct errors of fact or law which are subject to review by right of appeal. Woodstock v. County Road Commissioners, 125 Vt. 510, 218 A.2d 691 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        Writ of prohibition is an extraordinary writ, an emergency power, to be invoked when regular judicial procedures are unable or unavailable to effectively resolve the issues sought to be raised and in the absence of a showing of the inadequacy of other relief plainly available, the Supreme Court will refrain from allowing this remedy to be used to interrupt the orderly course of trial procedure. Hatley v. Lium, 126 Vt. 385, 231 A.2d 647 (1967).

        A writ of prohibition is proper method to prevent illegal taking of deposition for use in criminal case. Reed v. Allen, 121 Vt. 202, 153 A.2d 74 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        Ordinarily, in a case where prohibition is not otherwise justified, usual expense of litigation to resolve bona fide legal issues will not by themselves support issuance of writ. In re Petition of Raymo, 121 Vt. 246, 154 A.2d 487 (1959).
       </p>
       <p>
        That matters in issue in action before justice of the peace are res judicata does not deprive justice of jurisdiction, so that prohibition will lie to restrain further proceedings under an erroneous judgment therein. Wilkins v. Stiles, 75 Vt. 42, 52 A. 1048 (1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        Party having single, indivisible cause of action cannot split it up into several suits, and if he does so for the purpose of giving justice of the peace final jurisdiction which he would not otherwise have, and defendant has no other remedy, a writ of prohibition will issue in the name of the state against the plaintiff, his attorney and the justice.

       </p>
       <p>
        Mandamus may properly issue where actions of public officers amount to an arbitrary denial of petitioner's rights. Rutland Cable T.V., Inc. v. Rutland, 122 Vt. 162, 166 A.2d 191 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        When public official refuses to perform duties enjoined upon him by law, and such refusal leaves complainant without remedy, writ of mandamus should issue. Carpenter's Adm'r v. Brown, 118 Vt. 148, 102 A.2d 331 (1953); Sanborn v. Weir, 95 Vt. 1, 112 A. 228 (1920).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although mandamus usually lies for enforcement of purely ministerial acts and will not lie to review performance of an official act in involving exercise of judgement or discretion, where there appears, in some form, an arbitrary abuse of power vested by law in an administrative officer or board which amounts to a virtual refusal to act or to perform a duty imposed by law, mandamus may be resorted to in absence of other adequate legal remedy. Couture v. Selectmen of Berkshire, 121 Vt. 359, 159 A.2d 78 (1960); Okemo Mtn. v. Town of Ludlow, 127 Vt. 354, 249 A.2d 401 (1969).

       </p>
       <p>
        To justify issuance of a writ a mandamus it must appear from the petition that petitioner has a clear legal right to the performance of the acts he seeks to have compelled and there must be a binding duty on the part of the officer to act in compliance with what is requested of him. Town of Pawlet v. Witherspoon, 128 Vt. 120, 259 A.2d 15 (1969).
       </p>

        Mandamus being an extraordinary writ which invokes a drastic remedy, it availability is restricted to situations where the enforcement of a clear and certain right is the objective and there is a binding duty of the official to act. Whiteman v. Brown, 128 Vt. 384, 264 A.2d 793 (1970).

        Resolution authorizing construction of a junior high school and providing for a bond issue for that purpose was duly passed over mayor's veto, the mayor's discretion in matter ended with his veto, and when authorized bonds were prepared and presented to him for signature, if legally issued, his duty to sign them was merely ministerial, and could be compelled by mandamus.

        Landowner was entitled to have mandamus issued directing local board of health to remove, or cause to be remove, the hazard to the public health caused by adjoining landowner's discharge of raw sewage into open gully on his property where board had arbitrarily abused its power to cause removal by failing to do so even though it and the state had recognized the condition as a public health hazard, and where to require petitioner to bring on and action to abate a public nuisance would not afford him a clear, speedy, convenient and adequate remedy.

         One tenant in common is bound to account to his cotenant under this section without any agreement to that effect, for one-half of the rent received from a lessee to whom the whole property was leased, and whose occupancy was exclusive, although the lessee did not use it to exceed one-half of its capacity.

         Act "relating to actions between copartners," approved November 15, 1852, referred only to such actions as were brought to settle and adjust partnership accounts, and to which the copartners alone were parties. Green v. Chapman, 27 Vt. 236 (1855).

         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         Action of account is proper remedy for adjustment of all controversies arising out of tenancy on shares, and everything growing out of such contract affecting proper settlement and division may be brought into such accounting. Doyle v. Polle, 121 Vt. 335, 157 A.2d 226 (1960); Smith v. Thibault, 122 Vt. 256, 168 A.2d 729 (1961).
        </p>
        <p>
         Action of account between owner of farm and tenants on shares was proper remedy under this section and section 4251 of this title for failure of tenants to leave certain grain according to agreement and for removal of cattle raised on farm and cattle purchased for benefit of tenancy. Mott v. Bourgeois, 109 Vt. 514, 1 A.2d 704 (1938).
        </p>
        <p>
         Action of account at common law cannot be maintained to settle partnership matters between three or more partners having separate and distinct interests. Stevens v. Coburn, 71 Vt. 261, 44 A. 354 (1899).
        </p>
        <p>
         Partner may sustain action of account against surviving partner and administrator of deceased partner. Park v. McGowen, 64 Vt. 173, 23 A. 855 (1891); Newell v. Humphrey, 37 Vt. 265 (1864).

          3. Jurisdiction.
         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         By this section and section 4258 of this title county courts are given original and exclusive jurisdiction of such action in courts of law, with all powers of court of chancery, and so probate court has no jurisdiction of action of account by way of proof of claim against decedent's estate, where more than two parties having separate and distinct interests are concerned, and consequently county court has none on appeal. Hodges's Adm'r v. Hodges's Est., 90 Vt. 214, 97 A. 676 (1916).
        </p>
        <p>
         Section does not extend jurisdiction to justice courts nor to city court of Montpelier. Stevens v. Coburn, 71 Vt. 261, 44 A. 354 (1899).
        </p>
        <p>
         The equitable powers conferred upon law courts in connection with action of account have reference to administration of suits where title of parties is legal; they do not confer jurisdiction where title is equitable. Leonard v. Leonard, 67 Vt. 318, 31 A. 783 (1895).
        </p>
        <p>
         County court, by force of this section, has all the power of court of chancery, in closing up partnership matters in an equitable manner. Foster v. Ives, 53 Vt. 458 (1881).
        </p>
        <p>
         Section does not extend jurisdiction of justices of the peace to accounts to be rendered between three or more parties. La Point v. Scott, 36 Vt. 633 (1864), same case 36 Vt. 603.

       <p>
        The word "shall", in former provision of this section that when injunction is dissolved by final decree in favor of enjoined party, that party may recover actual damages caused by wrongful issuance of the injunction, "which shall be ascertained by reference to a master", is synonymous with "may", as reference to a master is permissive rather than mandatory.

       <p>
        An allowance of damages consisting entirely of attorneys' fees was properly refused upon dissolution of a temporary injunction granted ex parte where substantive right of a plaintiff to the injunction was never examined or questioned and only basis upon which defendant sought recovery of damages was dissolution of the injunction. Sykas v. Alvarez, 126 Vt. 420, 234 A.2d 343 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Counsel fees incurred in the Supreme Court are not in general allowable as injunction damages, when the real thing litigated is a right for the protection of which injunction is sought as a remedy. Barre Water Co. v. Carnes, 68 Vt. 23, 33 A. 898 (1895), same case 65 Vt. 626, 27 A. 609, 164 A.L.R. 1110.

        The word "shall," as formerly used in this section, which provided that when an injunction is dissolved by final decree in favor of defendant injunction damages "shall be ascertained by reference to a master," was to be construed as synonymous with "may" and merely directory, and court could assess damages without such reference. Spaulding & Kimball Co. v. Aetna Chemical Co., 98 Vt. 169, 126 A. 588 (1924), same case 98 Vt. 51, 126 A. 582.

        This section did not contemplate the assessment of damages until after final decree has been entered. Spaulding & Kimball Co. v. Aetna Chemical Co., 98 Vt. 169, 126 A. 588 (1924), same case 98 Vt. 51, 126 A. 582.

        Where temporary injunction, issued to restrain prosecution of a personal action at law, was dissolved by order of court in vacation, after demurrer to complaint had been sustained, bill adjudged insufficient, and decree ordered for defendant, and, no appeal being taken within the statutory period, the decree had become final, defendant's subsequent motion for damages for the wrongful issuance of injunction, while the cause still remained on the docket, was timely. Spaulding & Kimball Co. v. Aetna Chemical Co., 98 Vt. 169, 126 A. 588 (1924), same case 98 Vt. 51, 126 A. 582.

        The power to enforce remuneration for losses under an injunction was an inherent power of courts of chancery. Couture v. Lowery, 122 Vt. 505, 177 A.2d 371 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        As between parties to suit, court of chancery had inherent power to assess damages caused by injunction, notwithstanding provisions of this section relating to assessment by reference to master. Houghton v. Grimes, 103 Vt. 54, 151 A. 642 (1930), same case 100 Vt. 99, 135 A. 15, 105 Vt. 230, 164 A. 371, 60 Harv. L. Rev. 468.
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an injunction restraining the prosecution of a suit at law is dissolved, ordinarily the power to assess injunction damages is inherent in court, independent of statute, and this section was not intended to deprive court of such power.

ADE Software Corp. v. Hoffman, 172 Vt. 259, 775 A.2d 896 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant's submissions to the trial court did not articulate with any specificity the contours of his damages, nor proffer any new evidence with respect to his claims, the court did not abuse its discretion in deciding that defendant failed to establish his right to injunction damages. ADE Software Corp. v. Hoffman, 172 Vt. 259, 775 A.2d 896 (2000).

       <p>
        Power of chancery court to enforce remuneration for losses under an injunction is an inherent power of the courts of chancery, because the right to remuneration is made a condition of the issuance of the injunction; this inherent power is based upon the principle that the party seeking the injunction has availed himself of the process of the court of chancery and must abide by its orders.

        If court has power to make payment of damages a condition on which an injunction issues and to require a bond to secure its performance, it must of necessity have the power to determine the damages. In re Crescent Beach Ass'n., 126 Vt. 448, 236 A.2d 497 (1967).

    </h5>
    <p>
     Under this subchapter, a foreclosure mortgagee obtains full and complete title and has the right to sell the foreclosed property and retain the surplus, if any, if no one redeems the foreclosed property within the prescribed period. Stowe Center, Inc. v. Burlington Savings Bank, 141 Vt. 634, 451 A.2d 1114 (1982).

     Where a foreclosing mortgagee sold the foreclosed property in the fall of 1980, after a certificate of nonredemption had been issued and recorded on July 27, 1978, the mortgagee had obtained full and complete title in the property and had the right to retain any surplus between the value received from the sale and the amount of the debt secured by the mortgage. Stowe Center, Inc. v. Burlington Savings Bank, 141 Vt. 634, 451 A.2d 1114 (1982).

        Where all facts relevant to foreclosure action, that is, execution of instruments and nonpayment, had been conceded, and trial before advisory jury was only upon counterclaim for cancellation of the instruments due to fraud, duress and lack of consideration, this section's provision that all proceedings in foreclosure actions shall be before the presiding judge alone and trial shall be without a jury did not apply to the trial.

       <p>
        The foreclosure decree is a final judgment, even though it creates a right to redeem, and, in Vermont, a debtor retains an interest in the property until the period of redemption is over. Mortgage Lenders Network, USA v. Sensenich, 177 Vt. 592, 873 A.2d 892 (mem.) (November 9, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        The mortgagor retains only the contingent equitable right to redeem the property, not full legal title to the property; thus, a foreclosure decree that is not timely appealed precludes the mortgagor, and any other bona fide purchaser, from contesting the validity of the mortgage or the interest of the mortgagee. Mortgage Lenders Network, USA v. Sensenich, 177 Vt. 592, 873 A.2d 892 (mem.) (November 9, 2004).

        When a mortgage deed is defectively witnessed under 27 V.S.A.
        ยงยง
        341(a) and 342, the issuance and recording of a foreclosure decree, without timely appeal, puts all subsequent purchasers on inquiry notice as to the mortgagee's equitable interest in the subject property; consequently, subsequent purchasers, including a bankruptcy trustee, cannot be considered bona fide purchasers without notice, and thus can acquire only the grantor's interest "impeded with its attendant equity." Mortgage Lenders Network, USA v. Sensenich, 177 Vt. 592, 873 A.2d 892 (mem.) (November 9, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because a mortgage had not been witnessed as required by Vermont law, the mortgage lien could be avoided under bankruptcy law. Recording a copy of foreclosure proceedings could not cure the fatal defect and create a valid instrument for purposes of constructive notice. Sensenich v. Mortgage Lenders Network, USA (In re Potter), - B.R. - (Bankr. D. Vt. Sept. 21, 2001).

       <p>
        In action filed by bank to foreclose mortgages held by it, where bank alleged that defendants' interest in the premises was subordinate to its mortgage by virtue of a subrogation agreement between the parties, since defendants' counterclaim and cross-claim tracked V.R.C.P. 80.1, setting forth the requirements for a complaint seeking foreclosure, and the relief requested was judgment against the other parties for all sums due and foreclosure of the equities of redemption of the other interested parties, defendants' pleadings constituted a claim for foreclosure; therefore, under subsection (c) of this section it was error for the trial court to grant defendants' request for a jury trial. Merchants Bank v. Thibodeau, 143 Vt. 132, 465 A.2d 258 (1983).

       <p>
        Test for whether foreclosure laws conform to substantive due process is whether they are rationally related to a legitimate State interest, the focus of analysis being on whether State's interest in burdening a class of people outweighs the due process interests of that class. Dieffenbach v. Attorney General of Vermont, 604 F.2d 187 (2d Cir. 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont's strict mortgage foreclosure laws directly engage the State's judicial power in effectuating foreclosure, and the official acts are sufficient state action to give Federal District Court jurisdiction over mortgagor's claim that the laws are unconstitutional as in violation of equal protection and due process. Dieffenbach v. Attorney General of Vermont, 604 F.2d 187 (2d Cir. 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Absent any suggestion that foreclosure laws operate to burden a suspect group or fundamental interest, appropriate standard for analyzing the laws under the Equal Protection Clause is whether they are rationally related to a conceivable legitimate State interest, and in such an economic matter court owes an extraordinary deference to State objectives, almost the equivalent of a strong presumption of constitutionality, and court must uphold any classification based upon facts that can reasonably be conceived to constitute a distinction or difference in state policy. Dieffenbach v. Attorney General of Vermont, 604 F.2d 187 (2d Cir. 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont strict foreclosure law, alleged to be in violation of due process and equal protection because a mortgagee obtaining possession and selling the property need not turn over to mortgagor any proceeds of a sale in excess of the remaining mortgage debt, is constitutional.

       <p>
        Where Chapter 13 debtors and the trustee unsuccessfully sought to void a mortgage of the debtor's home based on a defect in the mortgage acknowledgement, the mortgage lender was not entitled to an award of attorney's fees and costs pursuant to a provision in the mortgage because the court, exercising its discretion pursuant to 12 V.S.A.

       <p>
        An award of attorney's fees in a mortgage foreclosure action is discretionary; courts may allow only such fees as are just, even where a mortgage deed contains an agreement that mortgagor will pay mortgagee's attorney's fees in the event of foreclosure.

        Where the mortgage deed at issue in a foreclosure action provided for the power of sale and the defendant indicated that she built equity in the property which she felt should be returned to her in the event of foreclosure, these facts, in light of the parties' stipulation to invoke the power of sale, were enough to establish that subsection (a) of this section was invoked, and the trial court properly ordered foreclosure by power of sale.

        Nonjudicial foreclosure statute did not apply where defendant's action arose not as the result of a mortgagor-mortgagee relationship - but rather because of the provisions of the Uniform Common Interest Ownership Act, which provides a statutory right to a condominium association to institute a nonjudicial foreclosure proceeding for nonpayment of condominium dues.

       <p>
        United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of Vermont concludes that where a State court judgment provides a redemption date associated with a strict foreclosure proceeding, and also provides for a foreclosure sale (thus bringing the redemption periods under the two foreclosure procedures into conflict), and where a sale actually occurs, the foreclosure "event" is the sale and, as a result, the redemption period does not expire until the sale occurs, pursuant to 12 V.S.A
        ยง
        4532(i). In such a circumstance, the strict foreclosure redemption deadline would have no force and effect. In re Willette, 395 B.R. 308 (Bankr. D. Vt. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a Vermont judgment of foreclosure failed to specify whether the redemption period was based on a strict foreclosure or a foreclosure by sale, the foreclosure "event" was the sale and, pursuant to 12 V.S.A.
        ยง
        4532(i), the redemption period did not expire until the sale occurred, and the strict foreclosure redemption deadline had no force and effect. Because the debtor filed her bankruptcy petition three days before the sale occurred, her right to redeem had not expired prior to her filing of the bankruptcy case, she had a contingent equitable interest in her property on the date she filed her Chapter 13 petition, and accordingly, under 11 U.S.C.S.

        1322, the debtor could cure the pre-petition default. In re Willette, 395 B.R. 308 (Bankr. D. Vt. 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where individuals subject to proceedings under Chapter 13 of 11 U.S.C. (the United States Bankruptcy Code) lost their redemption right after the second mortgagee successfully brought a strict foreclosure proceeding in State court, the right was reinstated by a Federal District Court in the first mortgagee's subsequent foreclosure proceeding, giving debtors the right to use 11 U.S.C.S.

        1322 to reinstate and cure their mortgage. In re Bartlett, 353 B.R. 398 (Bankr. D. Vt. 2006).

       </h5>
       <p>
        An order overruling demurrer to a bill in equity and giving demurrant leave to replead was not a final order or decree from which an appeal could be taken. Page v. Page's Adm'r, 91 Vt. 188, 99 A. 780 (1917), same case 93 Vt. 190, 106 A. 774, 94 Vt. 306, 111 A. 398.
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a bill in chancery to restrain prosecution of action at law against a bank to recover deposits, made by defendant's attorney, alleged collusion between him and defendant to compel plaintiff to pay the deposits twice, and a temporary injunction was issued, the subsequent dissolution thereof, leaving plaintiff at liberty to take proceedings to establish the alleged conspiracy, was not a "final order," and so not appealable. Vermont Sav. Bank v. Bailey, 87 Vt. 220, 88 A. 561 (1913).
       </p>
       <p>
        Decree in chancery appointing a master to ascertain and report injunction damages, and restraining plaintiffs from delaying, hindering, or preventing defendant from taking and holding possession of the land in controversy "until further order of court," was interlocutory merely, and so unappealable. McArthur v. Blondin, 86 Vt. 62, 83 A. 468 (1912), same case 84 Vt. 516, 80 A. 663.
       </p>
       <p>
        A pro forma decree overruling demurrer to a bill in chancery was interlocutory, hence no appeal lay. Taft v. Mossey's Adm'r, 77 Vt. 165, 59 A. 166 (1904); Jones v. Stearns, 96 Vt. 138, 117 A. 663 (1922), same case 97 Vt. 37, 122 A. 116; St. Albans Hosp. v. Enosburg, 96 Vt. 152, 118 A. 484 (1921), same case 96 Vt. 389, 120 A. 97; Wright & Valley v. Creamery Package Co., 77 Vt. 17, 58 A. 803 (1904).
       </p>
       <p>
        A final order or decree is one that settles rights of parties under issues made by pleadings. Nelson v. Brown, 59 Vt. 600, 10 A. 721 (1887); Fitzgerald v. Fitzgerald, 95 Vt. 301, 115 A. 99 (1921), same case 91 Vt. 266, 99 A. 774, 94 Vt. 306, 1 398; Page v.

        When a bill is taken pro confesso, no appeal lies from the decree and the allegations in the bill are impliedly admitted. Paine v. Slocum, 56 Vt. 504 (1884).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court of Chancery could vacate a decree made in consequence of a bill being taken as confessed, so as to permit a defense to the suit upon its merits, but application for this purpose was addressed to discretion of court of chancery, and could not be considered and determined by Supreme Court. Hall v. Lamb, 28 Vt. 85 (1855).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant neglected to answer a bill in chancery, agreeably to rules of court, and bill was, on that account, taken as confessed, and a decree was made thereon, the cause was not appealable, though defendant had not neglected to appear. Hart v. Strong, 15 Vt. 377 (1843).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The appeal procedure of this section is covered by the "foreclosed and redeemed" language of subsection 12 V.S.A.
        ยง
        2903(c). Darden v. O'Keefe, 171 Vt. 571, 762 A.2d 852 (mem.) (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the permission requirement of this section applies to appeals of judgment lien enforcement orders, the court had the power to condition permission to appeal on posting a bond, and defendant's failure to post the bond deprived the Supreme Court of jurisdiction over the appeal. Darden v. O'Keefe, 171 Vt. 571, 762 A.2d 852 (mem.) (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislative policy of promoting the finality of foreclosure judgments would be thwarted if this section could be circumvented simply by filing a motion to reopen weeks or months after the entry of the foreclosure judgment; this is particularly true in situations where the redemption period has expired. Citibank, N.A. v. Groshens, 171 Vt. 639, 768 A.2d 1272 (mem.) (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme Court is without authority to entertain a purported appeal from a decree of foreclosure where permission from the court below to take the appeal, as required by this section, does not appear in the record. LaDuke Estate v. LaDuke, 126 Vt. 27, 220 A.2d 474 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section party to foreclosure proceedings was not entitled to an appeal except by leave of chancellor. Factory Point Nat'l Bank v. Equinox Co., 110 Vt. 277, 5 A.2d 462 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        In exercise of discretion vested in him by this section, chancellor was authorized to impose reasonable conditions upon his allowance of appeal by defendant in foreclosure proceedings, one of which could be filing of bond to protect plaintiffs. Factory Point Nat'l Bank v. Equinox Co., 110 Vt. 277, 5 A.2d 462 (1939); Vermont-People's Nat'l Bank v. Robertson, 102 Vt. 379, 148 A. 408 (1929).

       <p>
        Attempted appeal from decree of foreclosure without permission of chancellor will be dismissed. Ludlow Savings Bank & Trust Co. v. Knight, 91 Vt. 172, 99 A. 633 (1917).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appeal from decree of court of chancery sustaining assessment by clerk of sum due in equity upon foreclosure of a real estate mortgage was an appeal from a decree of foreclosure within meaning of this section. Ludlow Savings Bank & Trust Co. v. Knight, 91 Vt. 172, 99 A. 633 (1917).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section, regulating appeals in foreclosure cases, applied only to mortgages which were such on their face, or were recognized as such by parties, and not to cases where character of instrument was in issue. Herrick's Adm'r v. Teachout, 74 Vt. 196, 52 A. 432 (1901).

        Only question before Supreme Court, under notice of appeal from decree, where exceptions to findings have been waived, is whether decree is warranted by pleadings and supported by the findings. Century Indemnity Co. v. Mead, 121 Vt. 434, 159 A.2d 325 (1960).

         8. Discretionary matters.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Appeal of a decree of foreclosure and related issues relating to the parties' agreements for purchase of real property was properly before the court on appeal, although the purchasers did not seek permission to appeal, as the provision requiring permission to appeal only applied to mortgages which were such on their face or recognized as such by the parties; in the instant matter, the character of the instrument was in issue. Prue v. Royer, 193 Vt. 267, 67 A.3d 895 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the chancellor had granted or denied equitable relief by the exercise of discretion based on equitable considerations, the result was reviewable only upon a clear and affirmative showing of abuse. Johnson v. Johnson, 125 Vt. 470, 218 A.2d 43 (1966).

         9. Review of denial of permission to appeal.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Supreme Court had jurisdiction to consider decision denying defendant permission to appeal from decree of foreclosure because the motion for permission to appeal was denied for untenable reasons. Nationwide Mutual Fire Insurance Co. v. Gamelin, 173 Vt. 45, 786 A.2d 1078 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where trial court did not indicate reasons for denying defendants' request to appeal grant of foreclosure petition, Supreme Court was unable to evaluate the court's reasons for denying permission; as such, Supreme Court decided to consider matter, notwithstanding denial. Capital Impact Corp. v. Munro, 162 Vt. 6, 642 A.2d 1175 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although, under this section, the trial court's permission is required for review of judgments of foreclosure, the Supreme Court retains jurisdiction to review a trial court's denial of a mortgagor's motion for permission to appeal under an abuse of discretion standard. Vermont National Bank v. Clark, 156 Vt. 143, 588 A.2d 621 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court abused its discretion in denying permission to appeal judgment of foreclosure; the denial was based on mistaken understanding, which was prejudicial to the defendants, that in foreclosure actions the law precluded assertion of affirmative defenses concerning mortgagee's conduct prior to the creation of the mortgage. Vermont National Bank v. Clark, 156 Vt. 143, 588 A.2d 621 (1991).

      A judgment so rendered by confession, after the commencement of the suit, shall have the same effect to hold property attached or bail taken on mesne process, as if judgment had been rendered in the ordinary course of proceedings; but a confession of judgment by a debtor, after an action commenced against him or her, shall not be effectual to hold property attached where the same property has been subsequently attached by other creditors, as against them, unless the consent of all subsequent attaching creditors to such confession has been previously obtained in writing.

     Federal court did not have jurisdiction to hear a taxpayer's request for declaratory and injunctive relief seeking to avoid payment of Vermont's Electrical Energy Generating Tax (EET), imposed under 32 V.S.A.
     ยง
     8661, alleging the tax was unconstitutional, because (1) the taxpayer was able to seek a refund of the tax, and, (2) absent an adequate State administrative remedy, the taxpayer still had a "plain, speedy and efficient" State remedy since the taxpayer's challenge to the EET could be brought directly in Vermont's State courts under Vermont's Declaratory Judgments Act, 12 V.S.A.

    </p>
    <p>
     This chapter provided a procedural vehicle and remedy that was not previously available to litigants, but it did not extend jurisdiction of courts over subject matter or parties, and thus if municipalities did not otherwise have capacity to sue State, this chapter did not provide it. Town of Andover v. State, 170 Vt. 552, 742 A.2d 756 (mem.) (1999).
    </p>
    <p>
     Although the Superior Court has general statutory authority to grant declaratory relief, declaratory judgment statutes do not ipso jure vest jurisdiction in the Superior Court over claims jurisdiction over which the legislature has granted to other tribunals. Williams v. State, 156 Vt. 42, 589 A.2d 840 (1990), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 821, 112 S. Ct. 81, 116 L. Ed. 2d 54, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 984, 112 S. Ct. 590, 116 L. Ed. 2d 614 (1991).

      3. Pleadings.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     The Vermont Rules of Civil Procedure do not recognize a motion for declaratory judgment; ordinarily, a declaratory judgment action may be brought only as an independent action, a counterclaim or cross-claim. Price v. Leland, 149 Vt. 518, 546 A.2d 793 (1988).
    </p>
    <p>
     Where defendants' "Motion for Declaratory Judgment" was treated, without objection from plaintiff, as a counterclaim for declaratory judgment, it became part of the case as such. Price v. Leland, 149 Vt. 518, 546 A.2d 793 (1988).
    </p>
    <p>
     Defendants' "Motion for Declaratory Judgment," which satisfied the requirements of a summary judgment motion, would be considered as a motion for summary judgment seeking a declaration of the rights of the parties. Price v. Leland, 149 Vt. 518, 546 A.2d 793 (1988).
    </p>
    <h5 id="t12p09c167-annotations-4">
     <b>
      4. Standing to appeal.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     In order to establish standing to seek declaratory relief, plaintiff must allege at least the threat of an injury in fact to some protected interest. Richards v. Town of Norwich, 169 Vt. 44, 726 A.2d 81 (1999).
    </p>
    <p>
     Landowner's appeal from selectboard's approval of his neighbor's septic system alleged threat of an injury in fact to a protected interest, and was thus sufficient to establish his standing to seek declaratory relief, since it was reasonable to infer that a septic system that not only failed to comply with State standards, but also town's unapproved standards, would give rise to an invasion of landowner's right to the use and enjoyment of his property. Richards v. Town of Norwich, 169 Vt. 44, 726 A.2d 81 (1999).
    </p>
    <p>
     In a declaratory judgment action brought by plaintiff-insurer against its insured to seek a determination that it did not have to defend or indemnify its insured in a civil action over a shooting death on insured's property, the administrator of the victim's estate (the tort-plaintiff in a wrongful death suit brought against the insured), who was added by plaintiff as a defendant in the declaratory action, had standing to appeal the decision of the court finding that plaintiff did not have any duty. If defendant had not been a full party in the declaratory judgment action, he would not have been bound by it, and could have obtained a judgment against the insured tortfeasor and relitigated the question of coverage pursuant to 8 V.S.A.
     ยง
     4203(3). Consistent with the remedial purpose of the Declaratory Judgment Act, the only efficient course of action was to join the tort-plaintiff in the declaratory judgment action, give him full-party status, and allow him to appeal because the judgment affected him adversely. Cooperative Fire Insurance Ass'n of Vermont v. Bizon, 166 Vt. 326, 693 A.2d 722 (1997).

         1. Purpose.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Declaratory Judgments Act is remedial statute entitled to liberal construction to effectuate its salutary purpose. Neal v. Brockway, 136 Vt. 119, 385 A.2d 1069 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Purpose of declaratory judgment is to enunciate, so far as is requested and appropriate, the rights of the parties, and where clarification was not forthcoming in lower court and declaration was not carried out, reversal and remand were required. Shaw v. Barrows, 134 Vt. 343, 359 A.2d 651 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        The function of a declaratory judgment is to provide a declaration of rights, status and other legal relations of parties to an actual or justiciable controversy, and the claimed result or consequences must be so set forth that the court can see that they are not based upon fear or anticipation, but are reasonably to be expected. Robtoy v. City of St. Albans, 132 Vt. 503, 321 A.2d 45 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        The function of a declaratory judgment is to provide a declaration of rights status and other legal relations of parties to a justiciable controversy, and if such a controversy is not present, the declaratory judgment can provide no more than an advisory opinion, which the State judiciary does not have the constitutional power to render. Lace v. U.V.M., 131 Vt. 170, 303 A.2d 475 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Purpose of declaratory judgment action is to enunciate, so far as is requested and appropriate, the rights of the parties. Graves v. Town of Waitsfield, 130 Vt. 292, 292 A.2d 247 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        The declaratory judgment act was designed to supply deficiencies in legal procedure which existed prior to its enactment, and was not intended as a substitute for remedies in use before its enactment. Poulin v. Town of Danville, 128 Vt. 161, 260 A.2d 208 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of a declaratory judgment action is to enunciate, so far as is requested and is appropriate, the rights of all parties. Campbell v. Blair, 127 Vt. 157, 241 A.2d 791 (1968).

       <p>
        This chapter provided a procedural vehicle and remedy that was not previously available to litigants, but it did not extend jurisdiction of courts over subject matter or parties, and thus if municipalities did not otherwise have capacity to sue State, this chapter did not provide it. Town of Andover v. State, 170 Vt. 552, 742 A.2d 756 (mem.) (1999).

        Relief sought in proceeding under Declaratory Judgment Act is declaration of respective rights of parties within issues presented. Fish v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., 126 Vt. 487, 236 A.2d 648 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Action under uniform declaratory judgments act is equitable in nature and is governed by applicable, established rules of pleading. Manchester v. Townshend, 109 Vt. 65, 192 A. 22 (1937).

       <p>
        Bare existence of another adequate remedy is not bar to declaratory judgment proceeding where controversy exists and provides insufficient basis for trial court to invoke applicable statute to dismiss complaint. Neal v. Brockway, 136 Vt. 119, 385 A.2d 1069 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the action does not derive from litigation already commenced, the consequences giving rise to the seeking of declaratory relief must be set out so that the court can see they are based upon a reasonable and realistic expectation of their actual occurrence and not on a concern merely anticipatory of feared. Beecham v. Leahy, 130 Vt. 164, 287 A.2d 836 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where physician was under no compulsion, in any legal sense, to accede to plaintiff's request for an abortion, he could not challenge constitutionality of abortion statute by way of a declaratory judgment proceeding. Beecham v. Leahy, 130 Vt. 164, 287 A.2d 836 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where pregnant female could not sue the doctor for an action that could not be compelled, performing an abortion, yet was not herself subject to legal action by statutory exemption, she had standing to seek action through a declaratory judgment proceeding. Beecham v. Leahy, 130 Vt. 164, 287 A.2d 836 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        A declaratory judgment action is the proper avenue to determine ownership of property for tax purposes. San Remo Realty Corporation v. City of Montpelier, 130 Vt. 607, 298 A.2d 810 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        If question sought to be answered is one of law or jurisdiction of a zoning board of adjustment, it is judicial economy and wisdom to decide the issue by declaratory judgment before administrative channels have been entered or exhausted. Flanders Lumber & Building Supply Co. v. Town of Milton, 128 Vt. 38, 258 A.2d 804 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Declaratory judgment act was designed to supply deficiencies in legal procedure which existed before its enactment and was not intended as a substitute for ample remedies in use before its adoption. Glover v. Anderson, 120 Vt. 153, 134 A.2d 612 (1957).
       </p>

       </p>
       <p>
        Proceeding for declaratory judgment is cumulative remedy and jurisdiction is not absolutely barred by the existence of some other remedy. Farm Bureau Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Houle, 118 Vt. 154, 102 A.2d 326 (1953).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court of chancery properly assumed jurisdiction in granting declaratory relief to housing developers denied building permits for four lots, even though administrative remedies had not been exhausted as to one of the denials and two of the denials were before the county court on appeal. Farm Bureau Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Houle, 118 Vt. 154, 102 A.2d 326 (1953).

         4. Prerequisites.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Declaratory relief is available only when a party is suffering from the threat of actual injury to a protected legal interest; unless such a justiciable controversy is present, a declaratory judgment is merely an advisory opinion which the Supreme Court lacks authority to render. Doria v. University of Vermont, 156 Vt. 114, 589 A.2d 317 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        The availability of declaratory relief turns on whether the facts alleged, under all circumstances, show that there is a substantial controversy, between parties having adverse legal interests, of sufficient immediacy and reality to warrant the issuance of a declaratory judgment. Williams v. State, 156 Vt. 42, 589 A.2d 840 (1990), cert. denied, 502 U.S. 821, 112 S. Ct. 81, 116 L. Ed. 2d 54, cert. denied, 502 U.S. 984, 112 S. Ct. 590, 116 L. Ed. 2d 614 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        As a prerequisite to declaratory relief, it is vital that issues raised by allegations in the bill, which have been specifically denied, be established by the trier of the facts. Harte v. Peerless Ins. Co., 123 Vt. 120, 183 A.2d 223 (1962).

         5. Controversy.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where unsuccessful candidate and voter sought declaration that promise by successful candidate to divide his salary, when elected, among the fire departments and rescue squads in his district, was void and unenforceable, and injunction against promise being carried out, plaintiffs were not parties to the dispute, their personal or property rights were not adversely affected in manner different from public generally, and therefore, order or judgment would not resolve any presently subsisting justiciable dispute between the parties. Pearl v. Curran, 135 Vt. 171, 376 A.2d 19 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        The actual controversy required for a declaratory judgment was not shown where tax exemption was sought by disabled veteran, and he, on the face of his complaint, had not established that he was liable for the taxes on the property in question or that any attempt had been made to collect any tax from him for which he was exempt. Robtoy v. City of St. Albans, 132 Vt. 503, 321 A.2d 45 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where complaint for declaratory relief, seeking judgment that complainant was exempt from certain tax, failed to enunciate an actual or justiciable controversy, the judgment could only be limited to denial of the relief requested, and declaration that property was not entitled to tax exemption must be stricken from judgment order. Robtoy v. City of St. Albans, 132 Vt. 503, 321 A.2d 45 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        A clear controversy existed where, due to boundary dispute, each of two towns claimed the right to tax and did tax part of the land of landowners seeking declaratory judgment as to which town taxes were legally owed. Poulin v. Town of Danville, 128 Vt. 161, 260 A.2d 208 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act is well suited to a controversy where declaration of rights, as well as equitable relief, is required to stabilize and quiet the relations between parties. Price v. Rowell, 121 Vt. 393, 159 A.2d 622 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        When declaratory decree will serve a useful purpose in clarifying legal relations of parties or if it will terminate uncertainty and insecurity of controversy, the court should render relief prayed. Commercial Ins. Co. v. Papandrea, 121 Vt. 386, 159 A.2d 333 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        Declaratory relief may be available to settle disputed issues of fact. Commercial Ins. Co. v. Papandrea, 121 Vt. 386, 159 A.2d 333 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        Proceeding for declaratory judgment must be based upon actual controversy and claimed result or consequences must be so set forth that court can see they are not based upon fear or anticipation but are reasonably to be expected. Gifford Memorial Hosp. v. Town of Randolph, 119 Vt. 66, 118 A.2d 480 (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        When insured does not cooperate so that insurer may obtain from him an agreement allowing it to defend with reservations, petition for declaratory judgment to determine coverage under the policy may be maintained. Farm Bureau Mut. Auto. Ins. Co. v. Houle, 118 Vt. 154, 102 A.2d 326 (1953).

         6. Jurisdiction.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Civil division has original and exclusive jurisdiction of all original civil actions, apart from certain exceptions; moreover, within that general jurisdiction, the divisions of the superior court have the power under the Declaratory Judgment Act to declare rights, status, and other legal relations whether or not further relief is or could be claimed. Hence, the civil division presumptively had jurisdiction over the declaratory judgment action here, and defendant was required to preserve, by raising before the trial court, his contention that the court lacked authority under the circumstances of the case to adjudicate plaintiff's request for declaratory relief. Burlington School District v. Provost, 211 Vt. 277, 224 A.3d 841 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Declaratory Judgment Act allows parties who have a dispute within a court's jurisdiction to petition that court for declaratory relief at an early stage of the proceedings; however, the Act does not increase or enlarge the jurisdiction of the court over any subject matter or parties. Vermont State Employees' Ass'n v. Criminal Justice Training Council, 167 Vt. 191, 704 A.2d 769 (1997).
       </p>

        Prayer for declaratory relief has effect of invoking Superior Court jurisdiction under Declaratory Judgments Act. Neal v. Brockway, 136 Vt. 119, 385 A.2d 1069 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where legislature has provided that certain rights are enforcible in specified tribunals, the declaratory judgments vehicle should not be used to frustrate that legislative choice. Trivento v. Commissioner of Corrections, 135 Vt. 475, 380 A.2d 69 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where part of the trust property is land in the State, the Vermont courts have jurisdiction in a declaratory judgment action of the administration of that part of the trust. Avery v. Bender, 124 Vt. 309, 204 A.2d 314 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Uniform Declaratory Judgments Act confers upon county courts, and upon courts of chancery and probate, within their respective jurisdictions, power to adjudicate and declare the rights of the parties in legal controversies, at their inception. Commercial Ins. Co. v. Papandrea, 121 Vt. 386, 159 A.2d 333 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        Uniform declaratory judgments act has not enlarged the jurisdiction of courts over subject matter or parties, but, in opening to prospective defendants and plaintiffs a right to petition for relief not heretofore possessed, has, in that sense, extended power of courts to grant relief in cases otherwise within their jurisdiction to pass upon. Gifford Memorial Hosp. v. Town of Randolph, 119 Vt. 66, 118 A.2d 480 (1955); Murray v. Cartmell's Ex'r, 118 Vt. 178, 102 A.2d 853 (1954).
       </p>

        Petition for declaratory judgment cannot be brought to court of chancery unless such facts are alleged as will give that court jurisdiction of subject matter. Murray v. Cartmell's Ex'r, 118 Vt. 178, 102 A.2d 853 (1954); Curtis v. O'Brien, 117 Vt. 52, 84 A.2d 584 (1951).

It had recognized the existence of a previously laid-out road, noting its course, and had done so with adequate clarity. Benson v. Hodgdon, 187 Vt. 607, 992 A.2d 1053 (mem.) (2010).

        In proceeding by landowners for declaratory judgment to resolve boundary dispute and determine to which of two towns taxing plaintiffs land plaintiffs legally owed taxes, a community of interest, allowing joinder of towns as defendants, existed in the subject matter of the litigation, consisting of jurisdiction to tax the land.

       <p>
        In equity, there may be joinder of defendants where there is community of interest in questions of law and fact, and only under such situation can there be joinder of defendants under the declaratory judgments act according to established rules of pleading.

        Statute which required that municipality be made a party in any declaratory judgment proceeding involving validity of a municipal ordinance essentially made town whose ordinance was at issue a "necessary" party within meaning of procedural rule.

        Supreme Court could address validity of municipal ordinance notwithstanding trial court's failure to order joinder of town and consider claims in first instance, since remand would undoubtedly result in a second appeal, issues were fully briefed and argued and carefully considered by Supreme Court, and town did not stand to be prejudiced by Court's consideration of claims.

       <p>
        Findings by the trial court that the dispute over a particular covenant has not been resolved, and that the determination of the meaning of the restrictive covenant was not premature, in conjunction with the history of previous litigation, sufficiently satisfied the "case or controversy" requirement for jurisdictional purposes. Cupola Golf Course, Inc. v. Dooley, 179 Vt. 427, 898 A.2d 134 (April 14, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        An action for declaratory relief must be based upon an actual controversy, the claimed result of which is not based upon fear or anticipation, but is reasonably to be expected. Thus, to avoid the probability of an advisory opinion, there must be a "case or controversy." Cupola Golf Course, Inc. v. Dooley, 179 Vt. 427, 898 A.2d 134 (April 14, 2006).

    </p>
    <p>
     "(1) 'Emergency period' means the period beginning with the Governor's declaration of a state of emergency on March 13, 2020, arising from COVID-19, and ending 30 days after the Governor terminates the state of emergency by declaration.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) 'Ejectment' refers to an ejectment action brought under 9 V.S.A. chapter 137 and 12 V.S.A. chapter 169 against the tenant of a residential dwelling unit, or under 10 V.S.A. chapter 153 against a mobile home park resident.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(3)(A) 'Foreclosure' refers to a foreclosure action brought under 12 V.S.A. chapter 172 against a dwelling house, as defined in 12 V.S.A.
     ยง
     4931(2), that is occupied.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(B) For purposes of this act, a dwelling house is deemed to be occupied unless all of the following are true:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(i) There are circumstances that would lead a reasonable person to believe that the dwelling house is not occupied as a full-time residence, including evidence that utilities are disconnected, mail is not being delivered, or the dwelling house is empty of necessary household furnishings.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(ii) The mortgage on the dwelling house is not current.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(iii) The mortgagee has made reasonable attempts to ascertain the mortgagor's residence and has a reasonable belief that the dwelling house is no longer the mortgagor's residence.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(b) Duties. This section does not:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(1) relieve a tenant of the obligation to pay rent pursuant to 9 V.S.A.
     ยง
     4455;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) relieve a tenant in a pending ejectment action of the obligation to pay rent into court pursuant to an existing order under 12 V.S.A.
     ยง
     4853a;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(3) relieve a borrower under a residential loan agreement of the obligation to make timely payments pursuant to the terms of the loan agreement; or
    </p>
    <p>
     "(4) limit a court's ability to act in an emergency pursuant to Administrative Order 49, issued by the Vermont Supreme Court, as amended, which may include an action that involves criminal activity, illegal drug activity, or acts of violence, or other circumstances that seriously threaten the health or safety of other residents.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(c) Pending foreclosure and ejectment actions.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(1) Upon the effective date of this act, all pending actions for ejectment under 12 V.S.A. chapter 169, actions for foreclosure under 12 V.S.A. chapter 172, and any outstanding orders in those actions that could lead to execution of a writ of possession against a tenant or resident are stayed until the end of the emergency period.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) A court of this State, before which is any matter stayed pursuant to subdivision (1) of this subsection, shall issue any necessary orders and provide notice to the parties of the stay.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(d) New foreclosure and ejectment actions. During the emergency period, after the effective date of this act, a landlord may commence an ejectment action pursuant to 9 V.S.A. chapter 137 and 12 V.S.A. chapter 169, and a residential mortgage lender may commence a foreclosure action pursuant to 12 V.S.A. chapter 172, subject to the following:
    </p>

     "(1) The plaintiff may commence the action only by filing with the Civil Division of the Superior Court and not by service pursuant to V.R.C.P. 3.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) The court shall stay the action as of the date of filing until the end of the emergency period.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(3) The plaintiff shall not attempt to serve and a sheriff or constable shall not serve any civil process.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(4) The deadline for completing service of process pursuant to V.R.C.P. 3 is 60 days after the emergency period ends.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(e) Writs of possession not yet issued. During the emergency period, a court shall not issue a writ of possession:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(1) in an ejectment action:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(A) pursuant to 12 V.S.A.
     ยง
     4853a(h) because a tenant failed to pay rent into court; or
    </p>
    <p>
     "(B) pursuant to 12 V.S.A.
     ยง
     4854 if the court has entered a judgment in favor of the plaintiff but did not issue a writ of possession with the judgment; or
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) in a strict foreclosure action pursuant to 12 V.S.A.
     ยง
     4941(e) because the property is not redeemed; or

     ยง
     4946(d) upon expiration of all periods of redemption.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(f) Writs of possession already issued.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(1) A writ of possession that was issued by a court prior to the effective date of this act is stayed as of the start date of the emergency period and resumes running when the Governor terminates the state of emergency by declaration.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) If a writ of possession was issued but not executed prior to the effective date of this act, then after the Governor terminates the state of emergency by declaration:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(A) the plaintiff shall serve or serve again the writ to the defendant; and
    </p>
    <p>
     "(B) the plaintiff shall be restored to possession not sooner than 14 days after service.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(g) Rent escrow hearings.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(1) For any hearing on a motion to order a defendant to pay rent into court that occurs within the first 45 days after the emergency period ends, if the court finds that the tenant is obligated to pay rent and has failed to do so, then notwithstanding 12 V.S.A.
     ยง
     4853a(d), the court shall order the defendant to pay into court:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(A) rent as it accrues from the date of the order while the proceeding is pending; and
    </p>
    <p>
     "(B) rent accrued from:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(i) the date the motion was served, if the motion was served after the effective date of this act; or
    </p>
    <p>
     "(ii) the end of the emergency period, if the motion was served before the effective date of this act.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) The court may reduce the amount of rent the defendant must pay into court under this subsection after considering:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(A) the tenant's inability to pay due to circumstances arising in the emergency period; and
    </p>
    <p>
     "(B) whether the tenant made good faith attempts to secure available emergency rental payment funds.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(h) Resumption of actions for breach of rental agreement. Notwithstanding any provision of this act to the contrary, an ejectment action for breach of a rental agreement pursuant to 9 V.S.A.
     ยง
     4467(b) may proceed in court when the Governor terminates the state of emergency by declaration."

       <p>
        When the parties had a contract for deed, rather than a landlord-tenant relationship, plaintiff could not obtain relief in the form of back rent; rather, on remand, the trial court was to treat his complaint as a claim for mesne profits under a theory that defendant had held the property without right.

        Rule of damages is one generally governing in tort actions, which has for its foundation the doctrine of compensation for pecuniary loss resulting from unlawful act, and when rental value alone does not afford such compensation additional recovery may be had, and the wrongdoer must respond for gains prevented as well as for losses sustained, so far as same are sufficiently alleged and proved.

        To warrant recovery of profits of which plaintiff has been deprived, profits claimed must not be uncertain, speculative, or remote; but such as proof reasonably shows plaintiff to have been proximately deprived of by defendant's wrongful act are recoverable. Capital Garage Co. v. Powell, 98 Vt. 303, 127 A. 375 (1924), same case 96 Vt. 145, 227, 118 A. 524, 883, 97 Vt. 328, 123 A. 200, 99 Vt. 12, 130 A. 754, 99 Vt. 244, 131 A. 10.

       <p>
        Prospective profits necessarily depend upon various conditions, which are for consideration of jury, to be given such effect as its judgment dictates, and need not be susceptible of calculation with mathematical exactness, if there is sufficient foundation for a rational conclusion. Capital Garage Co. v. Powell, 98 Vt. 303, 127 A. 375 (1924), same case 96 Vt. 145, 227, 118 A. 524, 883, 97 Vt. 328, 123 A. 200, 99 Vt. 12, 130 A. 754, 99 Vt. 244, 131 A. 10.

        In action of tort by successful party in ejectment, for damages for unlawfully withholding garage property, evidence regarding garage business done on premises by occupant thereof during plaintiff's exclusion therefrom, was admissible, and its exclusion prejudicial error. Capital Garage Co. v. Powell, 98 Vt. 303, 127 A. 375 (1924), same case 96 Vt. 145, 227, 118 A. 524, 883, 97 Vt. 328, 123 A. 200, 99 Vt. 12, 130 A. 754, 99 Vt. 244, 131 A. 10.
       </p>
       <p>
        In such action, evidence of net earnings during previous occupancy of premises by plaintiff, if not referring to time too remote, was admissible, and question of remoteness was addressed to trial court's discretion. Capital Garage Co. v. Powell, 98 Vt. 303, 127 A. 375 (1924), same case 96 Vt. 145, 227, 118 A. 524, 883, 97 Vt. 328, 123 A. 200, 99 Vt. 12, 130 A. 754, 99 Vt. 244, 131 A. 10.
       </p>
       <p>
        In such action, ruling of trial court admitting evidence of net profits during previous occupancy of premises by plaintiff will be presumed to have been made in the exercise of its discretion, the contrary not appearing. Capital Garage Co. v. Powell, 98 Vt. 303, 127 A. 375 (1924), same case 96 Vt. 145, 227, 118 A. 524, 883, 97 Vt. 328, 123 A. 200, 99 Vt. 12, 130 A. 754, 99 Vt. 244, 131 A. 10.
       </p>
       <p>
        In such action, evidence of one who had worked in the garage during plaintiff's previous occupancy thereof that business was good was admissible as tending to show the amount of mesne profits which defendant received or ought to have received. Capital Garage Co. v. Powell, 98 Vt. 303, 127 A. 375 (1924), same case 96 Vt. 145, 227, 118 A. 524, 883, 97 Vt. 328, 123 A. 200, 99 Vt. 12, 130 A. 754, 99 Vt. 244, 131 A. 10.
       </p>
       <p>
        In such action, evidence of prospective profits is received, not as furnishing measure of damages to be adopted by jury, but to be taken into consideration by jury as a guide in arriving at correct estimate of plaintiff's loss. Capital Garage Co. v. Powell, 98 Vt. 303, 127 A. 375 (1924), same case 96 Vt. 145, 227, 118 A. 524, 883, 97 Vt. 328, 123 A. 200, 99 Vt. 12, 130 A. 754, 99 Vt. 244, 131 A. 10.

     <p>
      In actions of ejectment for nonpayment of rent, the plaintiff shall not be required to prove a demand of the rent in arrear or a stipulation for reentry on nonpayment of rent or a reentry on the premises, but shall recover judgment as if the rent in arrear had been demanded and reentry made. Before a writ of possession is executed, if the defendant pays into court all rent due through the end of the current rental period, including interest and the costs of suit, the action shall be discontinued. A defendant may not defeat an ejectment action by payment of all rent in arrears, interest, and court costs more than one time in 12 months. The 12-month period shall begin on the day the payment is made.

        Right of tenant to relieve himself from forfeiture for nonpayment of rent by bringing his money into court is secured to him by provisions of this section, and that remedy is not denied, either at law or in equity, by failure to pay rent as stipulated in lease or by failure to deliver possession under promise in lease to do so on failure to pay rent when due.

      When the plaintiff commences an action of ejectment, the defendant shall counterclaim for the value of the improvements made upon the land by him or her or by those under whom he or she claims, if he or she or his or her predecessors in title purchased the land recovered in the action, supposing the title to be good in fee at the time of the purchase, or if he or she or his or her predecessors in title took a lease of the land supposing that lease to convey the title and interest therein expressed at the time the lease was accepted. Recovery on the counterclaim shall be contingent on the plaintiff's recovery on the claim for ejectment.
    The increase in the value of the land in consequence of betterments so made shall be held to be the value of the betterments.

        Statute provides for distinct proceeding, in which matter of improvements can be brought to distinct issue and tried on what legitimately bears on subject. Ford v. Flint, 40 Vt. 382 (1867).
       </p>
       <p>
        In declaration for betterments, it must be determined, on trial before jury, whether there could be a recovery, and the question could not be raised by special pleadings which terminate in demurrer. Beckley v. Willard, 13 Vt. 533 (1841).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether a party was entitled to recover for his betterments must be determined on trial of declaration filed therefor, and could not be decided by court who gave judgment in action of ejectment, on motion. Gaige v. Ladd, 5 Vt. 266 (1833), same case 6 Vt. 174.
       </p>
       <p>
        Right to file declaration for betterments did not depend on facts which appeared in evidence or proceedings had in trial of action of ejectment. Gaige v. Ladd, 5 Vt. 266 (1833), same case 6 Vt. 174.

        No recovery could be had in a declaration for betterments founded on an alleged want of title in defendant (the recovering party in ejectment). Brown v. Storm, 4 Vt. 37 (1831).

        Right of party to betterments depends on his bona fide supposition that he was buying title in fee, and not on whether he actually was buying fee. Rutland R.R. v. Chaffee, 72 Vt. 404, 48 A. 700 (1900), same case 71 Vt. 84, 42 A. 984; Kendall v. Tracy, 64 Vt. 522, 24 A. 1118 (1892); Whitney v. Richardson, 31 Vt. 300 (1858).
       </p>
       <p>
        This right does not depend upon nature or kind of title which real owner may have, nor upon his having had right to the immediate possession at the time betterments were made; nor on his negligence in asserting his title. Whitney v. Richardson, 31 Vt. 300 (1858).
       </p>
       <p>
        If defendant in ejectment purchased with belief that he was obtaining perfect title in fee, fact that party in chain of his title purchased without such belief on his part, did not prevent defendant from recovering for betterments made by all others in chain of his title who purchased with such belief on their part, whether prior or subsequent to such party.

       <p>
        Constructive notice which law implies from registry of deed was not sufficient to preclude one from recovering for betterments, who in fact purchased in good faith and with supposition that he was obtaining perfect title in fee. Whitney v. Richardson, 31 Vt. 300 (1858).

       <p>
        Interrelationship between mesne profits and the cost of improvements made by the occupant is governed by the statute which provides that the amount of mesne profits awarded must be just and equitable, in view of the improvements made by the occupant; the statute also applies to cases that do not involve a landlord-tenant relationship. Thus, in a suit involving a contract for deed, the trial court could offset the cost of the improvements made by defendant against the mesne profits owed to plaintiff, as well as reduce the monthly mesne profits for the periods when the repairs or improvements were needed, but not made. Kellogg v. Shushereba, 194 Vt. 446, 82 A.3d 1121 (2013).

       <p>
        Defendants in an action of justice ejectment are not entitled to recover for betterments made to property. Canfield v. Hall, 121 Vt. 479, 160 A.2d 768 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        Justice ejectment is not confined to forfeitures claimed by reason of nonpayment of rent. Canfield v. Hall, 121 Vt. 479, 160 A.2d 768 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        Justice ejectment gives summary remedy to persons entitled to possession which is wrongfully withheld, and is intended as substitute for technical procedure of common law action of ejectment. Canfield v. Hall, 121 Vt. 52, 147 A.2d 886 (1959); Canfield v. Hall, 121 Vt. 479, 160 A.2d 768 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        Justice ejectment provides summary remedy for a landlord whose tenant holds over without right after determination of lease; it lies where common law ejectment would lie and is given for wrongful holding over of demised premises, and thus has all characteristics of ejectment. Sabourin v. Woish, 116 Vt. 385, 78 A.2d 333 (1950); LaFleur v. Smith, 95 Vt. 476, 115 A. 729 (1921); Foss v. Stanton, 76 Vt. 365, 57 A. 942 (1903); Hadley v. Havens, 24 Vt. 520 (1852).
       </p>
       <p>
        All provisions creating and allowing justice ejectment proceed on supposition that lease is at an end, and remedy lies only when lessee holds without right after determination of lease. Sabourin v. Woish, 116 Vt. 385, 78 A.2d 333 (1950); Mead v. Owen, 80 Vt. 273, 67 A. 722 (1907), same case 83 Vt. 132, 74 A. 1058.

       </h5>
       <p>
        This section permits securing of justice writ of possession by one taking an original lessor against one claiming possession under an original lessee. Crawford v. Jerry, 111 Vt. 120, 11 A.2d 210 (1940); Trask v. Fountain, 93 Vt. 83, 106 A. 559 (1918); Barton v. Learned, 26 Vt. 192 (1854); President of Middlebury College v. Lawton, 23 Vt. 688 (1851).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since justice ejectment is statutory in nature, right to maintain it depends on showing facts which bring case within terms of statute. Hinsman v. Marble Sav. Bank, 102 Vt. 217, 147 A. 270 (1929), same case 100 Vt. 48, 134 A. 635, 104 Vt. 40, 156 A. 874; Wheeler v. Wheeler, 77 Vt. 177, 59 A. 842 (1904); Pitkin v. Burch, 48 Vt. 521 (1875).

        Action under this section did not lie in favor of vendors against vendees who had defaulted on payments under a contract for deed, and the default did not change the relationship to that of landlord and tenant. Strengowski v. Gomes, 128 Vt. 555, 268 A.2d 749 (1970).
       </p>

        Where the tenancy had not been terminated on the date that the landlord brought the ejectment action, the trial court should have entered judgment for tenant. Further, because the damages action was derivative of the ejectment action, the damages aspect of the judgment also could not be sustained. Andrus v. Dunbar, 178 Vt. 554, 878 A.2d 245 (mem.) (April 13, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        A prerequisite to bringing an action under this statute is the existence of a landlord and tenant relationship, and the action does not lie against one in the possession of lands or tenements unless they are held by a technical lessee and all his title and right therein, both legal and equitable, has terminated. Strengowski v. Gomes, 128 Vt. 555, 268 A.2d 749 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section applies only to cases wherein technical relation of landlord and tenant exists and without this remedy provided is not available. Crawford v. Jerry, 111 Vt. 120, 11 A.2d 210 (1940); Trask v. Fountain, 93 Vt. 83, 106 A. 559 (1918); Mead v. Owen, 80 Vt. 273, 67 A. 722 (1907), same case 83 Vt. 132, 74 A. 1058; Wheeler v.

       <p>
        Where defendant was not tenant of plaintiff in his occupancy of house and such occupancy was mere incident to operation of farm on shares, in respect of which relation of landlord and tenant did not exist, action would not lie to recover possession of house.

        Where in action of justice ejectment to recover possession of house, defense was that defendant was trying to effect settlement and was to vacate when settlement was made, evidence by defendant's wife that she heard him say that he was willing to move if he could get a satisfactory settlement, was not within provision of

        In an action of "justice ejectment," when plaintiff testified that defendant was in possession of farm in question under an oral contract that if he would live with her thereon and do by her as a son ought, he should have what was on place and should have home with her as long as she lived; regardless of whether this made defendant lessee of farm, and notwithstanding statute of frauds, he had the right to meet this testimony by showing that he was in possession under an oral agreement such that he was not lessee of the premises.

        Statute regarding a tenant's abandoned property is not made obsolete; it has continued viability in situations where a residential tenant abandons or vacates a dwelling unit without being formally evicted, and the statute governing a tenant's property remaining on the premises after an eviction applies in circumstances where the abandonment statute does not.

        Because 15 days from service of the writ of possession had passed when the sheriff came to execute the writ, the landlord was entitled to dispose of any personal property of the tenants without liability and was not required to return the property to the tenants.

       <p>
        Statute governing a tenant's property remaining on the premises after an eviction plainly allows a landlord to dispose of property, and, therefore, does not place an affirmative obligation on the landlord to store or keep any items left in a dwelling unit after fifteen days from when the writ of possession is served.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Court cannot read the statute governing a tenant's property remaining on the premises after an eviction as giving the landlord the value of the personal property found on the premises at the end of the statutory period. The landlord may incur no liability for the act of disposing of the property, but this does not mean that the landlord can be enriched by the value of the property in cases where the property does have value; any benefit the landlord realizes from the sale or retention of the personal property is subject to a claim of unjust enrichment.

         1. Forcible entry.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where person enters unoccupied house in the night without force or violence, it constitutes mere trespass, not forcible entry. Foster v. Kelsey, 36 Vt. 199 (1863).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that defendant was in possession of plaintiff's field and forcibly prevented him from putting his cattle into the field, and thus compelled him to quit possession, would, if uncontradicted, prove forcible detainer. Foster v. Kelsey, 36 Vt. 199 (1863).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unlawful but peaceable entry, followed by forcible detainer, is held to come within meaning and cognizance of the statutes upon forcible entry and detainer; even if without a previous demand in writing. Foster v. Kelsey, 36 Vt. 199 (1863).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where one has the right to enter and take possession of premises in occupancy of another, his entry will be legal and not forcible entry and detainer, if made while other party is temporarily absent from premises, leaving no one there, even though it be necessary to force door to gain admittance. Mussey v. Scott, 32 Vt. 82 (1859).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where tenant entered farm under a lease for a year, with stipulations that he would perform certain acts, breach of these stipulations did not entitle lessor to action for forcible entry and detainer before expiration of the year. Ramo v. Wilson, 24 Vt. 520 (1852).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where tenant at will of a dwelling house held over his term and after due notice to quit, the landlord forcibly entered and ejected him, his family and effects, from the house, the entry was unlawful, and the tenant recovered his damages therefor - and it made no difference that the tenant had agreed to leave by a certain day named and that, if he did not leave, the landlord might put out him and his effects in any way he chose. Dustin v. Cowdry, 23 Vt. 631 (1851).

       <p>
        Title and right of possession of dwelling house does not justify an entry and forcible expulsion of occupant and his family wrongfully holding over. Carpenter v. Barber, 44 Vt. 441 (1872).
       </p>
       <p>
        For party to justify entry with violence upon premises in which he has title, on ground of previous peaceable entry, it must appear that party took actual peaceable possession on prior occasion, which was unabandoned down to time of his assertion of his right of entry with violence, so that in what was done at that time he stood in the attitude of defending his premises, and not of invading the occupant's possession by force.

         4. Pleading.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where declaration, in addition to averments of breaking and entering plaintiff's close, contains allegations of other matters, such as expulsion of plaintiff from premises, or taking and carrying away of personal property, leaving it equivocal whether plaintiff intends such additional matter as aggravation of principal trespass, or whether it was inserted as distinct trespass for which plaintiff seeks to recover, defendant has right to regard it as aggravation merely, and in his plea pass over it in silence, answering only alleged trespass on freehold. Carpenter v. Barber, 44 Vt. 441 (1872).
       </p>
       <p>
        In such case, under common low pleading, if defendant so pleads, and his plea is good answer to alleged trespass on freehold, it is prima facie an answer to whole action, and if plaintiff wishes to avoid this effect and recover for such additional trespass, as well as for trespass on freehold, he must new assign in respect to such additional trespass, and allege in his new assignment that he brought his action as well for trespass mentioned in plea, as for trespasses newly assigned; but it is not necessary to new assign where plea attempts to justify all trespasses or grounds of action specifically, for which plaintiff proceeds. Carpenter v. Barber, 44 Vt. 441 (1872).

        When appellant's bid was relatively low, the foreclosure judgment lacked an explicit in-person bidding requirement, and there was significant uncertainty as to the status of the bank's competing virtual bid, the trial court was presented with sufficient evidence to create reasonable apprehension and concern surrounding the integrity of the first sale. Thus, its decision to refuse to confirm the first sale and to order a second sale with the in-person bidding requirement explicitly stated was not an abuse of discretion. HSBC Bank USA N.A. v. McAllister, 206 Vt. 445, 182 A.3d 593 (Jan. 19, 2018).

        High bidder's successful bid in a judicial sale and the court's subsequent confirmation of the foreclosure sale renders a buyer a limited party such that the court is authorized to issue orders directing the buyer's action relative to the property's purchase. Thus, the trial court had the authority to order the buyer to act. People's United Bank, NA v. Alana Provencale, Inc., 207 Vt. 362, 189 A.3d 71 (Apr. 27, 2018).

       <p>
        Liability imposed by the statute regarding judgments obtained against a partnership, association or company is not liability for the original wrongdoing, but liability for the debt. The statutory scheme charges individuals who join unincorporated associations with knowledge that they are agreeing to a certain form of contractual liability for collective debts; if a member of the association was simply ignorant of this law, such ignorance is not an excuse. Daniels v. Elks Club of Hartford, 192 Vt. 114, 58 A.3d 925 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Absent the corporate shield on liability, the statute regarding judgments obtained against a partnership, association or company permitted the creditors of a club which had operated as a voluntary association following involuntary dissolution to collect from individuals who were members when the various aspects of the judgment against the club arose if collection from the club itself was not possible. Daniels v. Elks Club of Hartford, 192 Vt. 114, 58 A.3d 925 (2012).

        Court interprets the word "threaten" in the civil stalking statute to refer to threats of physical harm. The court reaches this conclusion for three reasons; first, by specifically excluding constitutional activity from the prohibited conduct, the statute is implicitly limited to "true threats"; second, this interpretation is consistent with the court's previous case law relating to threats; and third, to the extent that the definition of "threat" is ambiguous, the rule of lenity requires the court to resolve the ambiguity in favor of the defendant. Hinkson v. Stevens, - Vt.
    - , 239 A.3d 212 (2020).
       </p>

        To the extent the same definitions apply in both civil and criminal contexts, the Court interprets the civil stalking statute in accordance with the rule of lenity normally applied to criminal statutes. Hinkson v. Stevens, - Vt.

        Defendant's conduct, which stemmed from a sexual encounter plaintiff's husband had with defendant's romantic partner, did not constitute stalking under the civil stalking statute in that defendant's emails, shipments of books concerning rape, and phone calls were not part of a course of conduct, as defendant's repeated masked calls to plaintiff's cell phone did not constitute monitoring or threats, and his shipments of books and emails, while they could reasonably be construed as threatening social retribution against plaintiff and her husband based on the husband's alleged sexual misconduct, were not threats of physical harm.

        Because the statute governing requests for orders against stalking or sexual assault (SSA) does not require defendants in SSA protection-order cases to be adults, the trial court erred in reading such a limitation into the statute and thereby dismissing a complaint for an order of protection brought by a 17-year-old against a 13-year-old without reaching the merits.

        In a partition case, while an accounting of what portion of contributions the plaintiff and the defendant each made to taxes, insurance, utilities, repairs and the like need not be precise, a ballpark estimate is insufficient; the party with the burden of proof on a particular claim of contribution or offset must bear the risk of failing to prove the necessary financial facts. Nor should the court's evaluation of contribution claims be conflated with its consideration of offsets. Assessment of offsets cannot be evaluated by the trial court or an appellate court without knowing at least the general proportion of each party's contribution to maintaining and preserving the property in the first place. Whippie v. O'Connor, 187 Vt. 523, 996 A.2d 1154 (2010).

       <p>
        To sustain petition for partition, petitioner must have some greater present interest in premises than mere right of entry. Brock v. Eastman, 28 Vt. 658 (1856), same case 27 Vt. 559.

       <p>
        It is not necessary that petitioner should be in actual possession of premises at time of bringing petition, provided he has not been disseised; and for this purpose distinction is recognized between mere possession of plaintiff's share of premises by third person, or by defendant, and legal disseisin.

       </h5>
       <p>
        In a partition action, the findings were insufficient to rebut the presumption that the joint title established plaintiff's intent to convey a present interest in the property to defendant. The finding that plaintiff did not intend to give defendant an outright gift of any interest in the property was contrary to the finding that he intentionally placed her name on the deed and the finding that he was cautious in titling property jointly; it was impossible to reconcile the finding that plaintiff simply assumed that defendant would sign over the property upon their estrangement with the finding that he was extremely conservative with putting names on property or with the finding that he intentionally did not put defendant's name on any Connecticut deeds; the finding that the parties were joint owners was irreconcilable with the finding that plaintiff did not intend to give defendant an outright gift; and the finding that plaintiff had a will that named defendant as a beneficiary with respect to property other than the house, and that he canceled that will upon their breakup, could not be reconciled with the trial court's finding that as to the house, he intended to accomplish by mere silence what he had taken pains to accomplish with full written formalities as to other property. Massey v. Hrostek, 186 Vt. 211, 980 A.2d 768 (2009), overruled in part as stated in Whippie v. O'Connor, 2011 VT 97, 190 Vt. 600, 30 A.3d 1292.
       </p>
       <p>
        Severance in which plaintiff quitclaimed his interest to a trustee who reconveyed it to him, severing the joint tenancy and converting it to a tenancy in common, was not material to the court's decision in a partition action because it did not affect the size of the parties' respective shares in the property, and did not prevent the trial court from entertaining the partition action. Massey v. Hrostek, 186 Vt. 211, 980 A.2d 768 (2009), overruled in part as stated in Whippie v. O'Connor, 2011 VT 97, 190 Vt. 600, 30 A.3d 1292.
       </p>
       <p>
        While plaintiff was entitled to partition under this section only upon acquiring her joint tenancy in the property, once she brought the partition action, the court was within its right to consider her prior financial contributions to the property in an effort to equitably divide the parties' interests. Begin v. Benoit, 181 Vt. 553, 915 A.2d 786 (mem.) (December 6, 2006).

        As the statutory provisions relating to partition undertake to deal with common ownership which involves survivorship, the existence of a joint tenancy alone will not forestall its operation. Coolidge v. Coolidge, 130 Vt. 132, 287 A.2d 566 (1972).

        Where judgment order granting divorce awarded real estate to the parties as tenants in common subject only to husband's right to occupy residence on the property as long as it was his principal place of dwelling, as a tenant in common, wife had a right to partition of the property, a right which was neither waived by earlier agreement nor barred by the divorce order.

       </p>
       <p>
        Claim for partition exists whenever there is a tenancy in common and is a continuing right, and statute of limitations, as to the claim, runs only against a tenant who has been excluded from possession and begins to run as of the time of exclusion.

        Where parties stipulated to partition, one could not later, on appeal, raise claim that although statute of limitations was an affirmative defense required to be pleaded, and was not pleaded in the case, the matter was raised on argument and not objected to, thereby putting the statute in issue, for the stipulation was a clear waiver of any claim under the statute.

        Trial court appropriately considered the parties' debt related to the refinancing of the home, including credit card debts paid off through additional mortgages, because debt incurred on the home, the subject of partition, was relevant to determining the equities. On the other hand, the court inappropriately considered defendant's child-support arrears. Begin v. Benoit, 181 Vt. 553, 915 A.2d 786 (mem.) (December 6, 2006).

        In a partition action, the trial court was incorrect to recognize an additional offset in plaintiff's favor based on her income being necessary to obtain the financing to purchase the property. The fact that plaintiff applied for and was a necessary cosigner with defendant on the mortgage application for financing might support the presumption that she owned an undivided one-half interest in the property, but lent nothing to her claim for additional equitable consideration; plaintiff neither contributed more, nor had more at risk, than defendant based on the bare fact that she applied for and was obliged on the mortgage to the same degree as defendant. Whippie v. O'Connor, 187 Vt. 523, 996 A.2d 1154 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff's purchases for the parties' children and payments to general expenses were not relevant to partition, and the trial court's consideration of those factors was error; the trial court did not find that plaintiff's expenditures on behalf of the children and payment of other expenses were an agreed-upon substitute for paying her share of the housing costs. Crediting to plaintiff's account for her contributions to general domestic expenses was beyond the scope of the partition statute. Whippie v. O'Connor, 187 Vt. 523, 996 A.2d 1154 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a partition action, plaintiff should have received no credit for the cost of telephone service or the cost of television, as those costs were not necessary to maintain the property. If lock and alarm costs were incurred in order to oust defendant, who was entitled to an undivided one-half interest in the property, they were plainly not to be credited to plaintiff. Massey v. Hrostek, 186 Vt. 211, 980 A.2d 768 (2009), overruled in part as stated in Whippie v. O'Connor, 2011 VT 97, 190 Vt. 600, 30 A.3d 1292.

       <p>
        In a partition action, there was no showing that defendant consented to the construction of hiking trails or a shooting berm. Thus, plaintiff should be credited only for the increase those improvements caused in fair market value, not for the $23,000 cost. Massey v. Hrostek, 186 Vt. 211, 980 A.2d 768 (2009), overruled in part as stated in Whippie v. O'Connor, 2011 VT 97, 190 Vt. 600, 30 A.3d 1292.

       <p>
        Plaintiff changed the locks and security codes on the parties' property in early November 2003, and defendant had not had access to the property since that date. Thus defendant in a partition action was entitled to a setoff for one-half of the rental value of the property for the period during which she was denied access to the property. Massey v. Hrostek, 186 Vt. 211, 980 A.2d 768 (2009), overruled in part as stated in Whippie v. O'Connor, 2011 VT 97, 190 Vt. 600, 30 A.3d 1292.

        It was undisputed in a partition action that plaintiff paid all of the necessary maintenance and repair expenses to the parties' property, as well as certain pre-ouster improvement costs. Defendant's interest therefore had to be reduced by an amount equal to one-half of the necessary repair and maintenance costs incurred before the ouster. Massey v.

        In a partition action, given that the house construction was, according to defendant's own testifying appraiser, thirty-seven percent complete at the time of the transfer to the parties' joint tenancy, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in considering defendant's initial investment in the property rather than its value at the time of transfer in conducting its equitable analysis.

       </p>
       <p>
        In a partition action, the trial court's findings with respect to the parties' respective contributions were supported by sufficient evidence in the record. The parties stipulated to much of the evidence underlying plaintiff's figures; a certain loan was not included in plaintiff's contribution; and although siding purchased by plaintiff's parents had not been installed at the time of suit, it was on site and ready to go on the house.

        All, or virtually all, decisions that have considered the question have held that partition is available for leasehold interests. Thus, plaintiff could seek partition of leasehold property under the partition statute. Wynkoop v. Stratthaus, 201 Vt. 158, 136 A.3d 1180 (2016).

        Where commissioners in a partition proceeding did not follow directions of the trial court not to engage in ex parte contacts without stipulation of the parties and to give notice and an opportunity to be present for the taking of any evidence, and to hold a meeting with all parties present, but, rather than taking evidence, undertook their own independent investigation of the facts and failed to create and submit a record of their investigation, the court erred in its conclusion that it was plaintiff's burden to demonstrate, via examination of the commissioners themselves, that the findings were clearly erroneous and, given the complete lack of a record, the court should have conducted a de novo hearing.

        If on trial of petition for partition it appears that parties are tenants in common of only part of premises described in petition, court will proceed to make partition, assignment or sale, as case may require of that part. Baldwin v. Aldrich, 34 Vt. 526 (1861).

         2. Costs.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        There was no basis to award defendant costs in a partition action. The trial court's finding that the parties originally acquired the property as equals was consistent with the presumption, not rebutted, that tenants in common had equal title in the commonly owned property; that plaintiff might realize less than the full value of her undivided one-half interest resulted from equitable adjustments by the trial court pursuant to the partition action after title was acquired. Whippie v. O'Connor, 187 Vt. 523, 996 A.2d 1154 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Costs in partition cases can only be allowed in county court; and if no order is made in that court as to costs, none will be in Supreme Court; thus, motion in Supreme Court to have cause heard at former term brought forward and costs allowed was dismissed.

        Partition in kind is favored over partition by sale, but where the statutory requirements of a partition by sale are met, a sale becomes a matter of right. Taran v. Vermont Structural Slate Co., Inc., 139 Vt. 441, 431 A.2d 448 (1981).

       <p>
        Test of whether partition shall be made by sale, under this section, is "great inconvenience" of owners, essential consideration being pecuniary welfare of owners, and sale will not be ordered until it is shown to be for best interests of all owners, to determine which test is whether value of share of each owner in case of partition would be materially less than his share of money equivalent that can probably be obtained for whole. Blanchard v. Cross, 97 Vt. 370, 123 A. 382 (1924).

       <p>
        When real estate held in common cannot be divided without great inconvenience to the parties interested, fact that plaintiff is not hindered in enjoyment of his share of rents and profits of premises furnished no ground why court, upon proper petition to that effect, should refuse to order assignment of whole to one party sale for benefit of all of them.

        In proceeding under this chapter, if commissioners find that property cannot be divided without great inconvenience, they should ascertain and report to court whether one of the owners is willing to take assignment of interest of other owner or owners, and sum or sums that are equitable compensation for assignment, as well as times and manner of payment; unless cause to contrary is shown report is to be accepted by court and judgment rendered for assignment to the party indicated therein; commissioners then proceed with the actual assignment.

        In a partition action, the trial court properly assigned the property to plaintiff. It reasonably considered her greater contribution to financing, organizing, and facilitating the construction process, as well as her family's quite substantial contributions of labor and money; furthermore, as she had been pre-approved for a loan, the trial court did not err in finding that she had a likely superior capacity to finance a prompt payment for defendant's interest, while absorbing responsibility for the debt to her parents. Nystrom v. Hafford, 192 Vt. 300, 59 A.3d 736 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont statutory scheme allows for assignment even when more than one co-tenant is willing to accept it, and gives the trial court discretion over whether to order an assignment and the choice of assignee. Wilk v. Wilk, 173 Vt. 343, 795 A.2d 1191 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        In partition action involving a one-acre parcel on which plaintiff operated a paving business out of the buildings thereon, and defendant - plaintiff's brother - operated a junk yard on an adjoining parcel of land, where both parties acquired a one-eighth interest in the property by inheritance, and plaintiff subsequently purchased the interests of other siblings, the trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering defendant to assign his interest to plaintiff where it found that: plaintiff was conducting an active, viable business; he had expended considerable sums to construct an office for his business; he had maintained the property in a reasonable and neat manner, while defendant's use of his own adjoining property, as well as the property at issue was in violation of local zoning regulations; and that the potential loss of use of a driveway across the property would not prejudice defendant because his adjoining parcel had substantial road frontage from which the property could be accessed. Wilk v. Wilk, 173 Vt. 343, 795 A.2d 1191 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        In partition proceeding in which plaintiffs and defendant each owned a half interest in the property and wanted to purchase it, trial court correctly ruled that statutory public sale, with appropriate division of the net proceeds, be held, and that each party was authorized to bid, and court did not have to determine and order assignment of the property to one of the parties on terms established as equitable by the duly appointed commissioners. Weenolsen v. Kamber, 137 Vt. 540, 409 A.2d 577 (1979).

        Where judgment of county court has been affirmed by Supreme Court, on exceptions, petitionee's costs may be taxed after court adjourns, as in other cases. Strong v. Hobbs, 20 Vt. 192 (1848).
       </p>
       <p>
        All costs which accrued in consequence of trial of any facts alleged in petition, to which petitionees interposed plea of denial, and upon which petitioner prevailed, are properly taxable in favor of petitioner; although in practice costs in regard to trial have only been taxed when title in the land, in some way, came in dispute between parties.

        In scire facias on sheriff's official recognizance, previous judgment against sheriff is conclusive of the plaintiff's right to a judgment against sheriff and his bail, as against all defenses which sheriff might have urged in opposition to the suit against him alone, except when judgment was rendered against sheriff by default. Bradley v. Chamberlin, 35 Vt. 277 (1862).

     </h3>
     <p>
      When a person liable as sheriff or high bailiff for official misconduct, neglect, or default has removed from the State leaving no known attachable property therein, so that service of process cannot be made upon him or her, an action founded in contract may be brought directly upon the recognizance or bond of the sheriff or high bailiff and his or her sureties by the party entitled thereto, without first bringing suit against the sheriff or high bailiff.
    In the action, the sureties may make any defense which their principal might have made if the action had been against him or her directly for the misconduct, neglect, or default.

        This section is to be construed literally as to time when action may be brought, and the right of action exists whenever the liability of the sheriff and inability to serve process upon him concur. Hine v. Pomeroy, 40 Vt. 103 (1868), same case 39 Vt. 211.

        A motion pursuant to V.R.Cr.P. 41(e), governing the return of property allegedly seized in violation of law, is essentially a replevin action that lies exclusively against the State, and it is well settled that a party demanding possession cannot maintain a replevin action against a defendant who, at the time the action is instituted, is not in possession of or cannot exercise control over the property sought.

        Right to maintain replevin for goods did not exist at common law, but is conferred by statute, and must therefore be exercised under restrictions which statute has imposed. Prescott v. Starkey, 71 Vt. 118, 41 A. 1021 (1898).

        Taking and detention are two vital issues in action of replevin under this section and judgment on action must dispose of both of them. Patch v. Lathrop, 116 Vt. 151, 70 A.2d 605 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mortgagee, to maintain replevin for property to which he holds title by chattel mortgage, against officer who has taken same in execution against mortgagor, must show that such officer has unlawfully taken or detained the property; that is, that he holds it in a way inconsistent with the statutes permitting attachment and sale of mortgagor's interest; it is not enough that he has levied upon and advertised it for sale. National Bank v. Miller, 67 Vt. 66, 30 A. 700 (1894).
       </p>
       <p>
        One lawfully in possession and use of article does not subject himself to action of replevin under this section for unlawful detention by continuing to use article without reply after receiving letter from owner demanding it. Dearing & Co. v. Smith, 66 Vt. 60, 28 A. 630 (1893).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where husband and wife together owned a farm and wife entrusted entire management to her husband, who leased it, reserving a lien on increase of stock to secure performance of conditions of lease, such increase cannot be attached upon debts of tenants, and husband may in his own name replevy it from officer who has so attached it. Pelton v. Draper, 61 Vt. 364, 17 A. 494 (1889).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where divorced wife, who had been assigned their dwelling as her separate property, refused to let her husband enter the house, but offered to put out any property he had in the house, there was no taking or detaining that would sustain replevin by the husband. Bent v. Bent, 44 Vt. 633 (1872), same case 43 Vt. 42.
       </p>
       <p>
        Where common carrier was liable to owner of goods for damage caused by fault of carrier in their transportation, to an amount larger than carrier's charge for freight, and carrier refused to deliver them until the freight charge was paid, the detention was unlawful as the carrier's lien was only co-extensive with the right to claim and recover freight. Dyer v. Grand Trunk Ry., 42 Vt. 441 (1869).

       <p>
        Owner of beasts unjustly detained by poundkeeper may have replevin against him for the beasts, under this section, but such claim must rest wholly upon wrongful act of poundkeeper. Mellen v. Moody, 23 Vt. 674 (1851).

        Replevy of liquor seized on complaint and warrant as intoxicating is of that class of replevin provided for in this section; and a bond like that required in replevin by a defendant, of goods attached on mesne process, is not proper in such cases.

        Writ of replevin is a writ of summons, not attachment, and service upon defendant must conform to the provisions of statute as to the service of writs of summons, and delivery of copy to agent of defendant, latter being out of the State, is not sufficient.

        Verdict in replevin that defendant is guilty and judgment thereon, without mention of damages or costs, establishes plaintiff's right of possession, defendant's wrongful taking and detention and, by consequence, plaintiff's right to at least nominal damages; and clerk is justified in issuing an execution for such damages and costs and if damages be omitted, the execution will not for that reason be set aside on audita querela.

      The writ in an action of replevin commenced under the provisions of section 5321 or 5331 of this title shall not be issued until the plaintiff or someone in his or her behalf executes and delivers to the officer a bond to the defendant, with sufficient surety to be approved by the court, in a penalty double the value of the property to be replevied, with condition to prosecute the action to final judgment and pay such damages and costs as the defendant recovers against him or her, and also to return the property if that is the final judgment.

        5331 of this title and a bond like that required in replevin by a defendant, of goods attached on mesne process, is not proper in such cases. H.K. Thurber & Co. v. Richmond, 46 Vt. 395 (1874).

        In action to replevy goods alleged to be unlawfully taken or detained, if bond given to the officer for defendant upon service of writ does not contain penalty in a definite sum, but merely states it as "double the value of the goods to be replevied" in suit in question, action will be dismissed upon a motion made at proper stage of case.

        Officer may commence service of replevin writ by taking possession of property, for purposes of appraisal, before taking bond required under this section and delivering property to plaintiff. Hill v. Scott, 101 Vt. 356, 143 A. 276 (1928), overruled on other grounds, Duchaine v. Zaetz (1945) 114 Vt. 274, 44 A.2d 165; McKinstry v.

       <p>
        Where officer justifies under writ of replevin against plaintiff, and it is claimed by plaintiff that the officer delivered the property to the plaintiff in replevin suit before taking the bond required by this section, the law presumes the contrary, and it is error for court to refuse to so instruct the jury. McKinstry v. Collins, 76 Vt. 221, 56 A. 985 (1903), same case 74 Vt. 147, 52 A. 438.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Defendant in replevin suit cannot maintain action against officer for not taking sufficient bond, if he has impaired value of bond to officer, as by discharging a surety, for officer is entitled to benefit of bond. Follett v. Shumway, 68 Vt. 68, 33 A. 1067 (1895).
       </p>
       <p>
        Officer has immunity for acts done in the execution of legal process, but where court has no jurisdiction over the subject matter, the process gives no protection to the officer executing it. Driscoll v. Place, 44 Vt. 252 (1872).
       </p>
       <p>
        Officer who serves replevin writ in behalf of defendant to recover possession of property attached is bound to take sureties on replevin bond who are at time actually responsible for its amount; it not being enough that they are, at time bond is taken, in good credit and apparently responsible; but he is not liable if, being actually responsible when taken, they cease to be so before bond is put in suit.

       <p>
        In suit on replevin bond conditioned to pay damages and costs recovered in replevin suit, and for return of property, the only damages recoverable are those assessed in the replevin suit. Miltimore v. Bottom, 66 Vt. 168, 28 A. 872 (1894).
       </p>
       <p>
        If defendant has failed to return property replevied in accordance with judgment in replevin suit, plaintiff may also recover damages for that breach of condition of the bond. Miltimore v. Bottom, 66 Vt. 168, 28 A. 872 (1894).
       </p>
       <p>
        If evidence clearly tends to show that damages of plaintiff are in excess of penalty of bond, and defendant waives right to go to jury, court may direct a verdict for plaintiff for the penalty. Miltimore v. Bottom, 66 Vt. 168, 28 A. 872 (1894).

        It is error for county court to render judgment for return of property replevied in an action of which it has no jurisdiction. Widber v. Benjamin, 75 Vt. 152, 53 A. 1071 (1902).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where replevin action was dismissed for improper venue, court nevertheless had power to order property returned to defendant without any proof of his right of ownership, and plaintiff had no right to contest this order on the ground that he owned the property involved. Collamer v. Page, 35 Vt. 387 (1862).

       <p>
        Where writ did not require officer to take bond conditioned for return of property, as well as for prosecution of replevin to effect and payment of costs and damages, and bond returned was signed by plaintiffs only, these irregularities did not make proceedings so void that court had no jurisdiction of parties and of subject matter of suit, and that defendant waived them by omitting to take advantage thereof within the time limited for filing dilatory pleas, and, also, by pleading to merits.

        When, in an action against officer for assault upon plaintiff's wife, defendant attempts to justify under a writ of replevin against the plaintiff, the return thereon is prima facie evidence in favor of defendant, but it is open to contradiction by plaintiff upon the question whether officer delivered property to plaintiff in the replevin suit before taking the bond required by this section.

      Upon the abatement, dismissal, nonsuit, default, or trial of an action of replevin, the court shall make such order for the return or restoration of the goods as is just, and may take such inquest of damages in the premises as the rights of the parties require, and render judgment thereon accordingly. When such replevin terminates otherwise than upon the merits, such court may make such special order as to the return or restoration of the goods or as to damages, and may require such security in the premises, from either party, as is just.

         1. Judgment.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Judgment order under this section should determine the rights of the parties on the primary statutory issues. Patch v. Lathrop, 116 Vt. 151, 70 A.2d 605 (1949).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is for the court to make such order and render such judgment in respect to a return as the facts found require, and when a verdict of not guilty does not involve a finding of the requisite facts, they may well be found specially by the jury. James Smith Woolen Mach. Co. v. Holden, 73 Vt. 396, 51 A. 2 (1901).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where goods are held under a replevin action which has been dismissed, they must be returned to owner as a matter of right. Crosby v. Cook, 122 Vt. 175, 167 A.2d 87 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order for return of property involved was justified under provisions of this section, since one haled into court on a void writ of replevin should be restored to the advantage which the possession of the disputed property gave him. Ramsey v. McDonald, 108 Vt. 180, 184 A. 691 (1936).
       </p>
       <p>
        Verdict of not guilty determines that there was no unlawful detention by defendant of the goods replevied, but does not necessarily determine question of their return, that depending upon right of possession. James Smith Woolen Mach. Co. v. Holden, 73 Vt. 396, 51 A. 2 (1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        In replevin for liquor seized where action was dismissed for want of proper replevin bond, defendant was entitled to a judgment for a return of the property, with damages for the taking thereof by the replevin, and to an order that the replevying officer return the property to the defendant, at the place whence he took it. H.K. Thurber & Co. v. Richmond, 46 Vt. 395 (1874).

        Where articles replevied were one safe, two hogs, and thirty-four gross bottles and verdict was, "that the defendant is not guilty in manner and form, as the plaintiff in his declaration hath alleged and for the return to the defendant of two hogs and thirty-four gross bottles, named in the writ, and to recover of plaintiff one cent damages, and his costs," the first paragraph of the verdict was all that was necessary under the general issue, and the court should adapt the judgment to the rights proved.

        Vermont opinion, followed twice without reexamination, holding a man could bring loss of consortium action at common law but rejecting the claim that a woman could, on ground that since the law recognized no corresponding right in children there was no reason to extend the availability of the action beyond the boundaries of an "outworn common-law cause of action" merely for the sake of consistency unless some distinctive characteristic of the wife's status is shown to distinguish it from others, showed Supreme Court has heretofore declined to recognize a woman's right of action for loss of consortium at common law, but has not foreclosed such recognition. Whitney v. Fisher, 138 Vt. 468, 417 A.2d 934 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial established principle, precedent and policy compelled Supreme Court to reconsider common law Vermont rule that men, but not women, could bring a loss of consortium action, and since the action is for the remedy of injuries sustained by one who has been deprived of affection, aid and cooperation in conjugal relations, society and support, it is difficult to find any non-arbitrary distinction between the interests of the man and woman in their mutual society, and if there is a distinction it is wholly irrelevant to availability of a right of action against those who interfere with that society, as the society requires the mutual participation of both spouses; as no state of facts may reasonably be conceived to justify the rule denying a woman an action for loss of consortium while allowing a man to bring such an action, the action would be allowed woman in instant case, and prior cases supporting the rule denying a woman the action would be overruled.

       <p>
        The purpose of Vermont's small claims court is to provide a simple, informal and inexpensive procedure for determining civil actions where the amount in controversy is no more than $3500; hearings without juries are conducted in a summary manner, examination of witnesses is done primarily by the judge, the Rules of Evidence and many of the civil rules do not apply, and much of the hearing and prehearing procedure is intended to encourage appearance without lawyers by preventing unfair imposition on a pro se litigant.

        Both the Superior Court and the District Court have subject matter jurisdiction over civil actions up to the jurisdictional amount of subsection (a) of this section; the variation between the two courts is the procedure available, actions in the Superior Court being governed by the "formal procedure" of the Vermont Rules of Civil Procedure, while actions in the District Court may be brought under the "simple, informal and inexpensive procedure" reflected in the District Court Civil Rules.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Since litigants in small claims actions are encouraged to appear pro se, and a great majority of them are untrained in the law, the proceedings are to be as simple and untechnical as possible. Ferris-Prabhu v. Dave & Son, Inc., 142 Vt. 479, 457 A.2d 631 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Supreme Court will not permit unfair imposition or unconscionable advantage to be taken of one who acts as his own attorney, especially in small claims actions where self-representation is encouraged. Ferris-Prabhu v. Dave & Son, Inc., 142 Vt. 479, 457 A.2d 631 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a small claims action for breach of a construction contract, dismissed for failure to prove damages, in which plaintiff appeared pro se, where the court found defendant liable but failed to allow plaintiff to elaborate on the basis for his claimed damage figure, failed to advise plaintiff of the commonly used procedures for proving damages or to examine him in such a way as to facilitate proof, and did not explain the meaning of defense counsel's repeated objections, plaintiff was so disadvantaged that the cause would be remanded for further hearing on plaintiff's damage claim.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The purpose of small claims courts is to avoid complicated procedural rules, delays and expensive legal costs and to provide a simple, efficient, informal and inexpensive means for adjudicating disputes involving relatively small amounts of money, a purpose which would be frustrated if small claims were forced into Superior Court after the filing of permissive counterclaims demanding more than the jurisdictional limit of subsection (a) of this section; therefore, a small claims case may not be transferred from a District Court to a Superior Court.

       <p>
        The legislative mandate in subsection (a) of this section, requiring the Supreme Court to make rules providing for a simple, informal and inexpensive procedure for the determination of small claims cases, requires that, under D.C.C.R. 80.3, governing small claims procedures, D.C.C.R. 13, providing for filing of permissive counterclaims, is applicable only up to the jurisdictional limit of subsection (a) of this section.

        Where defendant, duly notified, failed to attend small claims hearing and judgment was entered for plaintiff, and defendant thereafter appealed to Supreme Court but did not appear personally and instead sent two letters stating his grounds for appeal as being (1) his inexperience and lack of a lawyer, (2) lack of help from the court, (3) the distance and inconvenience of getting to court, (4) that he did not have his day in court, and (5) possible prejudice on the part of the court, defendant demonstrated no legal or factual basis upon which relief could be granted.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Small claims court's use of contempt power was premature and based on an insufficient foundation, where court failed to establish that defendant had any reachable assets not jointly owned, and court's finding that defendant had present ability to pay was therefore unsupported by the evidence and clearly erroneous. Hale v. Peddle, 160 Vt. 621, 648 A.2d 830 (mem.) (1993).

The Administrative Judge shall assign the appeal to a Superior judge who shall not have participated in any way in the decision being appealed. The appeal shall be heard and decided, based on the record made in the small claims procedure. No appeal as of right exists to the Supreme Court.

        Private child placement agencies have a duty to report any suspected or alleged incident of child abuse or neglect that gives rise to an action against an agency where a plaintiff establishes the factual elements of negligence; consequently, there exists pursuant to this chapter a comparable cause of action where a complaint alleges negligence against a State agency in placing children in foster homes. LaShay v. Department of Social & Rehabilitation Services, 160 Vt. 60, 625 A.2d 224 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Governmental liability under this chapter may arise only if a plaintiff's cause of action is comparable to a cause of action against a private citizen and the allegations, taken as true, will satisfy the necessary elements of that comparable State cause of action.

       <p>
        Inmate's claim that the Vermont Department of Corrections (DOC) and its commissioner violated a statutory obligation to negotiate a contract for telephone services to inmates that provided for the lowest reasonable cost lacked merit as to his request for monetary damages, as the State did not waive its sovereign immunity because it was based upon the DOC's performance of a discretionary function and there was no private analog. Wool v. Menard, 207 Vt. 25, 185 A.3d 577 (Mar. 9, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        The State's obligation to protect inmate who committed suicide while incarcerated was analogous to that of a private institution with custody over a person at risk of suicide. Hebert v. State, 165 Vt. 557, 679 A.2d 887 (mem.) (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly concluded that sovereign immunity barred claim against the State where commissioner of department of motor vehicles and commissioner of department of corrections released prisoner on furlough and issued or failed to revoke his registration. Curran v. Marcille, 152 Vt. 247, 565 A.2d 1362 (1989).

       <p>
        The State has not assumed liability for accidents caused by institutional inmates allowed to drive, and damages arising from an accident would not, as such, have as their legal cause the wrongful act of a State employee, except to the extent the employee exercises his discretion by allowing the inmate to drive. 1972 Op.

        ยง
        6906(c), was analogous to suits against private parties, and therefore could proceed. Czechorowski v. State, 178 Vt. 524, 872 A.2d 883 (mem.) (March 22, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services (SRS) had a duty to protect plaintiffs, child abuse victims who reported abuse, from continued abuse, and because their suit was analogous to tort suits against private persons, it was not barred by subsection (a). Sabia v. State, 164 Vt. 293, 669 A.2d 1187 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>

         5. Duty of care.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Presence of a common law duty of care is sufficient to meet the requirements of the Vermont Tort Claims Act. Thus, the fact that no statute required the Vermont Department of Public Safety to undertake the responsibility of performing a "welfare check" did not mean that no duty of care existed to the decedent on whose welfare troopers checked. Kennery v. State, 191 Vt. 44, 38 A.3d 35 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a negligence case, the first question in applying the Vermont Tort Claims Act is whether the State owes the plaintiff a duty of care under the circumstances. Whether a duty of care exists is a question of law for the court. Earle v. State, 180 Vt. 284, 910 A.2d 841 (September 1, 2006).

        In determining whether a governmental body has undertaken a duty of care towards a specific individual, as distinguished from its duty to the public at large, the court considers four factors: (1) whether an ordinance or statute sets forth mandatory acts for the protection of a particular class of persons; (2) whether the government has actual knowledge that particular persons within that class are in danger; (3) whether there has been reliance by those persons on the government's representations or conduct; and (4) whether the government's failure to use due care would increase the risk of harm beyond its present potential.

        With regard to claims involving allegations that the Vermont Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services (SRS) was liable for a sexual assault on plaintiff because it placed the perpetrator-a child in its custody-in the home of plaintiff's grandparents and failed to control him while he was there, because there was no allegation that SRS knew that the perpetrator was dangerous or presented a known risk of sexually assaulting a young child, it had no duty to plaintiff to avoid placing him in the grandparents' home or to control him while he was there.

        The licensing and inspection of day-care facilities are inherently governmental functions, the primary purpose of which is to enforce compliance with the law, not to render services to the facilities, which functions find no private analog or duty of care in the common law.

        In determining whether a governmental body has assumed a duty of care toward specified persons, above and beyond its duty to the public at large, Court considers four factors: (1) whether a statute sets forth mandatory acts for the protection of a particular class of persons; (2) whether the government has knowledge that particular persons within that class are in danger; (3) whether those persons have relied on the government's representations or conduct; and (4) whether the government's failure to use due care would increase the risk of harm beyond what it was at the time the government acted or failed to act.

        Plaintiffs' negligent-undertaking and negligent misrepresentation claims against the State were not barred by sovereign immunity. Their claims were based on common-law theories of negligence that were equally applicable to government employees and private individuals, and the discretionary-function exception of the Vermont Tort Claims Act did not apply because once the State committed to reviews, monitoring, and auditing of projects, its alleged failure to conduct such functions was a ministerial failure - a failure to follow a specifically dictated course of action.

        With regard to its investigation of the sexual exploitation of plaintiff inmate by a corrections officer, the Department of Corrections (DOC) had not waived sovereign immunity under the discretionary function exception. The DOC was not required to adopt investigation procedures and it was speculative whether its failure to do so would have prevented plaintiff's sexual exploitation, when plaintiff himself subverted the investigation through his actions and untruthful denials; furthermore, DOC's failure to separate plaintiff and the officer during the investigation was part of DOC's exercise of judgment.

        Department of Corrections (DOC) had not waived sovereign immunity under the discretionary function exception in connection with its decision to reposition a surveillance camera and with its interpretation of the employment contract of a corrections officer who sexually exploited plaintiff, because in the absence of any clear instructions requiring DOC to take either action, the actions were discretionary. Furthermore, whether a change in the camera's position would have prevented the misconduct was speculative, as was whether a different interpretation of the contract would have led DOC to separate the officer and plaintiff.

        Under the test for determining whether a plaintiff's claims are barred by the discretionary function exception to tort liability, a court must first determine whether the act or omission challenged by the plaintiff is one that involves an element of judgment or choice or whether a statute, regulation, or policy specifically prescribes a course of action for an employee to follow. If the court concludes that the act involves judgment or choice, it must then determine whether that judgment is one of the kind that the discretionary function exception was designed to shield.

        Standard of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets and Highways which states that "[t]he control of road users through a temporary traffic control zone shall be an essential part of . . . maintenance operations" does not prescribe a specific course of action for Agency of Transportation employees to follow, but rather requires them to exercise "an element of judgment or choice" when selecting from competing temporary traffic controls.

        The Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices for Streets (MUTCD) specifically authorizes Agency of Transportation employees to make decisions about what manner of temporary traffic control to use in a given situation.

       <p>
        The two-part test for determining the applicability of the discretionary function exception first asks whether a statute, regulation, or policy specifically prescribes a course of action for the employee to follow. If so, the discretion requirement is not met. If, however, the acts involved are discretionary in nature, involving an element of judgment or choice, the first prong of the test is satisfied.

       <p>
        Under the second prong of the two-part test for determining the applicability of the discretionary function exception, the court must decide whether the employee's judgment involved considerations of public policy which the discretionary function exception was designed to protect. It is presumed that when a government agent is authorized to exercise discretion, the agent's acts are grounded in policy when exercising that discretion. Thus, to survive a motion for summary judgment, plaintiff must allege facts sufficient to overcome the presumption that the discretion involved policy considerations. Estate of Gage v.

        In regard to plaintiff's negligence claim against the State, because she presented no argument on how her claim was comparable to a recognized cause of action against a private person, her brief was wholly inadequate on the negligence issue because it omitted discussion of an essential element of her claim and, therefore there was no reason to disturb the trial court's dismissal of her claim.

         11. Highway design exception.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        For purposes of sovereign immunity, plaintiff had not shown that the Agency of Transportation intended to incorporate an American Association of State Highway Officials (AASHO) or other design standard for a highway shoulder that was different from the standard in the Vermont Roadway Design Manual. Nothing in the Manual required that the AASHO standards be followed in every instance, suggested that AASHO trumped state-specific standards in the Manual, or incorporated the specific AASHO standard concerning shoulder slopes on a superelevated roadway; furthermore, the State's reliance on AASHO for guidance in developing its own state-specific standards did not support the contention that the State adopted AASHO in preference to those state-specific standards. Vanderbloom v. State, 200 Vt. 150, 129 A.3d 665 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        In regard to exception to the general waiver of immunity that protects the State from "[a]ny claim arising from the selection of or purposeful deviation from a particular set of standards for the planning and design of highways," liability is preserved in circumstances where the state unintentionally failed to comply with chosen design standards. Lane v. State, 174 Vt. 219, 811 A.2d 190 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Decision of highway or state police officials to act if their evaluation of road conditions leads them to conclude that closing portions of the State's highways for emergency reasons is necessary clearly involves an element of judgment or choice, and therefore is discretionary in nature. Lane v. State, 174 Vt. 219, 811 A.2d 190 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff failed to allege facts to overcome the presumption that the decision to close a road due to inclement weather is a discretionary function that involves the kind of public policy judgment protected by the discretionary function exemption.

        Decision whether or not to erect a highway warning sign is a discretionary act protected by the discretionary immunity exception. Lane v. State, 174 Vt. 219, 811 A.2d 190 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Absent evidence that the State deemed a warning sign necessary but failed to erect one, or that the failure to erect a sign was not based on public policy considerations, the placement of signs is a discretionary function immune from suit. Lane v. State, 174 Vt. 219, 811 A.2d 190 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff's evidence of the State's alleged negligence in failing to comply with Federal Highway Administration's Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD) requirements, consisting of testimony of the operator of the car claiming to have no knowledge of posted warnings signs and the supervisor for the relevant district having no record of which direction the existing signs were facing on the day of the accident, did not raise any issue of material fact as to whether the State was negligent in failing to comply with MUTCD requirements.

        Investors' securities-fraud claim against the Vermont Agency of Commerce and Community Development (ACCD) was barred by sovereign immunity, and therefore the trial court did not err by dismissing the claim, because the gravamen of the investors' claim was that ACCD made intentional misrepresentations, acted with deceit, and engaged in fraud, and the State had not waived its sovereign immunity with respect to such claims.

        Two individual defendants were entitled to absolute immunity from the investors' gross negligence claim because they were being used for alleged actions undertaken when they were Secretaries of the Vermont Agency of Commerce and Community Development and the actions at issue, failing to provide the promised oversight of the project in which the investors invested, fell within the general authority of their office.

       <p>
        Former executive director of the Vermont Regional Center was entitled to qualified immunity from the investors' gross negligence claim because the investors only alleged that he marketed and solicited investors for the projects, and failed to allege that he was not acting in the course of his employment, acting in good faith, and performing discretionary acts.

        It could not be determined that two former executive directors of the Vermont Regional Center (VRC) were entitled to qualified immunity from the investors' gross negligence claim because the allegations that they made misrepresentations to investors about the financial oversight that the VRC provided over the projects, acted to protect the projects instead of the investors, and approved the projects to solicit more investors even after complaints were made alleging that the projects were misappropriating funds were sufficient to show that their conduct failed the good faith prong.

        When troopers performing a "welfare check" on an elderly decedent checked the wrong house, the determination of whether they were grossly negligent was for the jury. Under plaintiff's version of the facts, the troopers made multiple errors in judgment in performing a straightforward task, and these errors arose in a context where the need for particular care was great; thus, reasonable minds could differ on what level of negligence to assign to the troopers' conduct. Kennery v. State, 191 Vt. 44, 38 A.3d 35 (2011).

       <p>
        Where plaintiff's complaint against the Office of Child Support and individual employees alleged simple incompetence, inaccurate record keeping, and clerical errors, such claims did not rise to the level of gross negligence.

       <p>
        Trial court did not err dismissing the investors' negligence claims against the individual defendants, current or former employees of the State, because the investors did not appear to contend that they were acting outside the scope of their employment. Sutton v. Vt. Reg'l Ctr., 212 Vt.
    - , 238 A.3d 608 (July 31, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        In suits alleging injury caused by the acts or omissions of a State employee acting within the scope of their employment, the Vermont Code states that the exclusive right of action shall lie against the State of Vermont; and no such action may be maintained against the employee or the estate of the employee. As plaintiffs did not appear to contend that the individually named defendants were acting outside the scope of their employment, plaintiffs' claims for negligence lay solely against the State. Sutton v. Vt. Reg'l Ctr., 212 Vt.

       </p>
       <p>
        In the context of a former school superintendent's State defamation and invasion of privacy claims, no reasonable jury could conclude from the undisputed facts that a State trooper's actions amounted to willful misconduct or gross negligence; the defamation and invasion of privacy claims therefore could be brought exclusively against the State of Vermont. Tucker v. Decker, - F.3d - (2d Cir. Mar. 16, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Generally, claims based on the acts or omissions of an employee of the State acting within the scope of employment lie against the State, not against the individual employees who allegedly committed the harm; however, the Vermont Tort Claims Act allows claims to be brought against an employee for gross negligence or willful misconduct, even if the conduct occurred within the scope of employment. Amy's Enters. v. Sorrell, 174 Vt. 623, 817 A.2d 612 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action against intermediate officials and liquor control inspectors arising from an investigation into illegal gaming tickets, by failing to assert facts sufficient to meet the requirements of this section, plaintiff failed to state a claim against individual defendant officials upon which a court could grant relief. Amy's Enters. v. Sorrell, 174 Vt. 623, 817 A.2d 612 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Tort Claims Act is an exclusive right of action, and claims based on the act or omission of an employee of the State acting within the scope of employment lie against the State of Vermont, not against the employee. Powers v. Office of Child Support, 173 Vt. 390, 795 A.2d 1259 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because Vermont law creates no specific duty owed by Office of Child Support (OCS) to any particular person or group of persons, there was no duty owed to plaintiff as an individual by the employees of OCS for their work on behalf of the agency, and, therefore, plaintiff could not prove an action for simple or gross negligence against the employees. Powers v. Office of Child Support, 173 Vt. 390, 795 A.2d 1259 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff's claims were premised on allegations of willful misconduct by State employees, this section did not bar the claims against the individual defendants. Huminski v. Lavoie, 173 Vt. 517, 787 A.2d 489 (mem.) (2001), overruled in part as stated in O'Connor v. Donovan, 2012 VT 27, 191 Vt. 412, 48 A.3d 584.

       <p>
        Private attorney who contracted with State Defender General to represent indigent defendants at State's expense was not a State employee within meaning of statute, and he was thus amenable to civil malpractice liability. Reed v. Glynn, 168 Vt. 504, 724 A.2d 464 (1998).

     When delineating the authority of arbitrators operating under the authority of Vermont's general arbitration law, the Vermont Arbitration Act, 12 V.S.A.
     ยงยง
     5651-5681, the Legislature clearly enumerated the very limited grounds upon which arbitrators may modify an award: (1) there was an evident miscalculation of figures or an evident mistake in the description of any person, thing or property referred to in the award; or (2) the arbitrators have awarded upon a matter not submitted to them and the award may be corrected without affecting the merits of the decision upon the issues submitted; or (3) the award is imperfect in a matter of form, not affecting the merits of the controversy; the negative implication is that the Motor Vehicle Arbitration Board does not have authority to modify a final award.

       <p>
        Both the Federal Arbitration Act and the Vermont Arbitration Act applied to an arbitration agreement which was formed in Vermont and which the defendant sought to enforce in Vermont; however, in considering issues of both procedural unconscionability relating to the form of the contract to arbitrate and substantive unconscionability relating to its content, the federal court was guided by Vermont decisional law where it was available. Littlejohn v. Timberquest Park at Magic, LLC, - F. Supp. 2d - (D. Vt. July 21, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a provision of an agreement made clear the parties' intention to arbitrate under the Federal Arbitration Act (FAA) rather than the Vermont Arbitration Act, the court had to give effect to this choice. Given the court's broad implementation and enforcement jurisdiction under the agreement, there was no authority in the FAA to divest the court from hearing an appeal from the trial court's order interpreting the provision; accordingly, the court had jurisdiction to hear the appeal. State v. Philip Morris USA Inc., 183 Vt. 176, 945 A.2d 887 (Feb. 1, 2008).

    Unless otherwise provided in the agreement, a written agreement to submit any existing controversy to arbitration or a provision in a written contract to submit to arbitration any controversy thereafter arising between the parties creates a duty to arbitrate, and is valid, enforceable, and irrevocable, except upon such grounds as exist for the revocation of a contract.

    No agreement to arbitrate is enforceable unless accompanied by or containing a written acknowledgment of arbitration signed by each of the parties or their representatives.
    When contained in the same document as the agreement to arbitrate, that acknowledgment shall be displayed prominently.
    The acknowledgment shall provide substantially as follows:
      </li>
     </ol>
     <p>
      "ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF ARBITRATION.

      I understand that (this agreement/my agreement with

    ) contains an agreement to arbitrate.
    After signing (this/that) document, I understand that I will not be able to bring a lawsuit concerning any dispute that may arise which is covered by the arbitration agreement, unless it involves a question of constitutional or civil rights.
    Instead, I agree to submit any such dispute to an impartial arbitrator."

        Having already signed an arbitration agreement, plaintiffs were duty-bound to continue with the proceeding, regardless of whether their attorney "reserved" this issue for later litigation or "waived" it. Plaintiffs therefore could not show in their legal malpractice case that the attorney's decision to "withdraw" the statute-of-limitations issue at the hearing and to continue with the arbitration, once it had begun, was the proximate cause of any of their injuries.

        Given the clear requirements of the arbitration statute and the important rights at stake, mere silence by one party in response to another party's representation that an arbitration agreement has been reached is insufficient to create an enforceable agreement.

        When plaintiff's counsel told the trial court simply that the parties had orally agreed to an arbitration provision and planned to work out the terms between themselves, after which defendants did not respond and no further mention of arbitration was made at the hearing, defendants' silence was insufficient to constitute an enforceable stipulation to arbitrate and to demonstrate a knowing and voluntary waiver of the protections of the statute.

       <p>
        By specifying, for court review of an arbitration award, that "an application to the superior court . . . shall be by motion and shall be heard in the manner and upon the notice provided by law or rule," the Legislature intended that judicial intervention would be based on summary procedures, by motion practice rules.
    The court correctly followed the motion rule, and its erroneous labeling of the application as a motion for summary judgment did not violate defendant's procedural rights under statute or rules, and certainly did not violate its due process rights.

        There was no merit to a telephone company's argument that under the Federal Arbitration Act and the Vermont Arbitration Act, which both directed a court to summarily determine whether the making of an agreement to arbitrate was in dispute, the trial court should have held a hearing on the issue of when a customer's cell phone contract was assigned to the company. After the trial court denied the company's motion to compel arbitration, it expressly considered the new evidence submitted by the company and denied its motion to reconsider; what the company appeared to be requesting was a third bite at the apple.

       <p>
        Neither the civil rules nor the Vermont Arbitration Act contain authorization for filing a counterclaim in response to a motion to confirm an arbitration award.
    Allowing a counterclaim would be inconsistent with the summary procedure established, and it would be difficult in such circumstances to ensure expeditious relief to the prevailing party and at the same time protect the procedural rights of the counterclaimant, particularly the right to trial by jury. Springfield Teachers Ass'n v. Springfield School Directors, 167 Vt. 180, 705 A.2d 541 (1997).

         2. Finality.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        An arbitrator's award reinstating grievant to a full-time teaching position and ordering that he be made "whole for earnings lost" was as final as it could be for purposes of enforcement, as it was impossible to know when grievant would be reinstated and how much back pay would be due at that time.
    The proper resolution on appeal was to sever the award and confirm the arbitrator's decision on the merits, but refer the matter back to the arbitrator for determination of the back pay award. Springfield Teachers Ass'n v. Springfield School Directors, 167 Vt. 180, 705 A.2d 541 (1997).

       </h5>
       <p>
        A court may review a claim that the arbitrator exceeded the authority conferred on him or her by the parties. However, such a determination must be based on evidence clearly demonstrating that the arbitrator exceeded his or her authority, and any doubts about the scope of the parties' agreement should be resolved in favor of coverage. Brinckerhoff v. Brinckerhoff, 179 Vt. 532, 889 A.2d 701 (mem.) (July 15, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Scope of trial court's review of arbitration award is limited to ensuring that the arbitration proceedings fall within the boundaries of due process, and the court shall confirm the award unless grounds are established to vacate or modify it.

        Defendant was provided a copy of the arbitration award in December 2009, but did not seek to vacate the award until February 2011, when it opposed plaintiff's motion to confirm the award.

      The General Assembly finds that agricultural production is a major contributor to the State's economy; that agricultural lands constitute unique and irreplaceable resources of statewide importance; that the continuation of existing and the initiation of new agricultural activities preserve the landscape and environmental resources of the State, contribute to the increase of tourism, and further the economic welfare and self-sufficiency of the people of the State; and that the encouragement, development, improvement, and preservation of agriculture will result in a general benefit to the health and welfare of the people of the State. In order for the agricultural industry to survive in this State, farms will likely change, adopt new technologies, and diversify into new products, which for some farms will mean increasing in size. The General Assembly finds that agricultural activities are potentially subject to lawsuits based on the theory of nuisance, and that these suits encourage and could force the premature removal of the farmlands and other farm resources from agricultural use. It is the purpose of this chapter to protect reasonable agricultural activities conducted on the farm from nuisance lawsuits.

      The purpose of this chapter is to encourage owners to make their land and water available to the public for no consideration for recreational uses by clearly establishing a rule that an owner shall have no greater duty of care to a person who, without consideration, enters or goes upon the owner's land for a recreational use than the owner would have to a trespasser.

         1. Applicability.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Recreational Use Statute did not apply in a case where plaintiff rode his motorcycle into a cable strung across a beach access road at the lakeside residential development where he lived, as the land was not open to members of the general public, but only to the development's residents and their guests. Crogan v. Pine Bluff Estates, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (June 11, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Recreational Use Statute applied to a daycare's use of defendants' land and shielded them from liability, as the daycare used the land without consideration, the daycare used the land for recreational and educational purposes, and the land was "open and undeveloped" and despite defendants having once owned the daycare property, which they sold to family members, and despite a sandbox, mowed pathways, and a brook bridge being on the property, and despite the fact that the daycare owners might have profited from the use of the land. Nolan v. Fishman, 211 Vt. 1, 218 A.3d 1034 (Sept. 6, 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Inclusion of "guiding" as a protected recreational use in the Recreational Use Statute indicates that persons using the land may profit from their use. The statute does not become inapplicable to landowners simply because a third party may have earned some level of profit from its use of the land. Nolan v. Fishman, 211 Vt. 1, 218 A.3d 1034 (Sept. 6, 2019).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Nothing in the statutory language of the Recreational Use Statute supports a conclusion that the relationship status between the landowner and the land user defeats the statute's protections. Nolan v. Fishman, 211 Vt. 1, 218 A.3d 1034 (Sept. 6, 2019).

        The expression of an opinion during trial by a juror concerning the merits of the case, or probable outcome, to anyone but a fellow juror, disqualifies him from participating in the result and will destroy the verdict. Isabelle v. Proctor Hospital, 129 Vt. 500, 282 A.2d 837 (1971).

       <p>
        A verdict should not be overthrown solely on basis of affidavits that a juror had discussed the case with non-juror during trial and had already made up his mind; proper proceedings to ascertain the truth of the statements in the affidavit should immediately be had, and the other party afforded an opportunity to meet the statements in the affidavits. Isabelle v. Proctor Hospital, 129 Vt. 500, 282 A.2d 837 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, both during trial and after verdict but before judgment, plaintiffs in medical malpractice case presented affidavits that a juror had talked to affiants and other non-jurors about the case during the trial and had stated he had made up his mind that plaintiffs should recover nothing, it was error for the court, which declined to inquire into the affidavit presented during trial, to decline to inquire into the affidavit presented after verdict, but such error was not fatal to the verdict where the facts could be determined and the issue resolved on remand in disposing of plaintiffs' motion to set verdict aside and grant a new trial. Isabelle v. Proctor Hospital, 129 Vt. 500, 282 A.2d 837 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiffs in medical malpractice action presented, during trial, affidavit of a non-juror that one of the jurors had discussed the case with affiant and others not on the jury and had stated that he had made up his mind that plaintiffs should recover nothing, and plaintiffs, with agreement of defendants, moved for replacement of the juror with an alternate, court should have held an immediate inquiry to determine the truth of the statements in the affidavit, rather than denying the motion without hearing. Isabelle v. Proctor Hospital, 129 Vt. 500, 282 A.2d 837 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court's examination of individual jurors concerning misconduct should only be undertaken after it is satisfied there is probable cause for setting aside the verdict and the inquiry should be conducted in the presence of opposing counsel.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The oath prescribed by this section, being almost exactly the same as that regularly administered to juries in criminal cases at the common law is in keeping with Vermont constitution, ch. 1, art. 10, since the constitution in guaranteeing jury trial contemplated a jury trial as known to the common law. State v. Graves, 119 Vt. 205, 122 A.2d 840 (1956).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where jurors did not take the oath prescribed for criminal causes, but at beginning of term took that prescribed for civil causes, and respondent's counsel was unaware of the omission until some progress had been made in the trial, and respondent was not present at trial and had no knowledge of the omission, there was no waiver of respondent's rights in proceeding with the trial. State v. Davis, 52 Vt. 376 (1880).
