     <p>
      Whenever the Agency of Transportation determines that a company subject to its supervision is failing or omitting or is about to fail or omit to do anything required of it by law or by order of the Board or is doing anything or permitting anything or is about to do anything or to permit anything to be done contrary to or in violation of law or of any order of the Board, the Agency of Transportation may commence an action or proceeding in any Superior Court for the purpose of having the violations or threatened violations stopped and prevented by injunction.
    An action or proceeding shall begin by a petition alleging the violation and asking for appropriate relief by way of injunction.
    It shall then be the duty of the court to specify the time, not exceeding 21 days after service of a copy of the petition, within which the company complained of must answer the petition, and the court may grant a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction in accordance with the laws of the State and rules in the case made and provided.
    In case of default in answer, or after answer, the court shall immediately inquire into the facts and circumstances in the manner as the court directs without other or formal pleadings and without respect to any technical requirement.
    Any other persons as it shall seem to the court necessary or proper to join as parties in order to make its order, judgment, or writs effective may be joined as parties upon application of counsel to the Agency. The final judgment in any injunction action or proceedings shall either dismiss the action or proceeding or direct that an injunction be issued as asked for in the petition or in a modified form as the court may determine will afford appropriate relief.

      When an annual report for any year is not given to the Agency of Transportation and the tax due is not paid on or before the next April 15, there shall be added to the tax an additional amount equal to five percent or $10.00, whichever is greater, if the return is made and tax paid within 15 days after becoming due, and 25 percent of the tax or $50.00, whichever is greater, if the return is not made and tax paid within 15 days after becoming due.
    When a company that has failed to file the return or has filed an incorrect or insufficient return and has been notified by the Agency of its delinquency, refuses or neglects within 20 days after notice to file a proper return, or files a fraudulent return, the Agency shall determine the tax due according to its best information and belief and shall increase the amount of the tax so determined by 50 percent or $20.00, whichever is greater.
    No assessment shall be made under this section unless made within four years from the date on which a correct return should have been filed, but the limitation of four years to the assessment of the tax or additional tax shall not apply to the assessment of additional taxes upon fraudulent returns.
    The Agency may waive the penalties mentioned in this section if it is satisfied that the default was for any justifiable cause, and it may extend the time for filing returns or paying the tax, not to exceed four months.

      The cities and towns of this State owning or operating a municipal airport, in order more readily to cooperate with the federal government to further national defense, are hereby empowered by their legislative bodies to lease or sell and convey to the United States or any proper department of the United States an airport for use as a government air base for the purposes of national defense and by the lease are hereby empowered to enter into any agreements with the United States or any department of the United States as the United States or the department may require for the purposes of national defense and the legislative body of the municipality may deem just and to grant to the United States the right, title, interest, control, and management for such purposes as the United States might acquire by the right of eminent domain and condemnation proceedings.
    Provision shall be made in such lease for adequate compensation for any damages that may be caused to private rights or interests in the airport which may arise by reason of the provisions of the lease, and provision shall also be made in the lease for the preservation of the use of the airport for civilian air commerce as the requirements of the government will permit, the purpose of the provisions of this section being to obviate the necessity of the government resorting to condemnation proceedings.
    In the event that any airport is sold to the United States under the provisions of this section and section 608 of this title for the purposes of national defense, the municipality shall be relieved from any obligations to hold the airport or any part of the airport for public use on reasonable terms and without discrimination.
    In the event the airport is leased to the federal government for the purpose of national defense, the municipality shall be relieved for the duration of the lease from any obligations to hold the airport or any part of the airport for public use on reasonable terms and without discrimination.

    The permit shall be issued if the structure, as erected or altered, conforms with the regulations, or will not constitute a greater hazard than the structure which is replaced or altered.
    In any event, however, all regulations shall provide that before any nonconforming airport hazard may be replaced, substantially altered, repaired, rebuilt, allowed to grow higher, or replanted, a permit must be secured from the administrative agency authorized to administer and enforce the regulations, authorizing the replacement, change, or repair.
    A permit shall not be granted that would allow the establishment or creation of an airport hazard or permit a nonconforming airport hazard or use to be made or become higher or become a greater hazard to air navigation than it was when the applicable regulation was adopted or than it is when the application for a permit is made.
    Except as provided in this chapter, all applications for permits shall be granted.

        The legislature intended to limit the use of the public highways of the state by common carriers to such operations as would promote the general good of the state, irrespective of the effect of such a limitation on competition. In re James, 99 Vt. 265, 132 A. 40 (1926).

        A certificate of public good for operation as a common carrier is a franchise and is a property right. In re Hathorn's Transportation Co., 121 Vt. 349, 158 A.2d 464 (1960).

        The holder of certificate or franchise had no power to cancel it, since the power to revoke was vested only in commission. In re Hathorn's Transportation Co., 121 Vt. 349, 158 A.2d 464 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        A public hearing was necessary to revoke a certificate in the same manner as it was necessary to issue a new certificate, or to amend one which was in effect. In re Hathorn's Transportation Co., 121 Vt. 349, 158 A.2d 464 (1960).

     <p>
      A certificate shall be issued only after written application has been made. Upon receipt of an application, the Board shall fix a time and place for hearing, which shall be in a town within which the route or a part of the route is proposed, and shall give notice of the pendency of the application and of the time and place of hearing to the applicant, and to any common carrier operating over any portion of the proposed route or over a route substantially parallel to the proposed route. The Board shall make an order for the publication of the substance of the petition and of the time and place of the hearing in a newspaper published in the county or counties where the proposed route is located, the publication to be at least 12 days before the day appointed for the hearing. A public hearing shall be held on the petition. To enable the provision of service for which there is an immediate or urgent need to a point or points within a territory having no carrier service capable of meeting those needs, the Board may, without hearings or other proceedings, grant temporary authority for the service by a common carrier. Temporary authority, unless suspended or revoked for good cause, shall be valid for the time as the Board shall specify but not more than an aggregate of 180 days and shall create no presumption that corresponding permit authority shall be granted.

When, in its judgment, a public investigation is necessary in the interests of public safety, it shall fix a time and place of holding the same and shall summon the person or corporation operating such railroad, the parties known to have been injured in the accident, and, if known, a representative or friend of a person killed thereby, to appear and give evidence regarding the cause of such accident. The Board shall also notify the State's Attorney of the county in which the accident occurred, who shall investigate the cause of the accident, produce witnesses who can give evidence in regard to the same, and attend and represent the State at such hearing. All parties summoned, and other persons interested, may appear and be made parties thereto, may produce witnesses or other evidence, and may be represented by counsel. On notice from the Board, the person or corporation operating the railroad shall produce all railroad employees who can give pertinent evidence in regard to the cause of the accident, free of expense to the State. The Board shall make public its determination in regard to the cause of the accident so investigated and cause a permanent record thereof to be made.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In a matter over which the Board has jurisdiction, a person or corporation that claims to be injured by the unlawful action or neglect of a railroad in this State may commence proceedings thereon by petition to the Board, with a copy to the Agency, therein setting forth briefly the cause of complaint. The State's Attorney of the county in which a matter arises, the Attorney General, the legislative body of a municipality, or any ten freeholders of such county by such complaint may bring before the Board any such matter wherein and whereby they claim the public safety is endangered or the charter or statutory law regulating railroads is being violated. When it has information that any railroad in this State is operating in violation of its charter or of the statutory law, the Board shall call the same to the attention of the Attorney General or the State's Attorney of the county where the matter arises. The Attorney General or the State's Attorney shall inquire into the same and, if in his or her judgment the matter should be investigated, he or she shall bring the same before the Board by proper complaint. On receipt of such complaint, the Board shall summon the person or persons complained of to appear before it and to make answer thereto. When issue is taken to the facts set out in the complaint, the Board shall appoint a time and place for hearing the same in the county where the matter arises, and shall then and there hear and determine the matter complained of. Nothing in this section shall be construed to empower the Board to award monetary damages to any person or entity, except as expressly provided by law.

     <p>
      Before a railroad corporation commences proceedings for the purpose of acquiring title to real estate or an interest therein, and, within two years from its incorporation, it shall cause a map or plan of the location of its road defining the courses, distances, and boundaries of the same in each town through which it passes, signed by a majority of the directors, to be recorded in the respective clerk's offices of such towns. If the road passes through an unorganized town or gore, the location shall be recorded in the offices in which conveyances of real estate situated therein are required by law to be recorded.

      When a railroad corporation has entered upon and used land and real estate for the construction and accommodation of its railroad and has, by its engineers, agents, or servants, entered upon land contiguous to the railroad or the works connected therewith and taken materials to use in the construction of its road, and has not paid the owner therefor nor, within two years from such entry, had the damages appraised by commissioners and an award made and delivered, a person claiming damages, within six years after such entry, may bring an action therefor before a Superior Court. An answer justifying the entry under the act incorporating the company shall not bar the action, but the plaintiff shall recover only his or her actual damages.

      When the location of a railroad is changed after the payment of damages to a landowner, and a portion of the lands of such owner is not taken for the new location, the lands taken for the first location shall revert to the owner. The railroad corporation may recover from such landowner the amount so paid as damages, deducting therefrom the damages which accrued to the owner in consequence of locating the railroad across his or her lands, which shall be ascertained by the Transportation Board. The landowner, if he or she chooses, may convey to the corporation the land so located upon, and retain the sum so awarded.

      When a highway is so located that such railroad cannot be judiciously constructed across or upon the same without interfering therewith, the railroad corporation, with the consent of the Board, may cause such highway to be changed so that such railroad may be constructed on the best site for that purpose. However, such corporation shall put such highway as near as practicable in as good a situation and repair as it was previous to such alteration, under the direction of the Board. Such construction or alteration shall not be made without notice to all parties interested and a hearing before the Board.

       <p>
        Failure of train to sound its whistle eighty rods from a railroad crossing, contrary to this section, does not excuse the driver of an automobile approaching the crossing from his duty to exercise due care for his own safety, but such failure is a circumstance to be taken into consideration in determining whether the driver exercised the requisite care. Baldwin v. State, 126 Vt. 70, 223 A.2d 556 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is the duty of a driver to look and listen for approaching trains as he nears a railroad crossing and if, by such vigilant use of his sight and hearing as a prudent person would make under the circumstances, he might have discovered and avoided the danger, he will be guilty of contributory negligence if he omits such vigilance.

        Although any shortage in a train's duty under subsection (a) of this section to sound its whistle or bell when approaching a crossing will not excuse the driver of a motor vehicle from his duty to exercise due care for his own safety, such shortage is a circumstance to be taken into consideration in determining whether or not the driver exercised the requisite care, since negligence cannot be imputed to one who is deceived by circumstances calculated to mislead a prudent person.

       A person or corporation owning or operating a railroad shall construct and maintain farm crossings of the road for the use of the proprietors of lands adjoining the railroad, and cattle guards at all farm and road crossings sufficient to prevent cattle and animals from getting on the railroad. A farm crossing may be temporarily or permanently closed or discontinued by mutual agreement between all parties having an interest therein. If no such mutual agreement can be reached by such interested parties, then a person or corporation owning or operating a railroad and desiring to close any farm crossing shall make application to the Transportation Board. The Board shall thereupon give notice to all parties interested, in such manner as the Board may direct, of hearing on the application, the hearing to be in the county where such crossing is located. After the hearing, a person or corporation owning or operating a railroad shall not close such farm crossing without the approval of the Transportation Board. A person aggrieved by the closing of a farm crossing after January 1, 1955 by a person or corporation owning or operating a railroad may notify the Transportation Board by registered or certified mail of the closing, and thereupon the Board shall conduct a hearing. Notice and place of hearing shall be as set forth in this subsection. The Transportation Board may require the reopening of any such crossing and make such other order as is permitted in section 3649 of this title. At any such hearing, the burden of proof shall rest with the person or persons effecting or seeking to effect the closing of such farm crossing. Any person aggrieved by an order of the Transportation Board may, in accordance with Rule 74 of the Vermont Rules of Civil Procedure, appeal to the Superior Court, whereupon such cause shall be tried as an original action brought under the provisions of <cite class="vt-code">12 V.S.A. § 402</cite>.

        Section 3639 of this title, governing construction and maintenance of cattle guards, and this section were intended to protect travelers, riding in trains on railroads, from accidents that might occur by reason of animals being at large upon the railroad track for want of sufficient cattle guards at road and farm crossings, as well as to compensate owners for animals injured for want thereof.

       </p>

        Railroads were liable for damages done by their agents or engines to cattle, horses or other animals, if occasioned by want of cattle guards, without regard to whether such animals were lawfully on road crossing or not. Harwood's Administratrix v. Bennington & Rutland Railway, 67 Vt. 664, 32 A. 721 (1895); Quimby v. Boston & Maine Railroad, 71 Vt. 301, 45 A. 223 (1899); Aldrich v.

       </h5>
       <p>
        In an action against railroad company for not maintaining sufficient cattle guard, whereby plaintiff's horse passed from highway onto track and was injured, it was no defense that horse escaped from control of owner, who was lawfully leading it along highway, through his neglect.

      The selectboard of a town within which a public highway crosses or is crossed by a railroad, or the general manager or attorney of a railroad corporation whose road crosses or is crossed by a public highway, may bring their petition in writing to the Transportation Board, alleging that public safety requires an alteration in such crossing, its approaches, the method of crossing, the location of the public highway, the elimination of such crossing, the closing of such public highway crossing and the substitution of another therefor, not at grade, or the removal of obstructions to the sight at such crossing, and praying that the same may be ordered, or such proceedings may be instituted by the Agency of Transportation or the Board of its own motion and without petition. The Board shall thereupon appoint a time and place for hearing the petition on notice of not less than ten days to the petitioners, the railroad, the municipality in which such crossing is situated, the owners of the land adjoining such crossing, and adjoining that part of the highway to be changed in grade, and to the Attorney General, who shall, by himself or herself or through the State's Attorney of the county wherein the crossing is located, represent the interests of the State at such hearing. After such notice and hearing, the Board shall determine what alterations, changes, or removals, if any, shall be made and by whom.

After such notice and hearing, the Board shall determine what alterations shall be made, if any, so as to separate the grades of all such crossings at the same time, and shall determine by whom such work shall be done, and shall apportion the expense to be borne by the railroad corporations between such corporations in such manner as the Board deems just and proper.

     </h3>
     <p>
      When a railroad corporation, a town, or any other party is ordered to do the requisite work in the alteration, changes, or removals at a railroad-highway crossing, or on lands or obstructions to the view near such crossing and it is necessary to take land to carry out such order, the party ordered to do the work shall cause such land to be surveyed and furnish a copy thereof to the owner of such land or his agent. Whereupon, in case the owner of such land and the parties ordered to do the work cannot agree on the price of the land and the damage to the owners resulting from such taking, either party in interest may make written application to the Board. After hearing had, on notice of not less than ten days to the same parties for whom notice is provided in section 3785 of this title, such Board shall first adjudge whether the taking of such land is necessary and, if so adjudged, shall appraise the same and award such damages for the taking thereof as are just.
