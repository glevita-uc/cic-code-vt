        Defendant Vermont Department of Labor and Industry wrongly interpreted the Superior Court's statement faulting plaintiffs for failure to proceed under the rule governing review of governmental action as a ruling that plaintiffs' claims were brought outside the statute of limitations. The only time bar raised by defendant in the trial court was with respect to plaintiffs' challenge under the statute governing appeals from actions taken by the Commissioner of Labor and Industry; the defendant failed to address any applicable bar to plaintiffs' mandamus claims, and responded to these claims only in terms of its lack of a mandatory duty. Thus, this issue was not addressed on appeal. Alger v. Department of Labor & Industry, 181 Vt. 309, 917 A.2d 508 (2006).

        Provision of this section that employer shall furnish workplaces free from recognized hazards causing or likely to cause death or significant physical harm does not impose an absolute duty or absolute liability upon employers; the preventative and deterrent nature of VOSHA indicates the duty is to be an achievable one, and the policies underlying VOSHA do not accord with a finding that an absolute duty exists.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where power company issued safety instructions and held safety meetings, and with respect to first class linemen, had policy that all safety determinations regarding protective covering were to be made by the first class lineman doing the work, even when he or she was under immediate supervision of a foreman, company did not discharge its responsibility under this section to provide employees with workplaces free of recognized hazards causing or likely to cause death or significant physical harm.

       </p>
       <p>
        A recognized hazard, within this section, is preventable if demonstrably feasible measures taken by employer materially reduce likelihood of existence of the hazard; and if additional feasible steps could not have been taken to avoid noncompliance with the requirements of VOSHA by employees there is no basis for imposing liability where employee noncompliance causes harm to the employee.

       Any person adversely affected or aggrieved by an order of the Review Board may appeal to any Superior Court for the county in which the violation is alleged to have occurred or where the employer has its principal office. The appeal shall be taken within 30 days following the issuance of such order. The court shall have power to grant such temporary relief or restraining order as it deems just and proper, and to make and enter upon the pleadings, testimony, and proceedings set forth in such record a decree affirming, modifying, or setting aside in whole or in part, the order of the Review Board and enforcing the same to the extent that such order is affirmed or modified. The commencement of proceedings under this subsection shall not, unless ordered by the court, operate as a stay of the order of the Review Board. No objection that has not been urged before the Review Board shall be considered by the court, unless the failure or neglect to urge such objection shall be excused because of extraordinary circumstances. The findings of the Review Board with respect to questions of fact, if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, shall be conclusive. If any party shall apply to the court for leave to adduce additional evidence and shall show to the satisfaction of the court that such additional evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce such evidence in the hearing before the Review Board, the court may order such additional evidence to be taken before the Review Board and to be made a part of the record. The Review Board may modify its findings as to the facts, or make new findings, by reason of additional evidence so taken and filed, and it shall file such modified or new findings, which findings with respect to questions of fact, if supported by substantial evidence on the record considered as a whole, shall be conclusive, and its recommendations, if any, for the modification or setting aside of its original order. Upon the filing of the record with it, the jurisdiction of the court shall be exclusive and its judgment and decree shall be final, except that the same shall be subject to review by the Supreme Court. Judicial review under this subsection shall be considered expeditiously.

If judicial review is not sought within 30 days after service of the Review Board's order, the Review Board's findings of fact and order shall be conclusive in connection with any petition for enforcement which is filed by the Commissioner after the expiration of such 30-day period. In any such case, as well as in the case of a noncontested citation or notification by the Commissioner, which has become a final order of the Review Board, the clerk of the court, unless otherwise ordered by the court, shall forthwith enter a decree enforcing the order and shall transmit a copy of such court decree to the Commissioner and the employer named in the petition. In any contempt proceeding brought to enforce a court decree entered pursuant to this subsection or subsection (a) of this section, the court may assess the penalties provided in addition to invoking any other available remedies.

     <p>
      In support of the State's fundamental interest in protecting the safety of minors and vulnerable adults, as defined in <cite class="vt-code">33 V.S.A. § 6902</cite>, it is the policy of the State of Vermont that no confidential employment separation agreement shall inhibit the disclosure to prospective employers and responsible licensing entities of factual information about a prospective employee's background that would lead a reasonable person to conclude that the prospective employee has engaged in conduct jeopardizing the safety of a minor or vulnerable adult. Any provision in an agreement entered into on or after the effective date of this section that attempts to do so is void and unenforceable.

        This section does not violate equal protection by requiring a higher standard of employers than of corporate officers, as there is a rational basis for the classification, in that employers have complete control over their business, whereas corporate officers are not similarly powerful, are limited by a board of directors, and often those responsible for payment of compensation are not the ones making the decisions which determine whether money will be on hand to pay the compensation.

        This section allows imprisonment for debt, an unenforceable penalty under chapter II, section 40 of the state constitution; but prosecution would not be dismissed, as the question whether provision for fine violated constitution was not briefed or argued and must await proper presentation before supreme court at another time.

        The purpose of this section is fulfilled if plaintiff has a claim that some wages remain unpaid at the time he brings suit. It is unreasonable and unnecessary to any purpose of the statute to require him to wait to bring suit until all possible damages have accrued. Stowell v.

        Where it was found that the practice was to pay plaintiff truck driver a commission, up to the amount of a claims reserve, about six weeks after a long haul was completed, under that practice, defendant owed plaintiff his commission on the date plaintiff brought suit. Thus, the action could be "maintained" under this section when plaintiff sued. Stowell v. Action Moving & Storage, Inc., 182 Vt. 98, 933 A.2d 1128 (June 1, 2007).

        An employer is permitted to deduct from minimum wage an amount for lodging, utilities, and other items which are usual in a particular industry, as determined by wage order initiated by wage board. Lanphear v. Tognelli, 157 Vt. 560, 601 A.2d 1384 (1991).

       <p>
        Court at trial for minimum wage violation erred in disregarding plain meaning of administrative wage order outlining permissible deduction from minimum wage and substituting opinion of department of labor and industry officials, where defendant motel owners advanced no reason for invalidity of wage order. Lanphear v. Tognelli, 157 Vt. 560, 601 A.2d 1384 (1991).

       <p>
        Although department of labor and industry officials, in declining to enforce wage order in minimum wage dispute, may have had good reason to doubt wisdom of fixed, artificially low allowance for lodging provided by employer, proper remedy was modification of regulation, not ad hoc disregard of it.

       Strong families are the foundation for a productive and competitive state. There are a growing number of single-parent families where the sole parent works and two-parent families where both parents work. Most people who work while raising families do so out of economic necessity.

       Leave from employment for the birth or adoption of a child or to care for a seriously ill family member addresses one of the important needs of changing family structures. The support of families is a principle recognized and valued by the State of Vermont. When employees have security about their employment and the well-being of their children, parents, and other family members, businesses benefit economically from increased worker productivity and stability.

       </h5>
       <p>
        In construing the definition of employee in Vermont's Parental and Family Leave Act (PFLA), although the statute is silent on the question of whether time spent on accrued sick leave or annual leave counts in calculating the 30 hours of work per week average, the only sensible construction is that it does; therefore, as long as plaintiff was using accrued leave balances that she had earned, the clock was still running toward the 52 weeks of continuous employment required for PFLA eligibility, just as she was continuing to accrue additional leave balances. Woolaver v. State, 175 Vt. 397, 833 A.2d 849 (2002).

       </h5>
       <p>
        In a discharge case under Vermont's Parental and Family Leave Act (PFLA), plaintiff must demonstrate that: (1) plaintiff was an employee within the meaning of the PFLA; (2) the employer is an employer under the PFLA; (3) the employer refused to reinstate plaintiff after PFLA leave; (4) prior to requesting leave plaintiff had not been given notice or given notice "that the employment would terminate"; and (5) plaintiff was terminated for reasons related to the leave or the condition for which the leave was granted, as prohibited by the PFLA; once plaintiff makes this prima facie case, the PFLA shifts both the burden of production and the burden of persuasion to the employer to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the reasons for termination were not related to the employee's request for leave or the condition for which leave was sought. Woolaver v. State, 175 Vt. 397, 833 A.2d 849 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Once plaintiff makes a prima facie case of wrongful discharge under Vermont's Parental and Family Leave Act, both the burden of production and the burden of persuasion is shifted to the employer to prove by clear and convincing evidence that the reasons for termination were not related to the employee's request for leave or the condition for which leave was sought. Woolaver v. State, 175 Vt. 397, 833 A.2d 849 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont's Parental and Family Leave Act does not protect an employee from being fired for performance reasons during the leave period, as long as the employer's decision withstands scrutiny that the firing is not related to the leave. Woolaver v. State, 175 Vt. 397, 833 A.2d 849 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Summary judgment in favor of the State on plaintiff's claim she was fired from her job while on parental leave in violation of Vermont's Parental and Family Leave Act could not be upheld because of the employer's lack of written documentation of her performance during the time she worked and because its extension of her probationary period and its failure to take action against her prior to leave remained unexplained. Woolaver v. State, 175 Vt. 397, 833 A.2d 849 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though plaintiff claimed that her performance problems were due to her pregnancy, Vermont's Parental and Family Leave Act neither excuses performance problems caused by the condition for which leave is taken nor requires an employer to give an employee an opportunity to show improved job performance following leave. Woolaver v. State, 175 Vt. 397, 833 A.2d 849 (2002).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Court rejected the argument of a claimant for unemployment benefits that the employer's violations of the workers' compensation reporting requirement and its arguable violation of the prohibition against employer-mandated polygraphs provided per se good cause for the claimant to quit her job. The referee and the Employment Security Board found that the claimant prematurely quit because she was offended by the employer's suggestion that she was lying about the circumstances surrounding her back injury, not because she felt threatened that she would be fired if she refused to take a polygraph test; furthermore, there was no evidence that the claimant faced having to forego her workers' compensation claim.

     "(3) Social science research thus far has shown that information contained in a credit report has no correlation to job performance. The Palmer-Koppes study conducted in 2004 found that those employees who were late on payments were more likely to be associated with a positive job performance.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(4) Further, there is no common standard among employers as to how to interpret credit reports, which reinforces the fact that credit reports do not provide meaningful insight into a candidate's character, responsibility, or prospective job performance.

     "(5) The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has stated that: 'Inquiry into an applicant's current or past assets, liabilities, or credit rating . . . generally should be avoided because they tend to impact more adversely on minorities and females.'"

    </p>
    <p>
     "(1) Pay inequity has been illegal since President Kennedy signed the Equal Pay Act in 1963 and Vermont outlawed pay discrimination in the Fair Employment Act the same year. In 1965, President Johnson signed Executive Order 11246, which requires federal contractors to certify their compliance with federal nondiscrimination laws, including the Equal Pay Act.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) Notwithstanding these laws and notwithstanding the fact that women today make up nearly half of the workforce, pay inequity remains a persistent problem. Nationally, women earn roughly 78 percent of what their male counterparts earn. In Vermont, women fare only slightly better, earning roughly 84 cents per dollar earned by men, according to the National Partnership for Women and Families.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(3) Pay inequity affects all households. Nationally nearly 40 percent of mothers bring home the majority of their family's earnings, and nearly 63 percent of mothers bring home at least a quarter of their family's income.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(4) Research has shown that pay inequity may arise even if an employer does not specifically intend to discriminate against workers based on sex. For example, some employees may not have a fair opportunity to negotiate pay because they lack the opportunity to know what similarly situated employees earn. Other employees may avoid or be channeled into lower-paying assignments or career paths that are viewed as more compatible with family needs. Other employees may temporarily drop out of the workforce because there is insufficient workplace flexibility; when such employees do return to the workforce, they may be unable to catch up to employees performing the same work.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(5) A number of European countries, such as Great Britain, France, and Germany, have successfully implemented laws that grant employees the right to ask for flexible workplace arrangements without fear of retaliation and that require employers to consider such requests in good faith. Employers with flexible, family-friendly policies tend to have lower rates of absenteeism, lower rates of employee turnover, and higher worker productivity.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(6) Research has also shown that short paid parental leaves tend to keep women in the labor force longer and that women who take such leaves tend not to earn less than their male counterparts."

     The Fair Employment Practices Act's handicap discrimination provisions were modeled on federal legislation; therefore, federal case law and regulations provide guidelines for construing them. Lowell v. International Business Machines Corp., 955 F. Supp. 300 (D. Vt. 1997).
    </p>
    <p>
     Vermont's Fair Employment Practices Act is patterned on Title VII, and the legal analysis to be followed derives from McDonnell Douglas Corporation v. Green, 411 U.S. 792, 93 S. Ct. 1817, 36 L. Ed. 2d 668 (1973). Violette v. International Business Machines Corp., 962 F. Supp. 446 (D. Vt. 1996), aff'd, 116 F.3d 466 (2d Cir. 1997).

     It is appropriate for court to look to federal law arising under Title VII of Civil Rights Act of 1964 and section 504 of Rehabilitation Act in interpreting provisions of this subchapter concerning discrimination against handicapped individuals. Mancini v. General Electric Co.,, 820 F. Supp. 141 (D. Vt. 1993).
    </p>
    <p>
     Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, after which the Fair Employment Practices Act is patterned, when plaintiff proves that a discriminatory reason, such as gender, played a motivating factor in an employment decision, the burden of persuasion then falls upon, and remains with, the employer to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it would have made the same decision even if it had not taken plaintiff's gender into account. Graff v. Eaton, 157 Vt. 321, 598 A.2d 1383 (1991).

    </h5>
    <p>
     In order for a plaintiff to prevail on a hostile environment sexual harassment claim under this chapter the plaintiff must prove that the harassment was sufficiently severe or pervasive to alter the conditions of the victim's employment and create an abusive working environment and the plaintiff must show that a specific basis exists for imputing the conduct that created the hostile environment to the employer. Perry v. Ethan Allen, Inc., 115 F.3d 143 (2d Cir. 1997).
    </p>
    <p>
     Although the jury found that plaintiff established that she had been sexually harassed through exposure to a hostile work environment, her claim failed because she was unable to demonstrate that management failed to implement prompt and appropriate corrective action in response to her complaint. Perry v. Ethan Allen, Inc., 115 F.3d 143 (2d Cir. 1997).

      4. Jury instructions.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     Trial judge properly instructed jury that in order to find intentional discrimination, jury had to find that plaintiff's physical impairment was a motivating factor in her termination. Knapp v. State, 168 Vt. 590, 729 A.2d 719 (mem.) (1998).
    </p>
    <p>
     Trial judge failed to properly instruct jury as to shifting burdens of proof in employment discrimination case based on handicap; jury should have been instructed that if plaintiff showed that her handicap was a motivating factor in her termination, her employer then had to prove that it would have made same decision even absent discriminatory motive. Knapp v. State, 168 Vt. 590, 729 A.2d 719 (mem.) (1998).
    </p>
    <p>
     At trial for discrimination on the basis of gender, court erred by not instructing jury that, if it were to find plaintiff had shown that gender was a motivating factor in the employment decision, then defendants had to prove that they would have made the same decision even absent the discriminatory motive. Graff v. Eaton, 157 Vt. 321, 598 A.2d 1383 (1991).
    </p>
    <p>
     At trial for discrimination on the basis of gender, where plaintiff was offered an editor's position but declined the position because of defendant's refusal to grant plaintiff a flextime work schedule, and plaintiff presented evidence that gender was a motivating factor in defendant's decision not to hire her, but court failed to instruct the jury as to defendant's burden of proof that they would have made the same decision even absent the discriminatory motive, case was reversed and remanded, since jury had to determine whether the evidence offered by plaintiff was credible and whether it played a motivating role in the employment decision. Graff v. Eaton, 157 Vt. 321, 598 A.2d 1383 (1991).

    </p>
    <p>
     In handicap and sex-discrimination action brought under this subchapter, plaintiff was not entitled to trial by jury where complaint requested "back pay, restitution of wages, and other benefits including salary increases, costs, reasonable attorney fees and such other relief as the court deems just and proper"; complaint listed only equitable forms of relief and "other relief that the court deems just and proper" could not be construed to include legal damages. Hodgdon v. Mt. Mansfield Co., 160 Vt. 150, 624 A.2d 1122 (1992).

     Vermont Fair Employment Practices Act actions are not barred by the exclusivity provision of the Workers' Compensation Act. Gallipo v. City of Rutland, 173 Vt. 223, 789 A.2d 942 (2001).
    </p>
    <p>
     Because an employer can take actions against an employee, producing mental injury and motivated in part by unlawful discrimination, without having the specific intent to injure the employee, it was not inconsistent for plaintiff to claim that he was injured by an accident for workers' compensation purposes and to also claim he was injured by unlawful discrimination. Gallipo v. City of Rutland, 173 Vt. 223, 789 A.2d 942 (2001).

     Superior court acted correctly in dismissing plaintiff firefighter's discrimination action against fire chief under the Vermont Fair Employment Practices Act because statute pertaining to actions by or against municipal officers required that the action be brought against the city.

        643b, 710 because those claims, though based on disability status and retaliation, were not totally unrelated to the FLSA claims, and adjudication of these state law claims was apt to require many of the same witnesses, much of the same evidence, and determination of many of the same facts.

        College professor failed to show that she was terminated on the basis of her Japanese national origin in violation of the Vermont Fair Employment Practices Act because her prior work evaluations were not consistently positive, there was no evidence of national origin bias, or that prior negative performance evaluations were unfair, negative comments from people not meaningfully involved in the review process did not show bias, and there was no pattern of disparate treatment, particularly as less than two years after the professor's termination, a Japanese-American was promoted to program director. Hiramoto v. Goddard College Corp., 184 F. Supp. 3d 84 (D. Vt. 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        When viewed in its entirety, the trial court's decision in an action under the Vermont Fair Employment Practices Act revealed that the trial court applied the proper burden of proof. It explained that following the establishment of plaintiffs' prima facie case, the burden rested on the State as the employer to prove that the wage disparity was not sex-linked and that once this burden had been met, plaintiffs could offer evidence that the proffered justification was pretext, but it underscored that this did not shift the burden of proof. Vt. Human Rights Comm'n v. State, 201 Vt. 62, 136 A.3d 188 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        The standards and burdens of proof to be applied under the Vermont Fair Employment Practices Act are identical to those applied under Title VII of the United States Civil Rights Act of 1964. Robertson v. Mylan Labs., Inc., 176 Vt. 356, 848 A.2d 310 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the absence of direct evidence of unlawful discrimination, a three-step burden-shifting analysis of Fair Employment Practices Act claims is applied: this requires plaintiff to make an initial showing of circumstantial evidence creating a presumption of illegal discrimination by the defendant; the burden then shifts to defendant to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the adverse employment action; and, if the employer meets this burden of production, the final stage of the analysis shifts the burden of production back to plaintiff to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons given by the employer are a pretext for discrimination. Boulton v. CLD Consulting Engineers, Inc., 175 Vt. 413, 834 A.2d 37 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because trial court found that plaintiff was reliable, knowledgeable and met or exceeded expectations for his position, and employer did not contest that plaintiff was qualified for position, plaintiff satisfied light burden of proof applicable to a prima facie case of age discrimination. Carpenter v. Central Vermont Medical Center, 170 Vt. 565, 743 A.2d 592 (mem.) (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Employee who was transferred to another position and then terminated, following affair with plant manager, failed to establish a prima facie case of employment discrimination or of retaliation, and also failed to rebut employer's legitimate nondiscriminatory reasons for its actions. Forant v. Cabot Creamery Coop., 74 F. Supp. 2d 415 (D. Vt. 1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        To establish a prima facie case of gender discrimination, a female plaintiff must show that she was qualified for the position, that her employer discharged her, and that the employer sought or hired a male to replace her. Cook v. Arrowsmith Shelburne, Inc., 69 F.3d 1235 (2d Cir. 1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a plaintiff's evidentiary proffer meets the requirements for a prima facie case, the burden of production to offer a legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the discharge falls on the employer, while the burden of persuasion on the whole case remains with the plaintiff. Cook v. Arrowsmith Shelburne, Inc., 69 F.3d 1235 (2d Cir. 1995).

        To prove retaliatory discrimination in violation of this section, plaintiff must initially prove a prima facie case of discrimination; then the burden shifts to the defendant to articulate some legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for the conduct; if defendant so articulates, plaintiff must prove that those reasons are a mere pretext. Sprague v. University of Vermont, 661 F. Supp. 1132 (D. Vt. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        In case involving an allegation of retaliatory discharge, the plaintiff has the initial burden of proving by the preponderance of the evidence a prima facie case of discrimination; if plaintiff succeeds in proving his or her prima facie case, the burden of production of evidence then shifts to the defendant to articulate some legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the alleged retaliatory conduct; if the defendant succeeds in carrying this burden, the plaintiff must then have an opportunity to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the legitimate reasons offered by the defendant were not its true reasons, but were a pretext for discrimination.

        In a case involving an alleged retaliatory discharge, the ultimate burden of persuading the trier of fact that the defendant intentionally discriminated against the plaintiff remains at all times with the plaintiff. Cobb v. Dufresne-Henry, Inc., 603 F. Supp. 1048 (D. Vt. 1985).

       <p>
        In retaliatory discharge cases, a plaintiff must prove, through admissible evidence presented at trial, that (1) he or she was engaged in a protected activity; (2) he or she was discharged; and (3) there was a causal connection between the participation in the protected activity and the discharge. Cobb v. Dufresne-Henry, Inc., 603 F. Supp. 1048 (D. Vt. 1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        In retaliatory discharge cases, if the defendant challenges causation, either by introducing evidence of no causal link, or of other cause, the burden is on the plaintiff to show that, but for the protected activity, no action would have taken place; the employee need not prove that his or her activity was the sole basis for the employer's action, but the employee must prove that but for the activity, he or she would not have been fired. Cobb v. Dufresne-Henry, Inc., 603 F. Supp. 1048 (D. Vt. 1985).

        In an action under this section for discrimination in hiring on basis of sex, the critical questions are whether the plaintiff has established a prima facie case of discrimination and, if so, whether the employer's evidence is sufficient to establish some legitimate nondiscriminatory reason for refusal to hire. State v. Whitingham School Board, 138 Vt. 15, 410 A.2d 996 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a sex discrimination in hiring action under this section, the plaintiff must establish that one discriminated against belonged to a protected minority, applied for and was qualified for a job opening, was rejected, and that the employer continued to seek applicants having qualifications like the rejected person, and after such prima facie case is established, the employer has the burden of showing its decision was based on a legitimate consideration not condemnable as discriminatory under the law, after which the plaintiff must be afforded an opportunity to show that the justification put forth by employer is merely a pretext. State v. Whitingham School Board, 138 Vt. 15, 410 A.2d 996 (1979).

        Under the language of the collective bargaining agreement, a male employee's movement to business manager was a promotion, not a new hire, so that the provision allowing the raising of incumbents' salaries did not apply, and the increases in his salary, including the one connected to his promotion, were for a bona fide reason other than sex, namely, the State's merit and seniority policies. Vt. Human Rights Comm'n v. State, 201 Vt. 62, 136 A.3d 188 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiffs' assertions showed that a hire-into-range policy was not followed exactly, but failed to show either that the policy was applied unreasonably or inconsistently with its terms or that any shortcomings resulted in a process based on a "bona fide factor other than sex." The stated purpose of the policy was to provide a mechanism to hire candidates when there was a shortage of applicants, when an applicant had special qualifications, or when an applicant possessed unique credentials exceeding other applicants, and the State relied on all of these reasons and provided a sufficient basis for each. Vt. Human Rights Comm'n v. State, 201 Vt. 62, 136 A.3d 188 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        State showed that the difference in wages was due to a "bona fide factor other than sex" when it presented evidence to demonstrate that a male employee's higher starting salary was justified based on his relevant education and extensive related experience, as well as business exigencies existing at the time based on its need to timely and efficiently have a new correctional facility's food service functions operational. Vt. Human Rights Comm'n v. State, 201 Vt. 62, 136 A.3d 188 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no showing of perpetuation of a sex-based differential in compensation. There was no support in the statutory language for plaintiffs' contention that if a hire resulted in a male being paid more than a female, then a sex-based wage differential was perpetuated and the reason was not bona fide; furthermore, there was no evidence that a male employee's hire and the factors considered as part of the hire-in-range process; experience, education, and business needs, perpetuated wage differentials generally or that the hire perpetuated wage disparity insofar as his higher starting salary was not higher than any female incumbent with similar work history or education. Vt. Human Rights Comm'n v. State, 201 Vt. 62, 136 A.3d 188 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        When an employer relies on a policy to explain its defense to an equal pay act violation, it must demonstrate that the policy was used reasonably; therefore, it is a question of law whether the facts indicate that the policy was implemented reasonably. Here, it was reasonable for the State under its hire-into-range policy to interpret three applicants as a shortage of qualified applicants for the position. Vt. Human Rights Comm'n v. State, 201 Vt. 62, 136 A.3d 188 (2015).

        In a mixed-motive gender discrimination case brought by plaintiff, a discharged state trooper, under the Vermont Fair Employment Practices Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, plaintiff failed to allege that she was prejudiced by the trial court's refusal to consider the allegations in her complaint to the Human Rights Commission because she had not sworn to the truth of its contents. Moreover, even if the complaint were considered, it was based largely on "information and belief," inadmissible hearsay, and conclusory allegations insufficient to provide a factual basis to evaluate the claim of improper motivation. Lamay v. State, 191 Vt. 635, 49 A.3d 559 (mem.) (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff, a discharged former state trooper, had not established mixed-motive gender discrimination under the Vermont Fair Employment Practices Act and Title VII. The remarks attributed to plaintiff's supervisor were essentially descriptive of actual problems plaintiff had with childcare and did not convey invidious gender stereotyping; plaintiff had not shown that the complaining prosecutor was either aware of a male state trooper's alleged misstatements or referred the matter to plaintiff's supervisor; plaintiff had not shown that she and a male trooper who was not compelled to live near assigned barracks were similarly situated; there was no clear proof that another trooper was neither investigated nor disciplined as plaintiff claimed; and as for plaintiff's claim of disparate treatment in being disciplined for asking another officer to dispose of marijuana, the issue was not whether other troopers failed to follow the rule in question, but how they were treated where, as here, the violation was reported by a fellow trooper.

        Where plaintiff was a qualified female engineer who lost her managerial position and was replaced by a male manager, she made a prima facie showing of gender discrimination and defendant company then had the burden of production to demonstrate that it had legitimate, nondiscriminatory reasons for removing plaintiff from her position as branch manager.

       </p>
       <p>

        Pregnancy discrimination can be sex discrimination under the Vermont Fair Employment Practices Act. Pregnancy is a condition unique to women, and the ability to become pregnant is a primary characteristic of the female sex. Thus any classification which relies on pregnancy as the determinative criterion is a distinction based on sex. Lavalley v. E.B. & A.C. Whiting Co., 166 Vt. 205, 692 A.2d 367 (1997).

        Employer's policy - under which workers with nonwork-related long-term disabilities that rendered them unable to substantially perform their responsibilities were placed on disability leave at fifty percent of salary, as opposed to workers with work-related disabilities, who were encouraged to accept accommodations, including alternative work, and who received full pay - did not specifically condition any employment or benefit rule on pregnancy and was facially neutral and affected pregnant women because their temporary disability, and those of others both male and female, was not work related. This policy distinction is fundamentally rooted in the workers' compensation laws. Lavalley v. E.B. & A.C. Whiting Co., 166 Vt. 205, 692 A.2d 367 (1997).

        In sex discrimination in hiring action, where lower court treated as irrelevant the employer's comparison of complainant and person hired with respect to background, qualifications and experience and employer's claim it hired the person with the superior qualifications, the court erroneously ignored the most basic legitimate nondiscriminatory consideration for a hiring decision and should have focused on whether that consideration was a mere pretext for impermissible discrimination, and cause, which resulted below in order that complainant be hired, would be remanded for new hearing and evaluation of the evidence.

         14. Damages.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Employer failed in its challenge to the amount of damages in an age discrimination case brought by a job applicant. It would have been entirely speculative for the jury to have made an offset to reflect additional income evidence; the evidence on mitigation was sparse and inconclusive; the front pay period was not too speculative in that an expert witness explained how he derived his prediction of the applicant's employment duration in relation to the population for his age group and education; and there was no evidence that the verdict included attorney's fees. Spooner v. Town of Topsham, 186 Vt. 527, 973 A.2d 1202 (mem.) (2009).

     <p>
      (2) Any charge or formal complaint filed by the Attorney General or a State's Attorney against a person for unlawful discrimination or sexual harassment in violation of the provisions of this chapter shall include a statement setting forth the prohibition against retaliation pursuant to subdivision 495(a)(8) of this title.

        Since sections 2458-2461 of Title 9, incorporated by reference in subsection (a) of this section, expressly authorize attorney's fees for plaintiffs and the state, but do not mention an award for defendants, the omission supports the inference that the legislature intended to exclude employers from attorney's fees under this section.

        Neither section 2458 nor section 2461 of Title 9, the provisions of the consumer fraud act relating to recovery of litigation expenses and attorney fees by the state and by plaintiffs which are incorporated by reference in subsection (a) of this section, authorize attorney's fees to a prevailing defendant.

       <p>
        Language in subsection (a) of this section that any employer, employment agency or labor organization complained against shall have the same rights and remedies as specified in sections 2459-2461 of Title 9 cannot be interpreted as granting employers the identical opportunity for attorney's fees afforded plaintiffs and the state by sections 2458 and 2461 of Title 9, since such construction runs counter to the plain meaning of those sections, which expressly authorize attorney's fees for plaintiffs and the state, but do not mention an award for defendants.

        A plaintiff may seek both legal and equitable relief when making a claim under the Vermont Fair Employment Practices Act. Gadbois v. Rock-Tenn Co., Mill Div., Inc., 984 F. Supp. 811 (D. Vt. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Complete denial of all fees for a second attorney was an abuse of discretion because the record did not support a finding that all fees for the second attorney were unreasonable. Apart from implying that plaintiff's fees were excessive because of the use of multiple attorneys, the trial court provided no findings or analysis as to how the second attorney's services were duplicative, nor did the trial court explain why it did not award fees for work that the second attorney did that did not involve familiarizing himself with the facts and law that the first attorney already knew. Spooner v. Town of Topsham, 188 Vt. 293, 9 A.3d 672 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Consideration that a reasonable client would wish to pay the lowest possible hourly rate to litigate a case effectively is just one factor among others that courts should bear in mind when determining reasonableness. Furthermore, in denying a request for fees for an interlocutory appeal under the Fair Employment Practices Act, the trial court offered no explanation as to why a reasonable client would not be willing to pay for the interlocutory appeal, and the court did not find any evidence in the record to support such a conclusion. Spooner v. Town of Topsham, 188 Vt. 293, 9 A.3d 672 (2010).

       </h5>
       <p>
        In denying plaintiff fees and costs connected with an interlocutory appeal under the Fair Employment Practices Act, the trial court's conclusion that the need for the interlocutory appeal process was "debatable" was not a finding of unreasonableness. In order to deny attorney's fees for the interlocutory appeal, the trial court was required to find that pursuit of the interlocutory appeal was unreasonable, not that it was "debatable." Spooner v. Town of Topsham, 188 Vt. 293, 9 A.3d 672 (2010).

         8. Third party instigating additional costs.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Nothing in the Fair Employment Practices Act that provides an exception to the fee-shifting provision based on whether a third party instigated additional litigation costs. In a suit by a job applicant against a town, the applicant's interlocutory appeal was a necessary portion of the trial in which the town was found to have engaged in discriminatory hiring practices; thus, the fact that it was a witness, and not the town itself, who filed a motion to quash did not mean that the town should not pay the fees and costs for the interlocutory appeal. Spooner v. Town of Topsham, 188 Vt. 293, 9 A.3d 672 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case where plaintiff sought fees and costs connected with filing an interlocutory appeal under the Fair Employment Practices Act to compel the testimony of a witness, there was no basis in the record for finding that plaintiff's strategy was unreasonable. Rather, in ruling that the witness's subpoena could not be quashed, the appellate court necessarily held that his testimony was important to the case; thus, it was an abuse of discretion for the trial court to conclude that the interlocutory appeal was unnecessary and produced evidence of "debatable" import. Spooner v. Town of Topsham, 188 Vt. 293, 9 A.3d 672 (2010).

        Issues decided by arbitrator in employment discrimination action were based on provisions of collective bargaining agreement and were not the same as those which would be decided under Vermont Fair Employment Practices Act: collateral estoppel therefore did not apply to arbitrator's decision. Latouche v. North Country Union High School District, 131 F. Supp. 2d 568 (D. Vt. 2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff's emotional condition was not a handicap which could reasonably be accommodated within meaning of this subchapter, and employer was entitled to summary judgment on discrimination claim; ability to follow orders is an essential function of any job, uncontested facts indicated that plaintiff was insubordinate on several occasions, and employer was not obligated to transfer plaintiff to another work area to avoid contact with supervisor. Mancini v. General Electric Co.,, 820 F. Supp. 141 (D. Vt. 1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although plaintiff's lack of upper teeth did not substantially limit her in any major life activity, she was nevertheless a handicapped individual under this subchapter where her employer decided that the visible physical impairment rendered her unfit to fill a position in which she had some contact with employer's guests. Hodgdon v. Mt. Mansfield Co., 160 Vt. 150, 624 A.2d 1122 (1992).

       <p>
        Plaintiff's claimed impairment, ulcerative colitis, which had lasted for at least five months and was the result of a long-term illness that required three separate surgeries, could not be found, as a matter of law, too fleeting to be covered by this subchapter. Potvin v. Champlain Cable Corp., 165 Vt. 504, 687 A.2d 95 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Lack of upper teeth is a physical impairment within the meaning of this subchapter because it is a cosmetic disfigurement and an anatomical loss affecting the musculoskeletal and digestive systems. Hodgdon v. Mt. Mansfield Co., 160 Vt. 150, 624 A.2d 1122 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        When an employer makes an employment decision based on its belief that an employee with a visible physical impairment is not fit to work in a position involving any customer contact, then the employer has treated the impairment as substantially limiting the employee's ability to work; in such circumstances, the employee is a handicapped individual under this subchapter. Hodgdon v. Mt. Mansfield Co., 160 Vt. 150, 624 A.2d 1122 (1992).

       <p>
        Relevant time for assessing whether an employee is capable of performing essential functions of her job is when accommodation is requested. Decker v. Vermont Educational Television, Inc., 13 F. Supp. 2d 569 (D. Vt. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        In any handicapped-discrimination claim brought under the Fair Employment Practices Act, the first issue is whether plaintiff is a handicapped individual as defined by subdivision (5) of this section. Potvin v. Champlain Cable Corp., 165 Vt. 504, 687 A.2d 95 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        To make a successful discrimination claim, plaintiff had to show not only that she was a handicapped individual, but that she was a "qualified handicapped individual" entitled to the protection of this subchapter; a "qualified handicapped individual" is a person who can perform the "essential functions of the job...with reasonable accommodation to his handicap." Potvin v. Champlain Cable Corp., 165 Vt. 504, 687 A.2d 95 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Determining whether employee satisfies definition of a "qualified handicapped individual" requires two distinct determinations: what constitutes the essential functions of the job and what constitutes reasonable accommodation. State v. G.S. Blodgett Co., 163 Vt. 175, 656 A.2d 984 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        While employers should conduct an individualized inquiry to determine whether a handicapped employee requires an accommodation in order to advance the goals of 21 V.S.A.
        §
        495d(6), there is no authority imposing liability for failure to conduct an adequate inquiry; liability attaches only when an employer discriminates against a qualified handicapped individual. State v. G.S. Blodgett Co., 163 Vt. 175, 656 A.2d 984 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a court concludes that plaintiff is not a qualified handicapped individual, there is no actionable claim for discrimination under 21 V.S.A.
        §
        495(a)(1). State v. G.S. Blodgett Co., 163 Vt. 175, 656 A.2d 984 (1995).

        Definition of employer does not contain a requirement that to be an employer one must have the power to fire. Fernot v. Crafts Inn, Inc., 895 F. Supp. 668 (D. Vt. 1995).
       </p>

        495d(6)(A), alleging that the hospital failed to accommodate his heart condition by permitting the psychiatrist to work part time with no call duty was denied because the psychiatrist presented sufficient evidence for a reasonable juror to conclude that call duty was not an essential job function where the psychiatrist showed instances where a doctor would take "first call" but another doctor would go in to the hospital if needed, and the hospital apparently permitted at least one staff psychiatrist to eliminate call duty when she moved a greater distance from the medical facility. Mueller v. Rutland Mental Health Services, Inc., - F. Supp. 2d - (D. Vt. Aug. 17, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Summary judgment was appropriate in handicapped discrimination action brought under Vermont's Fair Employment Practices Act because there were no genuine issues of material fact suggesting that employee was capable of performing the essential functions of a general helper with or without reasonable accommodation. State v. G.S. Blodgett Co., 163 Vt. 175, 656 A.2d 984 (1995).

        When employee with multiple sclerosis asked for reinstatement, wiring was no longer performed by employer's employees, and, therefore, wiring could not be considered an essential function of

        Fact that testimony indicated that coemployee was always making sexual remarks and regularly leered at employee, rather than giving specific dates, did not negate its role in establishing a work environment of sufficiently pervasive sexual harassment.

        Although employer argued that former employee's sworn statement in Social Security proceeding that she was physically incapable of performing the job of general helper was dispositive on the issue of whether employee was qualified under 21 V.S.A.
        §
        495(a)(1), employee's statements could not be dispositive on the issue of whether she was a qualified handicapped individual because they were made without regard for the essential functions of the job and whether reasonable accommodations would enable her to perform the job; however, they were probative of her job-related capabilities and the severity of her handicap.

        The reasonable accommodation an employer must make for an employee's disability does not include an obligation to transfer that employee solely to allow him to work under a different supervisor. Brace v. International Business Machines Corp., 953 F. Supp. 561 (D. Vt. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        In handicapped discrimination action, plaintiffs failed to present evidence that a reasonable accommodation was possible where plaintiffs' proposals envisioned eliminating all of the present functions of a general helper and reintroducing an obsolete employee function of wiring. State v. G.S. Blodgett Co., 163 Vt. 175, 656 A.2d 984 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        When an employer concludes that no accommodations are reasonable, that decision is tantamount to a determination that the employee is not a qualified handicapped individual within the meaning of 21 V.S.A.

      Notwithstanding any other provision of this subchapter, it is not unlawful discrimination on the basis of age or disability for any employer, employment agency or labor organization to observe the terms of a bona fide seniority system or any bona fide employee benefit plan, such as a retirement, pension, or life or health insurance plan, any of which is not a subterfuge to evade the purposes of this subchapter. No employee benefit plan, however, excuses the failure to hire any individual. No seniority system or employee benefit plan shall require or permit the involuntary retirement of any individual because of age. Mandatory retirement on account of age, necessitated under a police or firefighter retirement system, is specifically authorized.

       <p>
        On the former employee's claim that the former employer terminated his employment in retaliation for his complaints about improper patient care practices, in violation of Vermont's Healthcare Whistleblower Protection Act, 21 V.S.A.
        §
        507, the employer articulated a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for the employee's termination because the employer cited evidence that surgical volume was declining, that various cost-saving measures were implemented which did not involve the employee, and that the employee's position was eliminated as part of the employer's effort to reduce costs in the peri-operative area in the face of declining surgical volume. Green v. Springfield Med. Care Sys., - F. Supp. 2d - (D. Vt. June 24, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        When an employee claimed that she had been terminated for "whistle-blowing," there was ample support in the record for the conclusion that her termination was caused by her insubordination, and not by her engaging in protected activities. The trial court found that she: (1) had multiple confrontations with her supervisors over the management hierarchy, (2) acted without regard to that hierarchy in several instances, (3) confronted a coworker about her supposed underqualification despite having no supervisory authority over the coworker, (4) failed to keep up with her original responsibilities, and (5) refused to invite or notify her supervisor to attend certain meetings in which the supervisor had expressed an interest.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In a case alleging that an employee's termination was in retaliation for "whistle-blowing," the trial court properly excluded evidence as irrelevant when it appeared to have been largely about events that occurred outside of the employee's tenure with the employer. Even if the excluded evidence were relevant, its exclusion would not be grounds for reversal unless the employee had demonstrated that its exclusion likely affected the outcome of the case, and she had made no such showing.

     Legislative findings and purpose.
    </b>
    <cite class="vt-code">2007, No. 208</cite> (Adj. Sess.),
    
     §
    
    1 provides: "(a) The General Assembly finds the following:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(1) The workers' compensation program was established in 1915 to dispense with the concept of negligence by providing compensation to any employee who is injured on the job and to limit employers' exposure to lawsuits for negligence in the workplace. In addition, this program removed the need for injured employees to rely on tax-funded public assistance programs.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) The National Council on Compensation Insurance, NCCI, the nation's largest provider of workers' compensation and employee injury data, recommends to the Vermont department of banking, insurance, securities, and health care administration proposed workers' compensation voluntary market loss costs and assigned risk market rates by classification codes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(3) In March 2008, the department of banking, insurance, securities, and health care administration approved an average 4.2 percent decrease in both the voluntary market loss costs and assigned risk market rates, representing the largest decrease in a decade. This decrease provided many Vermont employers, including sawmill, logging, and carpentry operations, hospitals, restaurants, and ski areas, with a modest decrease in their workers' compensation premiums. Other Vermont employers with good safety records may enjoy even higher premium rate reductions.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(4) The decrease is attributed mainly to a decline in workplace injuries. Two major cost drivers of workers' compensation premiums are the frequency of claims and the seriousness of claims. Another cost driver is medical costs which are increasing more rapidly than the rate of inflation. The duration of claims also adds to workers' compensation costs.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(5) Despite recent stability in workers' compensation rates, the comparatively high cost of workers' compensation insurance in Vermont remains an issue of great concern to many Vermont employers.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(6) The increased implementation of safety training programs and measures by Vermont employers has reduced the frequency of workplace injuries, which is the most effective way to reduce workers' compensation costs.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(7) The fact that only 8.5 percent of the Vermont employers are in the residual market validates that workers' compensation insurers perceive that the Vermont workers' compensation program is working effectively. The residual market is less than half the size it was five years ago, indicating that many employers have found appropriate coverage in the voluntary market, in which employers can benefit from competition between carriers. The lack of competition among carriers for certain industries such as dairy farming presents a disadvantage for those industries.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(8) Workers' compensation premiums for farmers are increasing while premiums for most other employer categories are going down. Farming is inherently more hazardous than many other industries, and the pool of farmers to spread the risk is small. Agricultural workers have a higher frequency and suffer more serious work injuries than other workers, particularly those working on farms with hoofed animals.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(9) It is important to provide incentives to improve farm safety through comprehensive training programs. Extensive outreach and safety education will go a long way toward reducing workers' compensation premium rates for farmers. The Vermont farm bureau, the agency of agriculture, food and markets, the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the University of Vermont extension service, and other organizations are working to develop enhanced farm safety training programs.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(10) A significant number of employers are improperly classifying employees as "independent contractors" either due to a lack of understanding or knowingly to avoid legal obligations under federal and state labor and tax laws governing payment of wages, unemployment insurance, workers' compensation, and income and social security taxation.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(11) Misclassification of employees as 'independent contractors' adversely impacts the Vermont economy because it deprives workers of legal protections and benefits; reduces compliance with employment and safety standards; gives employers who misclassify an improper financial competitive advantage over law-abiding businesses; deprives the state of substantial revenue; and imposes indirect costs from decreased legitimate business activity and increased demand for social services. A recent survey of workers' compensation insurers conducted in compliance with No. 57 of the Acts of 2007 reveals that misclassification is a significant problem that may add 10 to 20 percent or more to the cost of workers' compensation.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(12) Historically, compliance and enforcement have been divided among various governmental entities, which reduce efficiency and effectiveness. Improved cooperation, sharing information, and joint enforcement of serious violations would be effective approaches to reducing employer misclassification.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(13) While a reduction in workers' compensation benefits would lower workers' compensation premiums across all class codes, this reduction would be at the expense of injured workers and provide little incentive for improving safety.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(14) Significant delays in scheduling a hearing and issuing a decision after formal hearing in contested workers' compensation cases have an adverse impact on injured workers, who are often without necessary medical benefits or income for up to two years; on health care providers, who do not receive timely payment of medical bills; and on insurers, who must maintain reserves on open and unresolved claims.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(b) Therefore, it is the purpose of this act to address the problems of employee misclassification and miscoding, improve farm safety, and make other positive changes to the workers' compensation laws that are intended to improve the efficiency of dispute resolution and reduce the cost of workers' compensation."

     Although the statutory definition of "wages" in the Workers Compensation Act did not mention employer-paid health insurance premiums, as the statutory phrase "other advantages which can be estimated in money" was ambiguous and capable of more than one reasonable interpretation, it was proper to attempt to discern the Legislature's intent by other means and by looking to the legislative history. Lydy v. Trustaff, Inc., 194 Vt. 165, 76 A.3d 150 (2013).
    </p>
    <p>
     As an employer's cost in providing health insurance measured neither the employee's benefit nor his compensation because the costs were not tied to the employee's labors but instead, were based on factors unconnected to the employee, the employer's contribution for health insurance, though determinable, did not accurately reflect the employee's labors or compensation as defined through wages for purposes of the Workers' Compensation Act. Lydy v. Trustaff, Inc., 194 Vt. 165, 76 A.3d 150 (2013).
    </p>
    <p>
     As there was a split of authority with respect to whether fringe benefits were wages for the purpose of workers' compensation, and against the backdrop of Vermont Department of Labor's consistent interpretation of its own statute, other states' decisions were not compelling.

        The Legislature, in enacting the predecessor to the definition of employer set forth in subdivision (3) of this section, wanted (1) to protect employees of independent contractors and subcontractors who were not financially responsible and (2) to prevent owners of trades or businesses or general contractors from relieving themselves of liability under this chapter by doing through independent contractors what they would otherwise do through their direct employees. King v. Snide, 144 Vt. 395, 479 A.2d 752 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislative intent of subdivision (3) of this section was to impose liability only upon the owner or proprietor of a regular trade or business conducted on his premises, or the premises of another, where an uninsured independent contractor is carrying out some phase of the owner's or operator's business. King v. Snide, 144 Vt. 395, 479 A.2d 752 (1984).

        Subdivision (3) of this section in effect creates a statutory relationship of employer and employee, where no such relationship existed at common law. King v. Snide, 144 Vt. 395, 479 A.2d 752 (1984).

        Vermont Agency of Human Services was not the statutory employer of a claimant who provided nursing care to a child in his home. The Agency's sole function was to administer a public welfare Medicaid program, while the claimant's business was actual provision of nursing care in return for Medicaid payments. Marcum v. State Agency of Human Servs., 191 Vt. 573, 38 A.3d 1177 (mem.) (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Owners of the building where a decedent had worked as a funeral director were not statutory employers, as nothing showed that they were engaged in the funeral home business in their capacity as property owners. The fact that the landlord entities and the funeral home business had overlapping personnel was not dispositive. Arnold v. Palmer, 189 Vt. 608, 19 A.3d 592 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        A cleaning service, that was hired to clean the offices of a worker's employer, a utility company, was not the worker's statutory employer. The worker was an employee of the utility, which employed the cleaning service to perform an entirely unrelated function that was relatively peripheral to its central business of generating and transmitting electricity. Smedberg v. Detlef's Custodial Service, Inc., 182 Vt. 349, 940 A.2d 674 (Sept. 21, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because subsection (3) of this section contemplates a broader definition of employer than that established by the common law, that definition may, under certain circumstances, include indirect corporate employers; nonetheless, the commissioner is not precluded by any jurisdictional barrier from finding a statutory employer relationship under such circumstances. Frazier v. Preferred Operators, Inc., 177 Vt. 571, 861 A.2d 1130 (mem.) (September 24, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where stipulated facts showed that claimant's employer was being operated to carry out some phase of the business of the lumberyard where plaintiff was injured, the Commissioner did not err in concluding that the lumberyard was claimant's statutory employer under subsection (3) of this section and case law applying the nature-of-the-business test. Frazier v. Preferred Operators, Inc., 177 Vt. 571, 861 A.2d 1130 (mem.) (September 24, 2004).

        Defendant, a commercial landlord, failed in its argument that, by agreeing to keep its premises safe, it assumed the duty of plaintiff's employer to provide a safe workplace, and thus was immunized from tort suits; plaintiff's action did not concern a suit against someone directly involved in the employer's business operations, and defendant's duty to maintain the premises was not the same as the employer's duty to provide a safe workplace for its employees because it is the kind of independent, personal duty that is inconsistent with the status of a "virtual employer."

        In a workers' compensation case involving a left-shoulder injury, the expert testimony as well as the claimant's testimony by the time of the hearing that she was able to work much longer hours than in the summer of 2005 supported the finding that the claimant had not reached a medical end result by July 2005. Furthermore, even in the absence of surgery during that period, the claimant made significant improvement in the range of motion of both shoulders after July 2005, and the record revealed that she reasonably declined to have surgery on her left shoulder during the six-month period following the surgery on her right shoulder. Brace v. Vergennes Auto, Inc., 186 Vt. 542, 978 A.2d 441 (mem.) (2009).

       <p>
        Under the doctrine of primary jurisdiction, the trial court had jurisdiction to determine whether an employee had waived his right to bring suit against his employers by making a binding election to claim workers' compensation. The issue involved statutory construction, a pure question of law, and the Commissioner of Labor had no particular expertise in adjudicating that question. Smith v. Desautels, 183 Vt. 255, 953 A.2d 620 (Mar. 7, 2008).

       </p>

       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in instructing the jury to determine whether plaintiff's stress was unusual as compared with the general population of employees, rather than with all other employees performing similar work. Crosby v. City of Burlington, 176 Vt. 239, 844 A.2d 722 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Commissioner's standard for mental injury workers' compensation claims (i.e., in order for mental injury caused by stress at work to be compensable, a claimant must show that the stresses at work were of a significantly greater dimension than the daily stresses encountered by all employees) is supported by the following reasonable policy concerns: (1) a mental injury could have resulted from such diverse factors as social environment, culture, heredity, age, sex, family relationships, and other interpersonal relationship, as well as employment, a high degree of uncertainty exists in the diagnosis of cause; (2) greater objectivity is necessary in mental injury cases because the claimant's subjective impression that work-related stress caused her injury often forms the basis for the medical opinion that the injury was caused primarily by work-related stress; and (3) the Commissioner's standard protects against nondetectable fraudulent claims and prevents the conversion of workers' compensation into general health insurance. Bedini v. Frost, 165 Vt. 167, 678 A.2d 893 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the Workers' Compensation Act does not expressly differentiate between physical and mental injuries, the Commissioner has properly adopted a standard that does so because of the greater uncertainty in the diagnosis of mental injuries than in the diagnosis of physical injuries. Bedini v. Frost, 165 Vt. 167, 678 A.2d 893 (1996).

        An injury need not be instantaneous to be accidental within the meaning of this section. Campbell v. Heinrich Savelberg, Inc., 139 Vt. 31, 421 A.2d 1291 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Four to six weeks' exposure to intense fumes in the workplace is a sufficiently specific trauma to constitute an accident within the meaning of this section; the injury need not be a specific brief event. Campbell v. Heinrich Savelberg, Inc., 139 Vt. 31, 421 A.2d 1291 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where exposure to heavy paint and varnish fumes in the workplace aggravated chronic bronchitis and constituted a new injury to the mucosa lining the bronchial tubes, which caused severe swelling and fluid production that brought on rapid change from relatively stable chronic bronchitis to acute bronchitis, and where such injury in turn diminished heart's oxygen supply and brought on a myocardial infarction, there was a personal injury; and that exposure to fumes was over extended period of time did not keep what occurred from being an accident. Campbell v. Heinrich Savelberg, Inc., 139 Vt. 31, 421 A.2d 1291 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        The word "accident," as used in this section, means an unlooked-for mishap or an untoward event which is not expected or designed. Giguere v. E. B. & A. C. Whiting Co., 107 Vt. 151, 177 A. 313 (1935); Masterson v. Rutland Hospital, 129 Vt. 91, 271 A.2d 848 (1970), overruled on other grounds, Campbell v. Heinrich Savelberg, Inc. (1980) 139 Vt. 31, 421 A.2d 1291; Campbell v. Heinrich Savelberg, Inc., 139 Vt. 31, 421 A.2d 1291 (1980).

        Where workman, while in course of his employment, and performing his regular duties of lifting trays of fiber weighing from 40 to 65 pounds each, suffered a left inguinal hernia, which was first hernia he had ever had, the hernia thus suffered was an "injury by accident" within meaning of this section.

        In a workers' compensation case, remand was required when the Commissioner of Labor had failed to make findings of fact with regard to the expert testimony and had never clearly ruled on the crucial question of whether the claimant's injury arose out of and in the course of employment. McNally v. Dep't of PATH, 189 Vt. 515, 13 A.3d 656 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        To have a compensable injury, workers' compensation claimant must prove both that accident (1) arose out of the employment, and (2) occurred in the course of the employment. Miller v. International Business Machines Corp., 161 Vt. 213, 637 A.2d 1072 (1993).

        As there are no hard and fast rules to determine when an injury arises out of employment, the outcome of each case is determined only after taking all the facts and circumstances into account. Shaw v. Dutton Berry Farm, 160 Vt. 594, 632 A.2d 18 (1993).

       <p>
        Ordinarily, if an injury occurs during the course of employment, it also arises out of it, unless the circumstances are so attenuated from the condition of employment that the cause of the injury cannot reasonably be related to the employment; even if the worker's activity leading to the injury is not work per se, the causal connection is not necessarily broken.

        For the purpose of analyzing whether an injury qualifies as an accidental personal injury arising out of and in the course of employment, claims have been divided into four general categories: (1) physical injury caused by physical stimulus; (2) physical injury caused by mental stimulus; (3) nervous injury caused by physical stimulus; and (4) nervous injury caused by mental stimulus.

        Workers' compensation claimant was put in a "positional-risk" situation when he was given a soda bottle at work that contained an industrial cleaning agent, which put the mechanism of his injury in motion; his consumption of the caustic chemicals several days later when he drank from the bottle at home followed logically from his receipt of the bottle of what he understood was a soft drink. Thus, his injury arose out of his employment, because but for his employment, the instrument of his injury would never have arrived in his hands. Cyr v.

        In proceeding for workmen's compensation, attending physician's report made three days after claimant allegedly tripped over a rock and was injured while on the job, stating that claimant had walked fast for two miles three weeks prior to the examination, and suffered pain after that, was competent evidence upon which lower court could find that claimant failed to show by the requisite burden of proof that her complaints arose out of and in the course of her employment.

        The purpose of Vt. Const. ch. II, art. 70, authorizing compensation laws, was to insulate pending workers' compensation laws from constitutional attack, not to prevent workers from obtaining benefits based on psychological injuries. Crosby v. City of Burlington, 176 Vt. 239, 844 A.2d 722 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Summary judgment was denied on an employee's claim that an insurer acted in bad faith in denying a claim for workers' compensation benefits where there were issues of fact as to whether the employee's injury was work-related under 21 V.S.A.
        §
        618(a)(1), and whether insurer knowingly and recklessly mishandled the employee's workers' compensation claim. Buote v. Verizon New Eng., 249 F. Supp. 2d 422 (D. Vt. 2003).

       <p>
        Because an employer can take actions against an employee, producing mental injury and motivated in part by unlawful discrimination, without having the specific intent to injure the employee, it was not inconsistent for plaintiff to claim that he was injured by an accident for workers' compensation purposes and to also claim he was injured by unlawful discrimination.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Nowhere does the workers' compensation subsection dealing with an employee's waiver of the right to pursue a civil action indicate that it is limited to voluntary payments. Indeed, it specifically applies to "any payment." Smith v. Desautels, 183 Vt. 255, 953 A.2d 620 (Mar. 7, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to deprive an employee of his right to sue, there must be strict compliance with the explicit requirements of the workers' compensation statute regarding waiver of the right to bring a civil action. Smith v. Desautels, 183 Vt. 255, 953 A.2d 620 (Mar. 7, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the Legislature passed the section of the workers' compensation statute regarding waiver of the right to bring a civil action to protect the worker's election remedy, an employer is still able to force an election by the worker as long as it is knowing and voluntary pursuant to the terms of the statute. Thus, before making any compensation payments, whether voluntarily or under the direction of the Department of Labor, the employer can insist that the worker waive the right to sue. Smith v. Desautels, 183 Vt. 255, 953 A.2d 620 (Mar. 7, 2008).

        Employer could offset the sick wages paid to a workers' compensation claimant during a period of temporary total disability against the workers' compensation disability benefits it was ordered to pay for the same period. The claimant received all statutory disability benefits to which he was entitled; the ban against assignment was inapposite; and the employer's offset-credit policy did not compromise in any way the claimant's opportunity to seek attorney's fee reimbursement.

        Statute applying to workers hired outside of Vermont does not entitle persons neither employed nor hired in Vermont to benefits under Vermont's workers' compensation statues, but rather requires the Commissioner of Labor to apply the workers' compensation schemes of other states in certain circumstances.

       <p>
        When a worker was neither employed nor hired in Vermont, the statute applying to workers hired outside of Vermont did not entitle him to transfer his New York workers' compensation case to Vermont and begin claiming Vermont benefits. That does not mean, however, that the Commissioner of Labor lacked jurisdiction to take his case; rather, the Commissioner and the trial court should have questioned whether his rights under New York law could be reasonably determined and dealt with in Vermont. Letourneau v. A.N. Deringer/Wausau Ins. Co., 184 Vt. 422, 966 A.2d 133 (2008).

       <p>
        Creation of a right "to enforce rights in this State" in the statute applying to workers hired outside of Vermont does not entitle workers not employed or hired in Vermont to Vermont workers' compensation benefits, but rather gives those workers the right to utilize Vermont's administrative and court systems to enforce their entitlement to benefits under other schemes - namely, the schemes of the states where they were hired. The question of whether workers' compensation benefits can reasonably be determined and dealt with in Vermont is a practical one that asks to what extent the Department of Labor and Vermont's courts can apply the laws of other states and administer benefits through their schemes. Letourneau v. A.N. Deringer/Wausau Ins. Co., 184 Vt. 422, 966 A.2d 133 (2008).

        The denial of loss of consortium claims under the exclusivity provision of the workers' compensation statute violates the common benefits clause of the Vermont Constitution; there is no rational basis for allowing an injured employee to bring a tort action against a third party while denying a loss of consortium claim by the employee's spouse.

        The exclusivity provision of the workers' compensation statute does not bar recovery for underinsured motorists (UIM) benefits from a self-insured employer because, as an employer, the company is also an insurer bound to provide UIM coverage on its motor vehicles and, when the employee seeks UIM payments from the employer, the employee is enforcing the employer's statutory obligation to provide UIM coverage irrespective of the method of insurance.

        Where State employee who received workers' compensation benefits for injuries sustained while performing his duties brought a negligence action against co-employees alleging that they failed to provide him with a safe and defect-free motor vehicle with which to perform his job, State's obligation under 3 V.S.A.
        §§
        1101-1104 to defend State employees did not make plaintiff's case into a suit against the State which would be barred by this section. Libercent v. Aldrich, 149 Vt. 76, 539 A.2d 981 (1987).
       </p>

        The 1959 amendment to section 624 of this title restored common law liability in favor of injured employee when injury is caused under circumstances where legal liability resides in stranger to contract of employment, even though employee may have received compensation under this chapter. Ryan v. New Bedford Cordage Co., 421 F. Supp. 794 (D. Vt. 1976), affirmed, 559 F.2d 1206 (2d Cir. 1977).

        To extent that provisions of this section making workmen's compensation exclusive remedy of injured employees are inconsistent with 1959 amendment to section 624 of this title, which restored common law liability in favor of injured employee against stranger to employment contract, even though injured workman may have received compensation under this chapter, provisions of amendment must prevail.

       <p>
        When defendant sold its assets to a second company and plaintiff began working for the second company, plaintiff had no relationship with defendant beyond that of a former employee. Thus, when plaintiff was injured two years later while using a switch designed by defendant, he was not injured "in the course of his employment" with defendant, and defendant was not his employer for purposes of workers' compensation exclusivity, but was "some person other than the employer." Hemond & Hemond v. Frontier Communications of Am., Inc., 192 Vt. 646 (mem.), 59 A.3d 766 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        With regard to whether plaintiff's claim was barred by the exclusivity provision of the Workers' Compensation Act, it was premature to grant summary judgment on the issue of the exceptions for intent or substantial certainty. Not only were the facts alleged by plaintiff susceptible to competing inferences, but defendant also conceded that material facts - whether a hard guard on a press existed and, if it did, whether it was removed from the press - remained in dispute. Stamp Tech, Inc. v. Lydall/Thermal Acoustical, Inc., 186 Vt. 369, 987 A.2d 292 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the exclusivity provision of the workers' compensation statute is limited to employee claims against employers, it did not apply to the adjudication of a claim for the reimbursement or return of benefits. Gallipo v. City of Rutland, 178 Vt. 244, 882 A.2d 1177 (July 29, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because plaintiff's negligence complaint against defendant, a firm hired by her employer to provide her with vocational rehabilitation benefits after a workplace injury, set forth facts alleging that her economic injury occurred during her rehabilitation and resulted from defendant's failure to fulfill its obligation to provide her with training and job placement services, this section did not apply to her claim because her injury was not compensable under the Workers' Compensation Act. Wentworth v. Crawford & Co., 174 Vt. 118, 807 A.2d 351 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        As a general rule, workers' compensation is the exclusive remedy for workplace injuries, but there is an exception to the exclusivity rule: when a compensable injury is caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in a person other than the employer, such as a co-employee, an injured employee may seek recovery from that third party.

       <p>
        Nondelegable duty to provide a safe workplace applies to co-employee supervisors who are not owners or officers because the supervisory employee is the representative of the employer and a double recovery, worker's compensation and tort damages, is not permitted. Thus, a defendant can be acting as the employer even though he is not an owner or officer of the employer corporation. Garger v. Desroches, 185 Vt. 634, 974 A.2d 597 (mem.) (2009).

        With regard to the exclusivity provision of the Workers' Compensation Act, any distinction between omissions and affirmative acts is not relevant to the question of whether a defendant is performing a nondelegable duty of the employer. As long as a corporate duty is in issue, immunity exists whether the officer fails to discharge it or actually does so in a negligent manner; this issue turns on the nature of the duty that the plaintiff alleges is breached, and not the extent of the defendant's participation in the act.

       Where the injury for which compensation is payable under the provisions of this chapter was caused under circumstances creating a legal liability to pay the resulting damages in some person other than the employer, the acceptance of compensation benefits or the commencement of proceedings to enforce compensation payments shall not act as an election of remedies, but the injured employee or the employee's personal representative may also proceed to enforce the liability of such third party for damages in accordance with the provisions of this section. If the injured employee or the employee's personal representative does not commence the action within one year after the occurrence of the personal injury, then the employer or its insurance carrier may, within the period of time for the commencement of actions prescribed by statute, enforce the liability of the third party in the name of the injured employee or the employee's personal representative.

        Plaintiff may not maintain an action against an employer-employee safety committee or its employer and employee members for gross negligence or willful misconduct. This construction of the statute, which states: "The injured employee or the employee's personal representative shall be prohibited from commencing a civil action to enforce liability against the workers' compensation insurance carrier for conducting workplace inspections, or an employer-employee safety committee except in the case of gross negligence or willful misconduct," is contrary to its plain language, but absent more explicit direction from the Legislature, a court cannot apply the plain meaning of the statute without contravening other statutory provisions.

        The denial of loss of consortium claims under the exclusivity provision of the workers' compensation statute violates the common benefits clause of the Vermont Constitution; there is no rational basis for allowing an injured employee to bring a tort action against a third party while denying a loss of consortium claim by the employee's spouse.

        The exclusivity provision of the workers' compensation statute does not bar recovery for underinsured motorists (UIM) benefits from a self-insured employer because, as an employer, the company is also an insurer bound to provide UIM coverage on its motor vehicles and, when the employee seeks UIM payments from the employer, the employee is enforcing the employer's statutory obligation to provide UIM coverage irrespective of the method of insurance. Colwell v. Allstate Insurance Co., 175 Vt. 61, 819 A.2d 727 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        An employer may be subject to liability under exception to exclusive remedy provision of workers' compensation statute, if employer acted in capacity of a co-employee in negligently causing accident. Gerrish v. Savard, 169 Vt. 468, 739 A.2d 1195 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Employer was not subject to liability as a co-employee where he allegedly modified crane which subsequently injured plaintiff; employer was exercising managerial prerogatives and not merely taking place of a worker, and his actions came within scope of an employer's nondelegable duty to provide a safe workplace and safe tools and equipment. Gerrish v. Savard, 169 Vt. 468, 739 A.2d 1195 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not conflict with 21 V.S.A.
        §
        699; if their provisions are interpreted harmoniously, this section presents a complete and logical apportionment of risks, costs, and benefits, under various accident scenarios, among the employee injured in an accident, the workers' compensation carrier, and the employer's private liability insurer. Travelers Cos. v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., 164 Vt. 368, 670 A.2d 827 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is clear that, within this section, "third party" means a party who is not (1) the workers' compensation carrier, (2) the injured worker, or (3) the employer, notwithstanding that in many other contexts an agreement between an insurer and an insured would be described as one between first and second parties, with the phrase "third party" referring to one who was a stranger to the contract. Travelers Cos. v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., 164 Vt. 368, 670 A.2d 827 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the State's general obligation to defend its employees under the provisions of 3 V.S.A.
        §§
        1101-1104 arises independently of its liability under this chapter, third-party actions between fellow state employees do not contravene the plain language of subsection (a) of this section. Libercent v. Aldrich, 149 Vt. 76, 539 A.2d 981 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        To extent that provisions of section 622 of this title, making workmen's compensation exclusive remedy of injured employees, are inconsistent with 1959 amendment to this section which restores common law liability in favor of injured employee against stranger to employment contract, even though injured workman may have received compensation under this chapter, provisions of amendment must prevail. Ryan v. New Bedford Cordage Co., 421 F. Supp. 794 (D. Vt. 1976), affirmed, 559 F.2d 1206 (2d Cir. 1977).
       </p>

        Where liability of a general contractor to injured employees of an independent subcontractor is conditional, imposed by law in event subcontractor fails to secure compensation under this chapter, such contingent liability does not establish relationship of employer and employee between injured workmen and general contractor to shield general contractor, under section 622 of this title, from liability under this section.

        In an action brought in Vermont, the distribution of a negligence award between employee and employer's insurer was to be governed by Connecticut workers' compensation law where the employee had chosen to receive benefits for the injury giving rise to the action in Connecticut, and, although the Connecticut workers' compensation law required the employee to absorb the full expense of recovery alone, being less generous than this section, the Connecticut statutory scheme generally effected the same policies as this section, and its application did not give rise to a violation of the public policy of Vermont.

        When defendant sold its assets to a second company and plaintiff began working for the second company, plaintiff had no relationship with defendant beyond that of a former employee. Thus, when plaintiff was injured two years later while using a switch designed by defendant, he was not injured "in the course of his employment" with defendant, and defendant was not his employer for purposes of workers' compensation exclusivity, but was "some person other than the employer." Hemond & Hemond v. Frontier Communications of Am., Inc., 192 Vt. 646 (mem.), 59 A.3d 766 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        As a general rule, workers' compensation is the exclusive remedy for workplace injuries, but there is an exception to the exclusivity rule: when a compensable injury is caused under circumstances creating a legal liability in a person other than the employer, such as a co-employee, an injured employee may seek recovery from that third party. Dunham v. Chase, 165 Vt. 543, 674 A.2d 1279 (mem.) (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although a corporate officer defendant may be subject to co-employee liability for those negligent acts or omissions that breach a personal rather than a nondelegable corporate duty owed to a plaintiff employee, plaintiff employee must show that the duty owed by defendant was a personal duty, not simply a corporate duty to maintain a safe workplace.

         15. Reimbursement.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Workers' compensation carrier cannot seek reimbursement from life-insurance payments because such proceeds are not "damages," as contemplated by the reimbursement statute, paid because of a third party's tortious actions. Estate of Dunn v. Windham Northeast Supervisory Union, 192 Vt. 504, 60 A.3d 680 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Taking the statutory language of the workers' compensation reimbursement statute as a whole, a workers' compensation carrier is entitled to reimbursement only when a claimant or a claimant's estate receives money for damages because of a third party's responsibility for an injury. This is the case whether the claimant receives payment directly from the tortfeasor or, as happens frequently, from the third party's own liability insurer. Estate of Dunn v. Windham Northeast Supervisory Union, 192 Vt. 504, 60 A.3d 680 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Given the wording of the workers' compensation reimbursement statute, it is clear that the circumstances causing the injury must be the circumstances that create the liability to compensate it; this is to say, the statute necessarily refers to a cause of action an employee may maintain against a person responsible for her injuries. Indeed, the statute permits an employer or its carrier to commence such an action on behalf of the injured employee if the employee does not do so herself within a year. Estate of Dunn v. Windham Northeast Supervisory Union, 192 Vt. 504, 60 A.3d 680 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Workers' compensation reimbursement statute does not permit a workers' compensation insurer to tap a claimant's life-insurance proceeds for reimbursement because the proceeds of that particular type of first-party policy do not constitute damages paid because of a third party's action. Thus, an insurer was not entitled to reimbursement from life insurance proceeds for death benefits it had paid to a claimant's estate. Estate of Dunn v. Windham Northeast Supervisory Union, 192 Vt. 504, 60 A.3d 680 (2012).
       </p>

        There is no indication that the Legislature in the workers' compensation reimbursement statute intended to deviate from the normal legal meaning of "damages." Estate of Dunn v. Windham Northeast Supervisory Union, 192 Vt. 504, 60 A.3d 680 (2012).

        For purposes of determining whether a workers' compensation insurer is entitled under 21 V.S.A.
        §
        624(e) to reimbursement from proceeds that an employee receives under underinsured motorist (UIM) policies, (1) the UIM award is apportioned fairly and reasonably between noneconomic and economic damages; (2) the noneconomic portion of the award is necessarily excluded from reimbursement as there can be no possibility of double recovery; (3) the economic portion of the UIM award must be added to the benefits received under workers' compensation to determine whether the combined amount exceeds the employee's total economic damages; and (4) to the extent that the combined amount exceeds the employee's total economic damages, the insurer must be reimbursed that amount to prevent double recovery. Travelers Ins. Co. v. Henry, 470 F.3d 56 (2d Cir. 2006).

       <p>
        Under 21 V.S.A.
        §
        624(e), the proceeds of an underinsured motorist (UIM) policy that was purchased by an employee and the proceeds of an employer-purchased UIM policy did not have to be used to reimburse a workers' compensation insurer except to the extent necessary to prevent double recovery, and reimbursement from the economic portion of the employee's UIM awards was permitted only to the extent necessary to prevent actual double recovery. Travelers Ins. Co. v. Henry, 470 F.3d 56 (2d Cir. 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Economic damages recoverable by the workers' compensation insurer include those awarded for lost wages, diminished earning capacity, medical expenses, vocational rehabilitative services, and in the case of the employee's death, burial and funeral expenses, and wage replacement paid to a surviving spouse, dependent children, or other dependents. If the employee recovers such damages and has already been compensated for these losses by the insurer, the insurer is entitled to reimbursement to prevent a double recovery. Travelers Insurance Company v. Henry, 178 Vt. 287, 882 A.2d 1133 (June 24, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Damages that the employee recovers under a first-party insurance policy, including compensation for pain and suffering and other related non-monetary injuries, are considered noneconomic damages. Because workers' compensation does not compensate an employee for such losses, there is no danger of a double recovery, and the insurer is not entitled to reimbursement from this portion of the employee's award. Travelers Insurance Company v. Henry, 178 Vt. 287, 882 A.2d 1133 (June 24, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        A workers' compensation carrier has no right to reimbursement from, nor a future credit against, UIM proceeds that an employee recovers under an employer-purchased automobile liability policy, except to prevent a double recovery. To determine whether a double recovery has occurred, the nature and extent of an injured employee's damages must first be determined. The employee must then reimburse the workers' compensation carrier out of the economic damages portion of his UIM award. Travelers Insurance Company v. Henry, 178 Vt. 287, 882 A.2d 1133 (June 24, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the plain language of this section, an employee's recovery of UIM proceeds under an automobile liability policy purchased by the employer is a "first party insurance payment or benefit" that is not subject to the workers' compensation carrier's right to reimbursement except to prevent a double recovery. Travelers Insurance Company v. Henry, 178 Vt. 287, 882 A.2d 1133 (June 24, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although, where an injured employee by law cannot recover economic losses from a third party, her workers' compensation carrier should likewise not be entitled to recoup its losses from the injured employee; where an injured employee may recover both economic and noneconomic damages from a third party, the plain language of subsection (e) controls, and the workers' compensation carrier may recoup its compensation award from any recovery (economic and/or noneconomic) obtained in a third-party suit. Brunet v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Group, 165 Vt. 315, 682 A.2d 487 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where injured Vermont employee was not entitled under New York law to recover economic losses from driver of other vehicle, in personal injury action in New York, employer's worker's compensation carrier would likewise not be entitled to recoup its losses from employee, and subsection (e) of this section, governing reimbursement of worker's compensation carriers, would be read to mean carrier could recover any amount of economic losses employee would be entitled to recover.

       <p>
        There was no merit to a cleaning service's argument that a worker who brought a third-party action against it was no longer a real party in interest after she settled her workers' compensation claim with her employer. Although the employer or its insurance carrier would, after the settlement, have had a right to reimbursement from any recovery the worker made in her claim against the cleaning service, the worker remained an interested party; any amount recovered beyond the amount due to the employer as reimbursement would have been hers as an advance on future workers' compensation payments, and any amount greater than the sum of past and future workers' compensation payments would be hers alone.

       </p>
       <p>
        Because the workers' compensation statute explicitly authorized injured employees to proceed against third parties, a worker who brought suit against a third party was a real party in interest, and the fact that the statute allowed an employer to be reimbursed from recoveries awarded to employees did not compel a different result.

       </p>
       <p>
        Worker's allegations against his co-employees for negligence stated nothing beyond a breach of the employer's nondelegable duty to maintain a safe workplace. As this duty inured to the employer alone, and could not be delegated, the trial court properly dismissed the workers' claims against the co-employees. Chayer v. Ethan Allen, Inc., 183 Vt. 439, 954 A.2d 783 (Apr. 11, 2008).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Nondelegable duty to provide a safe workplace applies to co-employee supervisors who are not owners or officers because the supervisory employee is the representative of the employer and a double recovery, worker's compensation and tort damages, is not permitted. Thus, a defendant can be acting as the employer even though he is not an owner or officer of the employer corporation. Garger v. Desroches, 185 Vt. 634, 974 A.2d 597 (mem.) (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Employee's negligence suit against a co-employee supervisor who ordered him to drive an all-terrain vehicle up a steep incline was barred by the exclusivity provision of the Workers' Compensation Act. The nondelegable duty to provide a safe workplace applied to co-employee supervisors who were not owners or officers; the supervisor's negligence was not a breach of a duty separate from the employer's nondelegable duty to provide a safe workplace; and the employee had not alleged that the supervisor had a specific intent to injure or knew with substantial certainty that injury would result. Garger v. Desroches, 185 Vt. 634, 974 A.2d 597 (mem.) (2009).

       An employer subject to the provisions of this chapter shall furnish to an injured employee reasonable surgical, medical, and nursing services and supplies, including prescription drugs and durable medical equipment. The employer shall provide assistive devices and modification to vehicles and residences reasonably necessary to permit an injured worker who is determined to have or expected to suffer a permanent disability, such as an ambulatory disability as defined in <cite class="vt-code">20 V.S.A. § 2900</cite> or blindness as defined in <cite class="vt-code">20 V.S.A. § 2900</cite>, that substantially and permanently prevents or limits the worker's ability to continue to live at home or perform basic life functions. In determining what devices and modifications are reasonably necessary, consideration shall be given to factors that include ownership of the residence to be modified, the length of time the worker is expected to utilize and benefit from the devices or modifications, and the extent to which the devices or modifications enhance or improve the worker's independent functioning. The employer shall also furnish reasonable hospital services and supplies, including surgical, medical, and nursing services while the injured employee is confined in a hospital for treatment and care.

       An employer may designate the treating health care provider to initially treat an injured employee immediately following a compensable injury. Thereafter, the employee may select another health care provider upon giving the employer written notice of the employee's reasons for dissatisfaction with the health care provider designated by the employer and the name and address of the health care provider selected by the employee. The Commissioner may permit an employer to refuse to reimburse a health care provider selected by the employee if notice required in this subsection is not provided to the employer unless the failure to provide notice is due to excusable neglect or inadvertence.

       An employer shall not withhold any wages from an employee for the employee's absence from work for treatment of a work injury or to attend a medical examination related to a work injury. If the employee selects a new health care provider in accordance with subsection (b) of this section, the employer shall have the right to require other medical examinations as provided in this chapter.

       The liability of the employer to pay for medical, surgical, hospital, and nursing services and supplies, prescription drugs, and durable medical equipment provided to the injured employee under this section shall not exceed the maximum fee for a particular service, prescription drug, or durable medical equipment as provided by a schedule of fees and rates prepared by the Commissioner. The reimbursement rate for services and supplies in the fee schedule shall include consideration of medical necessity, clinical efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and safety, and those services and supplies shall be provided on a nondiscriminatory basis consistent with workers' compensation and health care law. The Commissioner shall authorize reimbursement at a rate higher than the scheduled rate if the employee demonstrates to the Commissioner's satisfaction that reasonable and necessary treatment, prescription drugs, or durable medical equipment is not available at the scheduled rate. An employer shall establish direct billing and payment procedures and notification procedures as necessary for coverage of medically-necessary prescription medications for chronic conditions of injured employees, in accordance with rules adopted by the Commissioner.

       In the case of a work-related, first-aid-only injury, the employer shall file the first report of injury with the Department of Labor. The employer shall file the first report of injury with the workers' compensation insurance carrier or pay the medical bill within 30 days. If the employer contests a claim, a first report of injury shall be forwarded to the Department of Labor and the insurer within five days of notice. If additional treatment or medical visits are required or if the employee loses more than one day of work, the claim shall be promptly reported to the workers' compensation insurer, which shall adjust the claim. "Work-related, first-aid-only-treatment" means any one-time treatment that generates a bill for less than $750.00 and for which the employee loses no time from work except for the time for medical treatment and recovery not to exceed one day of absence from work.

        Claimant had not shown that voice recognition software was a reasonably necessary medical benefit, as her physician's letter did not provide information about her daily computer use, its impact on her, whether she was at risk without the software, and how this technology would promote further healing, and did not support the inference that keyboarding was a basic life function in the claimant's circumstances.

       <p>
        For purposes of workers' compensation benefits, claimant's spouse provided compensable "nursing services" which went beyond ordinary household duties. Claimant required supervision 24 hours a day and spouse was assigned a number of tasks by her husband's physicians, including administering, altering and monitoring his medications, keeping a log of his behavior, and monitoring his seizure activity and responding appropriately. Close v. Superior Excavating Co., 166 Vt. 318, 693 A.2d 729 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        For purposes of workers' compensation benefits, the decision to compensate claimant's spouse for the entire time she was "on call" to provide nursing services to her injured husband was reasonable and well within the discretion of the commissioner. A caregiver is constantly "on call," even though part of the caregiver's time is spent performing other household chores. Close v. Superior Excavating Co., 166 Vt. 318, 693 A.2d 729 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        In proceedings to secure the payment of workers' compensation benefits for nursing services provided by claimant's wife, as the employer had knowledge of the extent of the injury and the amount awarded was no more and probably somewhat less than the employer would have been required to pay if claimant had been placed in full-time care during this period, the decision to award benefits from the date of claimant's discharge, and not from the date when claimant's spouse decided to accept assistance in caring for her husband, was fair and reasonable. Close v. Superior Excavating Co., 166 Vt. 318, 693 A.2d 729 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        In proceedings to secure the payment of workers' compensation benefits for nursing services provided by claimant's wife, the decision to order compensation at the rate of $4.10 per hour was not unreasonable, despite claimant's urging of the adoption of compensation at a rate of $18 per hour based on the testimony of claimant's physician that many of the services provided by claimant's spouse were consistent with work done by registered nurses or physician assistants. Although some of the work was of a skilled nature, for much of the time claimant's spouse provided "passive attendance." Using the prevailing minimum wage resulted in a total amount of compensation close to what the employer would have paid for 24-hour care at the residential facility where claimant later lived. Close v. Superior Excavating Co., 166 Vt. 318, 693 A.2d 729 (1997).

       When as a result of an injury covered by this chapter, an employee is unable to perform work for which the employee has previous training or experience, the employee shall be entitled to vocational rehabilitation services, including retraining and job placement, as may be reasonably necessary to restore the employee to suitable employment. Vocational rehabilitation services shall be provided as follows:
       <ol>
        <li id="t21c09s641ol1a1">
         The employer shall designate a vocational rehabilitation provider from a list provided by the Commissioner to initially provide services. Thereafter, absent good cause, the employee may have only one opportunity to select another vocational rehabilitation provider from a list provided by the Commissioner upon giving the employer written notice of the employee's reasons for dissatisfaction with the designated provider and the name and address of the provider selected by the employee.
        </li>
        <li id="t21c09s641ol1a2">
         The Department shall provide an injured worker with a form that includes information and employee rights. The form shall clearly and simply explain the worker's rights, including the choice of provider, the right to challenge a determination, and reimbursement for related expenses. The worker shall sign the form and return it to the Department.

         The Commissioner shall adopt rules to ensure that a worker who requests services or who has been out of work for more than 90 days is timely and cost-effectively screened for benefits under this section. The rules shall:

          <li id="t21c09s641ol1a3A">
           Provide that all vocational rehabilitation work, except for initial screenings, be performed by a Vermont-certified vocational rehabilitation counselor, including counselors currently certified pursuant to the rules of the Department.

          </li>
          <li id="t21c09s641ol1a3B">
           Provide for an initial screening to determine whether a full assessment is appropriate. An injured worker who is determined to be eligible for a full assessment shall be timely assessed and offered appropriate vocational rehabilitation services.
          </li>
          <li id="t21c09s641ol1a3C">
           Provide a mechanism for a periodic and timely screening of injured workers who are initially found not to be ready or eligible for a full assessment to determine whether a full assessment has become appropriate.

         If services are not voluntarily offered and accepted by the employee, the Commissioner, if necessary through informal hearing, may refer the employee to a qualified physician or appropriate facility for evaluation of the practicability of, need for, and kind of service, treatment, or training necessary and appropriate to render the employee fit for a remunerative occupation. Upon receipt of findings and after affording the parties an opportunity to be heard, the Commissioner may order that the services and treatment recommended, or such other rehabilitation treatment or service the Commissioner may deem necessary be provided at the expense of the employer. When vocational rehabilitation requires residence at or near a facility or institution, away from the employee's customary residence, the reasonable cost of board, lodging, or travel, or both, shall be paid for by the employer. In addition, the employer shall pay reasonable costs of books, tools, or other basic materials required in such rehabilitation process. Refusal to accept vocational rehabilitation pursuant to an order of the Commissioner may result in loss of compensation for each week of the refusal, if the Commissioner so directs.

         The Commissioner may set by rule reasonable reimbursement rates for vocational rehabilitation benefits and services, provided access to vocational rehabilitation services is not diminished, and reasonable choices and access to benefits and services are maintained.

       Any vocational rehabilitation plan for a claimant presented to the employer shall be deemed valid if the employer was provided an opportunity to participate in the development of the plan and has made no objections or changes within 21 days after submission. A vocational rehabilitation counselor shall provide the employer with a written invitation to participate in plan development, including the date, time, and place to provide an opportunity to participate in the development of the plan, with a copy to the Department. The participation in the development of the plan may be conducted by telephone.

        With regard to whether the claimant's employer was obligated to pay for voice recognition software as a vocational rehabilitation benefit, the Labor Commissioner properly held that a workers' compensation claimant had found suitable employment. Although the claimant's vocational rehabilitation counselor stated that her job security and suitability was not firmly established, he did not assert that her current employment was not expected to continue indefinitely, and neither the counselor nor the claimant identified any factors that posed a reasonably imminent threat to the continuity of her employment or showed that if the claimant's work for the child she was currently serving were to terminate, the claimant would be unlikely to find an alternative client relatively quickly. Morisseau v. Hannaford Brothers, 201 Vt. 313, 141 A.3d 745 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Commissioner erred in concluding that claimant was not entitled to rehabilitation services, where commissioner explicitly excluded consideration of claimant's preinjury wage and temperament, or personal choice, in determination of whether work she was able to do was "suitable."

       </p>
       <p>
        Commissioner of labor and industry properly denied claimant's proposed rehabilitation plan where the undisputed testimony indicated that the plan, costing $2,695.00, would only result in $200.00 annual income, since such a return was insufficient to elevate the project to suitable employment as required in subsection (b) of this section.

        Employer's policy - under which workers with nonwork-related long-term disabilities that rendered them unable to substantially perform their responsibilities were placed on disability leave at fifty percent of salary, as opposed to workers with work-related disabilities, who were encouraged to accept accommodations, including alternative work, and who received full pay - did not specifically condition any employment or benefit rule on pregnancy and was facially neutral and affected pregnant women because their temporary disability, and those of others both male and female, was not work related.

        §
        641(a) was dismissed where the employee failed to seek a hearing or informal conference with the Vermont Department of Labor and Industry; thus, the employee failed to exhaust available administrative remedies to address the employer's delay in providing vocational rehabilitation. Buote v. Verizon New Eng., 249 F. Supp. 2d 422 (D. Vt. 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff's negligence complaint against defendant, a firm hired by her employer to provide her with vocational rehabilitation benefits after a workplace injury, was properly dismissed because she did not first pursue and exhaust the administrative remedies the Department of Labor and Industry designed to redress any problems associated with defendant's provision of the services. Wentworth v. Crawford & Co., 174 Vt. 118, 807 A.2d 351 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because plaintiff's negligence complaint against defendant, a firm hired by her employer to provide her with vocational rehabilitation benefits after a workplace injury, set forth facts alleging that her economic injury occurred during her rehabilitation and resulted from defendant's failure to fulfill its obligation to provide her with training and job placement services, the exclusivity provision of the Workers' Compensation Act did not apply to her claim because her injury was not compensable. Wentworth v. Crawford & Co., 174 Vt. 118, 807 A.2d 351 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff's negligence claim against defendant, a firm hired by her employer to provide her with vocational rehabilitation benefits after a workplace injury, was properly dismissed because her complaint did not allege facts sufficient to find that defendant owed her any actionable duty to prevent her economic losses. Wentworth v. Crawford & Co., 174 Vt. 118, 807 A.2d 351 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff failed in her claim that defendant, a firm hired by her employer to provide her with vocational rehabilitation benefits after a workplace injury, owed her a duty arising from contract or an independent duty to protect her economic interests. Wentworth v. Crawford & Co., 174 Vt. 118, 807 A.2d 351 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff failed in her argument that the trade of defendant, a firm hired by her employer to provide her with vocational rehabilitation benefits after a workplace injury, gave rise to a legal duty to protect her economic interests because neither her complaint nor her appellate brief alleged that defendant held itself out as a provider of a licensed professional service requiring a professional rather than ordinary standard of care. Wentworth v. Crawford & Co., 174 Vt. 118, 807 A.2d 351 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vocational service provider hired by plaintiff's employer to provide her with vocational rehabilitation benefits after a workplace injury, did not owe her a duty under the rules of the Department of Labor and Industry to prepare, and have her sign an "Individual Written Rehabilitation Plan" (IWRP) to help her procure suitable employment because neither this section nor the Department's implementing regulations place sole responsibility for preparing an IWRP on the provider. Wentworth v. Crawford & Co., 174 Vt. 118, 807 A.2d 351 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff's assertions that defendant, a vocational service provider hired by her employer, owed her a duty to pursue employment opportunities on her behalf, preserve her reinstatement rights, and provide her with training were insufficient as a matter of law. Wentworth v. Crawford & Co., 174 Vt. 118, 807 A.2d 351 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutes and regulations did not support plaintiff's contention that defendant, a vocational service provider hired by her employer, had a legal obligation to provide her with training. Wentworth v. Crawford & Co., 174 Vt. 118, 807 A.2d 351 (2002).

       § 642. Temporary total disability benefits.
       <br />
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      Where the injury causes total disability for work, during such disability, but not including the first three days, the day of the accident to be counted as the first day, unless the employee received full wages for that day, the employer shall pay the injured employee a weekly compensation equal to two-thirds of the employee's average weekly wages, but not more than the maximum nor less than the minimum weekly compensation. In addition, the injured employee, during the disability period shall receive $10.00 a week for each dependent child who is unmarried and under the age of 21 years, provided that no other injured worker is receiving the same benefits on behalf of the dependent child or children. However, in no event shall an employee's total weekly wage replacement benefits, including any payments for a dependent child, exceed 90 percent of the employee's average weekly wage prior to applying any applicable cost of living adjustment. The amount allowed for dependent children shall be increased or decreased weekly to reflect the number of dependent children extant during the week of payment. If the total disability continues after the third day for a period of seven consecutive calendar days or more, compensation shall be paid for the whole period of the total disability.

        Where in 1972, the time an employee suffered a work-related injury which resulted in temporary total disability, subsection (a) of this section had been amended to provide that compensation would be allowed for the whole period of the disability, while section 643 of this title, governing the period of payments for such a disability, enacted in 1955, limited compensation to a period of 330 weeks, since the sections were in irreconcilable conflict, this one, being the more recent, would prevail. Montgomery v. Brinver Corp., 142 Vt. 461, 457 A.2d 644 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The words "disability for work" employed in this section and in section 646 of this title, relating to temporary partial disability benefits, refer to present earning capacity and convey a different legislative meaning and purpose than the permanent disability resulting from the scheduled injuries specified in section 648 of this title.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Temporary disability benefits are awarded on the basis of the individual's incapacity for work, which involves consideration of not only the physical injury, but also of other factors restricting the claimant's capacity to obtain work. Bishop v. Town of Barre, 140 Vt. 564, 442 A.2d 50 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Total incapacity for work does not imply an absolute disability to perform any kind of labor; thus a person who is disqualified from performing the usual tasks of a workman in such a way as to enable him to procure and retain employment is ordinarily regarded as totally incapacitated, but the test is not whether the injured employee is totally incapacitated from performing the same kind of labor as he was performing at the time of his injury, but whether he is capable of performing any kind of available work. Sivret v. Knight, 118 Vt. 343, 109 A.2d 495 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        Incapacity for work means loss of earning power as a workman in consequence of injury, whether loss manifests itself in inability to perform such work as may be obtainable or inability to secure such work to do, providing lack of opportunity to work is not due to workman's fault or to general business depression. Roller v. Warren, 98 Vt. 514, 129 A. 168 (1925); Sivret v. Knight, 118 Vt. 343, 109 A.2d 495 (1954).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Employee's pregnancy was not a superseding, intervening event that broke causal connection between her work-related accident and her disability; Commissioner of Labor and Industry's refusal to allow employer to discontinue employee's temporary total disability benefits during time of her pregnancy was therefore reasonable and consistent with statutory language. Wood v. Fletcher Allen Health Care, 169 Vt. 419, 739 A.2d 1201 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under Vermont workers' compensation law, a claimant is entitled to temporary disability compensation until reaching a medical end result or successfully returning to work, and the determination of "medical end result" is a question of fact for the Commissioner; the proper test when determining the medical end result is whether the treatment contemplated at the time it was given was reasonably expected to bring about significant medical improvement, and the fact that some treatment, such as drug or physical therapy, continues to be necessary does not preclude a finding of medical end result if the underlying condition causing the disability has become stable and if further treatment will not improve that condition. Coburn v. Frank Dodge & Sons, 165 Vt. 529, 687 A.2d 465 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        A claimant participating in a vocational rehabilitation program is not entitled to temporary total disability benefits if he has reached a medical end to treatment for his work-related injuries. Wroten v. Lamphere, 147 Vt. 606, 523 A.2d 1236 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section temporary disability benefits are provided for workers who suffer a disability for work done during the period between their injury and final recovery, and once the recovery process has ended, or the worker has achieved the maximum possible restoration of his earning power, he is no longer entitled to temporary disability benefits. Bishop v. Town of Barre, 140 Vt. 564, 442 A.2d 50 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Temporary as distinguished from permanent disability is a condition of reduced earning power that exists until the injured workman is as far restored as the permanent character of his injuries will permit, and is measured by the duration of the healing period. Orvis v. Hutchins, 123 Vt. 18, 179 A.2d 470 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        Period of temporary total disability need not be continuous and immediately following injury, but may be broken up in continuing intervals. Wilkins v. Blanchard-McDonald Lumber Co., 115 Vt. 89, 52 A.2d 781 (1947); Orvis v. Hutchins, 123 Vt. 18, 179 A.2d 470 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        Man is physically able to work when he can do so without endangering his life or health and he is not required to continue to work if it will cause him to suffer serious discomfort and pain while so engaged. Sivret v. Knight, 118 Vt. 343, 109 A.2d 495 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where employee was practically blind in his right eye and, while employed, suffered an accident through which he lost his left eye, he was entitled to compensation as for total and permanent disability, in spite of employer's claim that total disability ceased after wound caused by removal of left eye had healed. Notte v. Rutland Railroad, 112 Vt. 498, 28 A.2d 378 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        A person's incapacity for work is total not only so long as he is unable to do any work of any character, but also while he remains unable as a result of his injury either to resume his former occupation or to procure remunerative employment at a different occupation suited to his impaired capacity. Roller v. Warren, 98 Vt. 514, 129 A. 168 (1925); Sivret v. Knight, 118 Vt. 343, 109 A.2d 495 (1954).

        Since this section relates to compensation payable to the injured workman rather than to any dependent, it is apparent that the Legislative intent in authorizing additional compensation for dependents under this section was to help compensate an injured employee in relation to the number of dependents he had. 1954-56 Op. Atty. Gen. 199.

        Proof of actual dependency as well as age should be required before granting additional compensation for dependents under this section. 1954-56 Op. Atty. Gen. 199.

      Unless an injured worker has successfully returned to work, an employer shall notify both the Commissioner and the employee prior to terminating benefits under either section 642 or 646 of this title. The notice of intention to discontinue payments shall be filed on forms prescribed by the Commissioner and shall include the date of the proposed discontinuance, the reasons for it, and, if the employee has been out of work for 90 days, a verification that the employer offered vocational rehabilitation screening and services as required under this chapter. All relevant evidence, including evidence that does not support discontinuance in the possession of the employer not already filed, shall be filed with the notice. The liability for the payments shall continue for seven days after the notice is received by the Commissioner and the employee. If the claimant disputes the discontinuance, the claimant may file with the Commissioner an objection to the discontinuance and seek an extension of 14 days. The objection to the discontinuance shall be specific as to the reasons and include supporting evidence. A copy of the objection shall be provided to the employer at the time the request is made to the Commissioner. Those payments shall be made without prejudice to the employer and may be deducted from any amounts due pursuant to section 648 of this title if the Commissioner determines that the discontinuance is warranted or if otherwise ordered by the Commissioner. Every notice shall be reviewed by the Commissioner to determine the sufficiency of the basis for the proposed discontinuance. If, after review of all the evidence in the file, the Commissioner finds that a preponderance of all the evidence in the file does not reasonably support the proposed discontinuance, the Commissioner shall order that payments continue until a hearing is held and a decision is rendered. Prior to a formal hearing, an injured worker may request reinstatement of benefits by providing additional new evidence to the Department that establishes that a preponderance of all evidence now supports the claim. If the Commissioner's decision, after a hearing, is that the employee was not entitled to any or all benefits paid between the discontinuance and the final decision, upon request of the employer, the Commissioner may order that the employee repay all benefits to which the employee was not entitled. The employer may enforce a repayment order in any court of law having jurisdiction.

        643b, 710 because those claims, though based on disability status and retaliation, were not totally unrelated to the FLSA claims, and adjudication of these state law claims was apt to require many of the same witnesses, much of the same evidence, and determination of many of the same facts.

        Section 643b(b) of Vermont's workers' compensation statute creates a narrow job protection that offsets any disadvantages experienced by the injured worker, while accommodating the employer's need to fill vacant positions when they arise, and section 643b(d)(2) provides a narrow exception to the reinstatement obligation, which applies if a term of employment limits the duration of that employment and that durational limit is reached before the injured worker is ready to return to work; where the supreme court concluded that the exception to the reinstatement right is more narrow than the trial court found, summary judgment was inappropriate.

        Where claimant was entitled by statute to permanent disability benefits according to the unchallenged finding of the Commissioner of Labor that his disability was permanent, the statute providing a penalty for false representation (21 V.S.A.
        §
        708(a)) did not relieve his employer from its obligation to provide permanent disability benefits. Butler v. Huttig Bldg. Prods., 175 Vt. 323, 830 A.2d 44 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section compensates for injuries which as a general rule tend to have the most severe impact on earning capacity while section 648 of this title, governing permanent partial disability benefits, compensates for injuries which generally have a less serious impact and rates the scheduled impairments accordingly.

        Subsection (b) of this section provides no criteria for unscheduled impairments; however, under section 648 of this title, governing partial disability, unscheduled injuries must be compensated proportionately to compensation awarded for scheduled impairments, and the same standard is required for evaluating total disability for unscheduled impairments.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In order to further the purpose of this chapter of establishing an expedient, efficient remedy for injured workers, the legislature has chosen a scheduled benefits system, with a rate of compensation for listed injuries conclusively determined, so that resolution of these issues on a case by case basis is not required, thus avoiding impeding the process and delaying awards to needy beneficiaries, while still protecting against wage loss by awarding permanent disability benefits on the basis of physical impairment as a means to insure against wage loss.

        Where employee was practically blind in his right eye and, while employed, suffered an accident through which he lost his left eye, he was entitled to compensation as for total and permanent disability, in spite of employer's claim that total disability ceased after wound caused by removal of left eye had healed.

       <p>
        In order for awards for unscheduled injuries under subsection (b) of this section and section 648 of this title to be proportionate to the compensation for scheduled impairments, as is required, they must be computed with reference to the criteria underlying the awards for scheduled impairments, and those criteria address impairment to wage loss on a general, not individual, basis. Bishop v. Town of Barre, 140 Vt. 564, 442 A.2d 50 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where commissioner of labor and industry evaluated disability of claimant for permanent disability benefits based upon an unscheduled injury without reference to the claimant's ability to work, the commissioner's calculation of benefits was correct since individual economic capacity is rejected in this chapter and irrelevant to the evaluation of unscheduled injuries, the sole criterion of permanent disability being physical impairment.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Guided by the legislature's express statement of intent, the Vermont Supreme Court holds that the 2014 amendment defining "total and permanent disability" as an "injury to the skull resulting in severe traumatic brain injury causing permanent and severe cognitive, physical, or psychiatric disabilities" applies retroactively because it is a remedial change. West v. N. Branch Fire Dist. #1, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (June 18, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Guided by the legislature's statement of intent in Act 96 and based on how courts have interpreted the terms "imbecility" and "insanity" in the workers' compensation context, the Vermont Supreme Court concludes that the 2014 amendment defining "total and permanent disability" as an "injury to the skull resulting in severe traumatic brain injury causing permanent and severe cognitive, physical, or psychiatric disabilities" is a non-substantive, remedial change. The amendment is a modern, more respectful articulation of the "incurable imbecility or insanity" standard that is consistent with the functional definitions of "imbecility" and "insanity" that several courts have adopted, including the Michigan Supreme Court, the Virginia Court of Appeals, and the Texas Court of Appeals. West v. N. Branch Fire Dist. #1, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (June 18, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Workers' compensation claimant had not waived his right to seek permanent and total disability benefits for an "injury to the skull resulting in severe traumatic brain injury causing permanent and severe cognitive, physical, or psychiatric disabilities." The legislature expressly sought to cultivate a culture of respect towards persons with disabilities by amending the provision, which prior to the 2014 amendment referred to "an injury to the skull resulting in incurable imbecility or insanity," and the claimant had consistently expressed his desire to proceed under the more respectful 2014 standard. West v. N. Branch Fire Dist. #1, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (June 18, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Employer was not entitled to summary judgment on the question of whether the workers' compensation claimant was permanently and totally disabled by an "injury to the skull resulting in severe traumatic brain injury causing permanent and severe cognitive, physical, or psychiatric disabilities." The fact that the claimant was presently employed did not mean he could not be disabled, as total and permanent disability under the provision was not based on a claimant's ability to work, and disputed facts remained about the exact scope of his impairment. West v. N. Branch Fire Dist. #1, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (June 18, 2021).

        The words "disability for work" employed in this section and in section 642 of this title, relating to temporary total disability benefits, refer to present earning capacity and convey a different legislative meaning and purpose than the permanent disability resulting from the scheduled injuries specified in section 648 of this title.

         2. Criteria for award of benefits.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Temporary disability benefits are awarded on the basis of the individual's incapacity for work, which involves consideration of not only the physical injury, but also of other factors restricting the claimant's capacity to obtain work. Bishop v. Town of Barre, 140 Vt. 564, 442 A.2d 50 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to justify compensation for temporary partial disability, it must appear from the facts presented that the claimant, though able to earn some wages, has not regained full earning power and that he is still in the process of physical recovery. Orvis v. Hutchins, 123 Vt. 18, 179 A.2d 470 (1962).

         3. Partial incapacity.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Partial incapacity for work is where injured workman is able both to procure and to perform work at some occupation suitable to his then existing capacity, but less remunerative than the work in which he was engaged when injured. Roller v. Warren, 98 Vt. 514, 129 A. 168 (1925).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Under this section temporary disability benefits are provided for workers who suffer a disability for work done during the period between their injury and final recovery, and once the recovery process has ended, or the worker has achieved the maximum possible restoration of his earning power, he is no longer entitled to temporary disability benefits. Bishop v. Town of Barre, 140 Vt. 564, 442 A.2d 50 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Temporary as distinguished from permanent disability is a condition of reduced earning power that exists until the injured workman is as far restored as the permanent character of his injuries will permit, and is measured by the duration of the healing period. Orvis v. Hutchins, 123 Vt. 18, 179 A.2d 470 (1962).

     Implementation of "whole person" rating method for determination of permanent partial disability compensation awards; study and report.

      </p>
      <p>
       "(a) Beginning on April 1, 1995, under Sec. 7 of this act [which amended this section], awards for permanent partial disability compensation shall be made in accordance with the 'whole person' rating method pursuant to the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment in a manner that does not diminish the total amount of awards for permanent partial disability.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(b) To ensure that awards under the 'whole person' rating do not result in a reduction from awards under the current permanent partial disability compensation system, the department of labor and industry shall study, in consultation with the governor's advisory council and with the assistance of independent experts, the impact of Sec. 7 on the total amount of permanent partial disability paid. As part of such study, the department shall compute each permanent partial disability award for the period July 1, 1992, through July 1, 1994, by two methods: (1) in accordance with 21 V.S.A.
       §
       648; and (2) in accordance with the whole person rating pursuant to the AMA Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment. The department shall reports its findings to the legislature no later than January 1, 1995.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(c) If the department finds that the use of the whole person rating method would result in greater than a two percent reduction in overall permanent partial disability compensation, the department shall by rule, effective April 1, 1995, adjust such method of awarding permanent partial disability compensation so as to offset any resulting reduction in awards under 21 V.S.A.

        "Diagnosis" of a condition is not the same as "the existence of an impairment," and the reference in the permanent partial disability benefits statute to the "existence" of an impairment does not broaden that provision's focus on impairment to include diagnosis, injury, or any other concept; it just reflects an acknowledgment that in some cases an injury may not give rise to any associated permanent impairment.

        Where claimant was entitled by statute to permanent disability benefits according to the unchallenged finding of the Commissioner of Labor that his disability was permanent, the statute providing a penalty for false representation (21 V.S.A.
        §
        708(a)) did not relieve his employer from its obligation to provide permanent disability benefits. Butler v. Huttig Bldg. Prods., 175 Vt. 323, 830 A.2d 44 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Employer was not required to pay permanent partial disability (PPD) benefits to injured employee, since employer was not barred from raising statute of limitations as a defense to payment of PPD benefits, as it had no duty to investigate employee's permanency status or inform him of his right to PPD benefits. Longe v. Boise Cascade Corp., 171 Vt. 214, 762 A.2d 1248 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Injuries which as a general rule tend to have the most severe impact on earning capacity are compensated for under section 644 of this title while this section compensates for injuries which generally have a less serious impact and rates the unscheduled impairments accordingly. Bishop v. Town of Barre, 140 Vt. 564, 442 A.2d 50 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The definition of partial disability contained in section 601 of this title, which states that partial disability may be held to include diminished ability to obtain employment owing to disfigurement resulting from an injury, does not apply to this section and only addresses the award of temporary benefits for temporary disability: The text of section 646 of this title contains the defined term, while the text of this section does not, and ability to work is a crucial factor in computing temporary disability benefits, but not in computing permanent partial benefits, which relies upon a scheduled benefits system. Bishop v. Town of Barre, 140 Vt. 564, 442 A.2d 50 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The words "disability for work" employed in sections 642 and 646 of this title, relating to temporary disability benefits, refer to present earning capacity and convey a different legislative meaning and purpose than the permanent disability resulting from the scheduled injuries specified in this section.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In order to further the purpose of this chapter of establishing an expedient, efficient remedy for injured workers, the legislature has chosen a scheduled benefits system, with a rate of compensation for listed injuries conclusively determined, so that resolution of these issues on a case by case basis is not required, thus avoiding impeding the process and delaying awards to needy beneficiaries, while still protecting against wage loss by awarding permanent disability benefits on the basis of physical impairment as a means to insure against wage loss.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Permanent disability benefits are calculated solely on the basis of physical impairment, and this section has arbitrarily fixed the amount of compensation to be paid for scheduled specific injuries regardless of loss of present earning power. Bishop v. Town of Barre, 140 Vt. 564, 442 A.2d 50 (1982).
       </p>

        The plain meaning, history and structure of this chapter preclude the consideration of individual wage loss in computing permanent benefits. Bishop v. Town of Barre, 140 Vt. 564, 442 A.2d 50 (1982).

       <p>

       <p>
        Under this section, the amount of compensation for back injuries must be assessed based on the percentage of loss of the back's function rather than on the degree of impairment of the whole person. Stamper v. University Apartments, Inc., 147 Vt. 552, 522 A.2d 227 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Commissioner of Labor and Industry properly rejected American Medical Association guidelines for computing the degree of claimant's disability where the guidelines were premised on a whole person standard. Stamper v. University Apartments, Inc., 147 Vt. 552, 522 A.2d 227 (1986).

       <p>
        Where claimant for permanent disability benefits based on an unscheduled injury suffered a 35 to 40 percent impairment of the spine, resulting in a 20 percent impairment of the whole man, and Commissioner of Labor and Industry awarded 66 weeks of permanent partial disability benefits on the basis of the twenty percent figure award would be reversed; benefits should have been awarded on the basis of the 35 to 40 percent back impairment, since subdivision (18) of this section, in providing compensation for unscheduled injuries, focuses solely upon the injuries themselves and the percentage of loss to the back was the appropriate standard. Bishop v. Town of Barre, 140 Vt. 564, 442 A.2d 50 (1982).

       <p>
        Claimant who suffered loss by amputation of two fingers and total loss of use of another was entitled to award of compensation under subdivision (18) of this section, providing that in other cases of class covered in the section, i.e., loss of specific members or functions, compensation should bear such relation to amounts stated for specific losses as disabilities bear to those produced by injuries named, and not to award computed by addition of separate awards given for thumb and fingers individually.

       <p>
        In order for awards for unscheduled injuries under section 644 of this title and this section to be proportionate to the compensation for scheduled impairments, as is required, they must be computed with reference to the criteria underlying the awards for scheduled impairments, and those criteria address impairment to wage loss on a general, not individual, basis. Bishop v. Town of Barre, 140 Vt. 564, 442 A.2d 50 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where Commissioner of Labor and Industry evaluated disability of claimant for permanent disability benefits based upon an unscheduled injury without reference to the claimant's ability to work, the Commissioner's calculation of benefits was correct since individual economic capacity is rejected in this chapter and irrelevant to the evaluation of unscheduled injuries, the sole criterion of permanent disability being physical impairment.

        Under provision of subdivision (12) of this section that in no case shall amount received for loss of more than one finger exceed amount provided in schedule for loss of hand, it is intended that some portion of the thirty weeks by which compensation provided for loss of all fingers and thumb under subdivision (4) exceeds compensation provided in other subdivisions for loss of the several digits, shall be allocated to any loss of more than one finger, but within limitation that such extra compensation for loss of all five digits shall be 30 weeks.

        Both the permanent partial disability benefits statute and the American Medical Association Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition expressly allow evaluators to rate an impairment using the rating method set forth in a specific section of the Guides even if an individual's condition (or diagnosis) is not the condition (or diagnosis) for which that section is specifically designed. Brown v. W.T. Martin Plumbing & Heating, Inc., 194 Vt. 12, 72 A.3d 346 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        By deferring in the permanent partial disability benefits statute to the American Medical Association Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition with respect to the methodology for rating an impairment, the Vermont Legislature has not purported to remove from the Commissioner of the Department of Labor the discretion to consider conflicting competent expert opinions concerning the presence of an impairment. Brown v. W.T. Martin Plumbing & Heating, Inc., 194 Vt. 12, 72 A.3d 346 (2013).

        Section (b) of the statute pertaining to permanent partial disability benefits provides that the American Medical Association Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment (AMA Guides) are to be used only to determine "the existence and degree of permanent partial impairment." The issue of apportionment, which is an issue of workers' compensation policy rather than medical judgment, does not fall within this statutory language; furthermore, the AMA Guides do not require apportionment, and the Legislature specifically addressed apportionment in section (d) of the statute. Kapusta v. Dep't of Health/Risk Mgmt., 186 Vt. 276, 980 A.2d 236 (2009).

        Commissioner of the Department of Labor had a sufficient evidentiary basis to find that the claimant, who had undergone a hip replacement before she slipped on ice at work but had returned to normal activities and was taking no medication, had no functional impairment at the time she slipped on the ice. Kapusta v. Dep't of Health/Risk Mgmt., 186 Vt. 276, 980 A.2d 236 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        In deciding whether to apportion, the Commissioner of the Department of Labor could reach her own determination of the extent to which the claimant's hip replacement that she underwent before her work injury interfered with her ability to do her job and the extent of that ability after the work-related injury. The Commissioner's determination was supported by the evidence, and supported the conclusion that apportionment would be unjust because the claimant's hip replacement did not limit her work functionality. Kapusta v. Dep't of Health/Risk Mgmt., 186 Vt. 276, 980 A.2d 236 (2009).

         13. American Medical Association Guides.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court and the Labor Commissioner erred in concluding that the permanent partial disability benefits statute and the American Medical Association Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition precluded them, as a matter of law, from considering any evidence of claimant's impairment associated with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome. Brown v. W.T. Martin Plumbing & Heating, Inc., 194 Vt. 12, 72 A.3d 346 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the clear language of the permanent partial disability benefits statute, the Legislature has directed that the American Medical Association Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition are determinative with respect to "any determination of the existence and degree of permanent partial impairment" associated with an injury; permanent partial disability benefits are available for permanent impairments associated with an injury. Nowhere does the statute state that the Guides provide the exclusive mechanism for determining the existence of, or diagnosis associated with, a compensable injury; rather, the statute declares that the rating of an impairment is to be conducted pursuant to the Guides. Brown v. W.T. Martin Plumbing & Heating, Inc., 194 Vt. 12, 72 A.3d 346 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        To the extent that Chapter 16 of the American Medical Association Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition purports to establish fixed criteria for diagnosing Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS), as opposed to a method for rating the impairment associated with that condition, the permanent partial disability benefits statute does not imbue those criteria with the force of law. The Guides may be used as evidence to support expert testimony concerning the presence of CRPS, and a factfinder may choose to rely upon the criteria listed in Chapter 16 of the Guides in determining if a claimant has an injury and whether that injury is appropriately labeled "CRPS," but the Guides do not necessarily contain the exclusive authoritative standard for diagnosing the condition; in the face of competing opinions regarding diagnosis, a factfinder must exercise reasoned judgment in weighing the competing expert opinions. Brown v. W.T. Martin Plumbing & Heating, Inc., 194 Vt. 12, 72 A.3d 346 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislature in the permanent partial disability benefits statute has made it clear that its goal is not to ensure compliance with the American Medical Association Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition as an end in itself; rather, the Guides are a tool to promote the legislature's goal of ensuring that individuals who suffer permanent impairment as a result of work-related injuries receive appropriate permanent partial disability benefits. Brown v. W.T. Martin Plumbing & Heating, Inc., 194 Vt. 12, 72 A.3d 346 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Permanent partial disability benefits statute in its entirety reflects a clear statutory intent that no bona fide impairment should go uncompensated simply because the American Medical Association Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment, Fifth Edition fail to provide a method for assigning a rating to a particular condition. Instead, the statute specifically authorizes the Commissioner of the Department of Labor to develop methods for rating impairments not covered by the Guides, and the Commissioner has adopted a rule to ensure that impairments not expressly included in the Guides are rated and lead to compensation; accordingly, pursuant to the statutory scheme, individuals suffering from impairments not specifically described or listed in the Guides nonetheless may be entitled to an impairment rating and associated permanent partial disability benefits if supported by sufficient expert testimony. Brown v. W.T. Martin Plumbing & Heating, Inc., 194 Vt. 12, 72 A.3d 346 (2013).

         1. Causation.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        When used in a statute, "cause" is generally understood to mean proximate cause. This general rule holds true when "cause" appears in the intoxication defenses that are often part of workers' compensation statutes; in fact, the major disagreement in decisions addressing this exemption has been whether the intoxication must be the sole proximate cause or merely a major or primary cause. Cyr v. McDermott's, Inc., 187 Vt. 392, 996 A.2d 709 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Proximate cause analysis is not necessary in determining whether a worker is eligible for coverage; however, to be precluded, an employer must affirmatively show that intoxication played a role in causing the injury, either actively - "caused by" - or passively - "caused during." This interpretation of the statute listing injuries not covered by workers' compensation carries out the Legislature's intent to void compensation resulting from certain types of malfeasance; moreover, to understand "cause" in the statute to mean nothing more than "occur" creates a distinctly unjust and absurd outcome by barring lawful recovery for those workers whose injuries manifest outside the job. Cyr v. McDermott's, Inc., 187 Vt. 392, 996 A.2d 709 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        To uphold the legislative intent of barring recovery in cases of worker malfeasance without precluding other worthy claimants, determining the causal relationship between any malfeasance and the claimed injury is vital. Cyr v. McDermott's, Inc., 187 Vt. 392, 996 A.2d 709 (2010).

       </h5>
       <p>
        In a case where a workers' compensation claimant accidentally drank a caustic agent that was in a soda bottle he had taken home from work, his injury arose out of his employment when he accepted the bottle containing the caustic chemicals, and his alleged intoxication at the time he drank from the bottle did not bar his claim. His act of accepting the bottle at work put the mechanism of injury in motion, and no one suggested he was intoxicated at that time. Cyr v. McDermott's, Inc., 187 Vt. 392, 996 A.2d 709 (2010).

       Average weekly wages shall be computed in such manner as is best calculated to give the average weekly earnings of the worker during the 26 weeks preceding an injury; but where, by reason of the shortness of the time during which the worker has been in the employment, or the casual nature of the employment, or the terms of the employment, it is impracticable to compute the rate of remuneration, average weekly wages of the injured worker may be based on the average weekly earnings during the 26 weeks previous to the injury earned by a person in the same grade employed at the same or similar work by the employer of the injured worker, or if there is no comparable employee, by a person in the same grade employed in the same class of employment and in the same district. If during the period of 26 weeks an injured employee has been absent from employment on account of sickness or suspension of work by the employer, then only the time during which the employee was able to work shall be used to determine the employee's average weekly wage. If the injured employee is employed in the concurrent service of more than one insured employer or self-insurer the total earnings from the several insured employers and self-insurers shall be combined in determining the employee's average weekly wages, but insurance liability shall be exclusively upon the employer in whose employ the injury occurred. The average weekly wage of a volunteer firefighter, volunteer rescue or ambulance worker, volunteer reserve police officer, or volunteer as set forth in 3 V.S.A. §
    1101(b)(4), who is injured in the discharge of duties as a firefighter, rescue or ambulance worker, police officer, or State agency volunteer, shall be the employee's average weekly wage in the employee's regular employment or vocation but the provisions of section 642 of this title relative to maximum weekly compensation and weekly net income rates, shall apply. For the purpose of calculating permanent total or permanent partial disability compensation, the provisions relating to the maximum and minimum weekly compensation rate shall apply. In any event, if a worker at the time of the injury is regularly employed at a higher wage rate or in a higher grade of work than formerly during the 26 weeks preceding the injury and with larger regular wages, only the larger wages shall be taken into consideration in computing the worker's average weekly wages.

       In determining the compensation to be paid to any member of the National Guard or the Vermont State Guard, if that member is not regularly employed by some other person, it shall be assumed that the member is receiving income from a business or from other employment equivalent to wages in an amount one and one-half times the maximum compensation rate for total disability. If the wages received for the performance of duties as a member of the National Guard or Vermont State Guard exceed the wages received from a regular employer, that member shall be entitled to a rate of compensation based on wages received as a member of the National Guard or Vermont State Guard.

       When temporary disability, either total or partial, does not occur in a continuous period but occurs in separate intervals each resulting from the original injury, compensation shall be adjusted for each recurrence of disability to reflect any increases in wages or benefits prevailing at that time. For the purpose of computation, the adjustments shall be based upon the compensation received by a person in the same grade employed in the same class of employment and in the same district. The provisions of this section shall apply to compensable accidents occurring on and after July 1, 1973.

       Compensation computed pursuant to this section shall be adjusted annually on July 1, so that such compensation continues to bear the same percentage relationship to the average weekly wage in the State as computed under this chapter as it did at the time of injury.

       If weekly compensation benefits or weekly accrued benefits are not paid within 21 days after becoming due and payable pursuant to an order of the Commissioner, or in cases in which the overdue benefit is not in dispute, 10 percent of the overdue amount shall be added and paid to the employee, in addition to interest and any other penalties. In the case of an initial claim, benefits are due and payable upon entering into an agreement pursuant to subsection 662(a) of this title, upon issuance of an order of the Commissioner pursuant to subsection 662(b) of this title, or if the employer has not denied the claim within 21 days after the claim is filed. Benefits are in dispute if the claimant has been provided actual written notice of the dispute within 21 days of the benefit being due and payable and the evidence reasonably supports the denial. Interest shall accrue and be paid on benefits that are found to be compensable during the period of nonpayment. The Commissioner shall promptly review requests for payment under this section and, consistent with subsection 678(d) of this title, shall allow for the recovery of reasonable attorney's fees associated with an employee's successful request for payment under this subsection.

       When benefits have been awarded or are not in dispute as provided in subsection (e) of this section, the employer shall establish a weekday on which payment shall be mailed or deposited and notify the claimant and the Department of that day. The employer shall ensure that each weekly payment is mailed or deposited on or before the day established. Payment shall be made by direct deposit to a claimant who elects that payment method. The employer shall notify the claimant of his or her right to payment by direct deposit. If the benefit payment is not mailed or deposited on the day established, the employer shall pay to the claimant a late fee of $10.00 or five percent of the benefit amount, whichever is greater, for each weekly payment that is made after the established day. As used in this subsection, "paid" means the payment is mailed to the claimant's mailing address or, in the case of direct deposit, transferred into the designated account. In the event of a dispute, proof of payment shall be established by affidavit.

        Average weekly wages must be determined by dividing total amount earned by claimant during 12 weeks prior to injury by 12, regardless of fact that he was unemployed several weeks during such period by reason of economic conditions.

       <p>
        Shortness of the time of employment which would authorize resort to wages of another employee in computing average weekly wages of injured employee, means shortness of time which elapsed since claimant entered employ of his employer at time of injury; "employment" being construed according to context and approved usage of language.

       <p>
        In order to warrant resort to wages of another employee in computing average weekly wages because of the "terms of the employment," it must be shown not merely that economic or other conditions differentiate case from one occurring during normal or boom times, but also that such conditions applied differently or in greater degree to claimant than to his fellow workmen, and thus made his average earnings for twelve weeks prior to injury an unfair measure.

        Provision of subsection (a) of this section, that in instances where it is impracticable to compute employee's rate of remuneration, compensation can be based on earnings of other persons employed in the same work or by a person in the same grade and class of employment, does not apply where there are no wages at all, such as part-time student volunteer.

        In computing an average weekly wage for purposes of entitlement to disability benefits, profits from a business are not the equivalent of wages, and are no substitute for wages. Hotaling v. St. Johnsbury Trucking Co., 153 Vt. 581, 572 A.2d 1351 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Income received by an injured worker from a trash-hauling business started prior to his injury and continuing after award of temporary total disability benefits could not be used to reduce claimant's entitlement to temporary partial disability benefits; evidence of claimant's level of functioning and mobility supported finding of total disability, and provision calling for combining earnings from concurrent employment with insured employers or self-insurers was inapplicable on the record.

       <p>
        As an employer's cost in providing health insurance measured neither the employee's benefit nor his compensation because the costs were not tied to the employee's labors but instead, were based on factors unconnected to the employee, the employer's contribution for health insurance, though determinable, did not accurately reflect the employee's labors or compensation as defined through wages for purposes of the Workers' Compensation Act. Lydy v. Trustaff, Inc., 194 Vt. 165, 76 A.3d 150 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        As there was a split of authority with respect to whether fringe benefits were wages for the purpose of workers' compensation, and against the backdrop of Vermont Department of Labor's consistent interpretation of its own statute, other states' decisions were not compelling. Lydy v. Trustaff, Inc., 194 Vt. 165, 76 A.3d 150 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Commissioner of the Department of Labor properly concluded that allowing employer-paid health insurance benefits to be included in the average weekly wage calculation would upset the "delicate balance" that the law sought to maintain. Lydy v. Trustaff, Inc., 194 Vt. 165, 76 A.3d 150 (2013).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Commissioner's decision regarding the short-term disability benefits was erroneous because the claimant received two forms of wage replacement from her employer for the same injury, resulting in receipt of wage replacement greater than 100 percent of her wages; the employer made payments to the claimant under the terms of a collective bargaining agreement, as well as the retroactive temporary total disability payments it was ordered to make. Conant v. Entergy Corp., 202 Vt. 390, 149 A.3d 957 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Commissioner of Labor and Industry properly held that an overpayment of temporary disability benefits should be deducted from the claimant's permanent workmen's compensation award since the Commissioner is empowered to deduct from the amount to be paid as compensation the amount of prior payments that were not due and payable.

      After an injury and during the period of disability, if so requested by his or her employer, or ordered by the Commissioner, the employee shall submit to examination, at reasonable times and within a two-hour driving radius of the residence of the injured employee, by a duly licensed physician or surgeon designated and paid by the employer. The Commissioner may in his or her discretion permit an examination outside the two-hour driving radius if it is necessary to obtain the services of a provider who specializes in the evaluation and treatment specific to the nature and extent of the employee's injury. The employee may make a video or audio recording of any examination performed by the insurer's physician or surgeon or have a licensed health care provider designated and paid by the employee present at the examination. The employer may make an audio recording of the examination. The right of the employee to record the examination shall not be construed to deny to the employer's physician the right to visit the injured employee at all reasonable times and under all reasonable conditions during total disability. If an employee refuses to submit to or in any way obstructs the examination, the employee's right to prosecute any proceeding under the provisions of this chapter shall be suspended until the refusal or obstruction ceases, and compensation shall not be payable for the period which the refusal or obstruction continues.

        Under this section proceedings are not barred if claimant can show seasonable knowledge, and it is not necessary to show lack of prejudice as well. Fitch v. Parks & Woolson Machine Co., 109 Vt. 92, 191 A. 920 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section claimant has burden of showing either that employer had knowledge of injury or that employer was not prejudiced by want of or delay in claimant's giving notice thereof or in making for compensation, but that he need not show both.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Fourteen years after he reached a medical end result, despite the applicability of the workers' compensation rule governing procedure once an employee with a work-related injury reached a medical end result, a claimant for permanent partial disability benefits did not meet the Longe standard to avoid the applicable statute of limitations and therefore could not prevail on his claim. There had been no relevant statutory amendment; neither equitable estoppel nor equitable tolling applied in the face of the employer's inaction alone; and the court declined to modify the Longe holding to recognize that breach of a duty imposed by rule, and not by statute, had equal tolling effect. Smiley v. State, 198 Vt. 529, 117 A.3d 441 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Commissioner did not err in finding that claimant's permanent injury was not reasonably discoverable and apparent until the point of medical end result, and that his claim was therefore timely. Kraby v. Vermont Telephone Co., 177 Vt. 614, 868 A.2d 689 (mem.) (December 14, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Absent a statutory duty or circumstances sufficient to invoke doctrines of equitable estoppel or equitable tolling, an employer has no duty to inform an employee of his or her rights under the workers' compensation act. Longe v. Boise Cascade Corp., 171 Vt. 214, 762 A.2d 1248 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Employer was not required to pay permanent partial disability (PPD) benefits to injured employee, since employer was not barred from raising statute of limitations as a defense to payment of PPD benefits, as it had no duty to investigate employee's permanency status or inform him of his right to PPD benefits. Longe v. Boise Cascade Corp., 171 Vt. 214, 762 A.2d 1248 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Provisions relative to effect of faulty or delayed notice of injury apply only to notice of injury and not to claim for compensation, even though the notice and claim may be combined under section 658 of this title. Petraska v. National Acme Co., 95 Vt. 76, 113 A. 536 (1921).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Subsection (b) of this section applies to claims where the last injurious exposure to an occupational disease occurred prior to the date of enactment of the section but the time limitation for such a claim had not yet lapsed under repealed statute of repose, 21 V.S.A.
        §
        1006(a). Murray v. Luzenac Corp., 175 Vt. 529, 830 A.2d 1 (mem.) (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Nothing in subsection (b) implies an intent for the discovery rule to apply retroactively to occupational diseases. Carter v. Fred's Plumbing & Heating, Inc., 174 Vt. 572, 816 A.2d 1280 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because of the plain language of the former occupational disease law, and because the Legislature chose not to apply subsection (b) retroactively, plaintiff lacked a statutory or common law cause of action and his claim that he was denied a constitutional right to a remedy was without merit as it is within the Legislature's authority to define and limit a cause of action. Carter v. Fred's Plumbing & Heating, Inc., 174 Vt. 572, 816 A.2d 1280 (mem.) (2002).

       If the employer and an injured employee or the dependents of a deceased employee enter into an agreement in regard to compensation payable under the provisions of this chapter, a memorandum thereof shall be filed with the Commissioner.
    If approved by the Commissioner, such agreement shall be enforceable and subject to modification as provided by sections 668 and 675 of this title.
    The Commissioner shall approve such an agreement only when the terms thereof conform to the provisions of this chapter.
    However, a compromise agreement may be approved by the Commissioner when he or she is clearly of the opinion that the best interests of such employee or such dependents will be served thereby.
    A compromise settlement during pendency of an appeal to Superior Court or to Supreme Court shall be effective only with the approval of the Commissioner in accordance with this section.

       In the absence of an agreement pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the employer or insurance carrier shall notify the Commissioner and the employee in writing that the claim is denied and the reasons therefor. Upon the employee's application for a hearing under section 663 of this title, within 60 days, the Commissioner shall review the evidence upon which denial is based and if the evidence does not reasonably support the denial, the Commissioner shall order that payments be made until a hearing is held and a decision is rendered. Payments pursuant to this subsection shall not be deemed an admission of liability by the employer nor shall such payments preclude subsequent agreement under subsection (a) of this section or prejudice the rights of either party to hearing or appeal under this chapter. If the Commissioner's decision, after a hearing, is that the employee was not entitled to any or all benefits paid between the initial denial and the final decision, upon request of the employer, the Commissioner may order that the employee repay all benefits to which the employee was not entitled. The employer may enforce such a repayment order in any court of law having jurisdiction of the amount involved. Nothing in this section shall require the Commissioner to order payments pending a hearing if the Commissioner concludes that the benefit at issue is not compensable regardless of the lack of evidence supporting the denial. For the purposes of this section, any written communication by an unrepresented claimant that questions the denial of any benefit shall be deemed to be an application for hearing under section 663 of this title.

       Whenever payment of a compensable claim is refused, on the basis that another employer or insurer is liable, the Commissioner, after notice to interested parties and a review of the claim, but in no event later than 30 days, shall order that payments be made by one employer or insurer until a hearing is held and a decision is rendered. For the purposes of this review, the employer or insurer at the time of the most recent personal injury for which the employee claims benefits shall be presumed to be the liable employer or insurer and shall have the burden of proving another employer's or insurer's liability. Payments pursuant to this subsection shall not be deemed an admission or conclusive finding of an employer's or insurer's liability nor shall payments preclude subsequent agreement under subsection (a) of this section or prejudice the rights of either party to a hearing or appeal under this chapter.

       In any dispute between employers and insurers arising under subsection (c) or (d) of this section, after payment to the claimant, the Commissioner may order that the dispute be resolved through arbitration rather than the formal hearing process under sections 663 and 664 of this title. Qualifications for arbitrators and standards for the arbitration process shall be established by the Commissioner by rule. If arbitration is ordered, the process shall proceed as follows:

        Where minor, employed contrary to provisions of child labor law, thus making this chapter inapplicable, was injured, agreement of settlement under this section, and acceptance of payment thereunder, constituted no bar to common law action against employer.

       <p>
        Because the Commissioner can judge the constitutionality of her implementation of interim orders for payment of benefits under this section, dismissal of plaintiff insurance company's claims against Commissioner's implementation of the statute was appropriate. Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Wallis, 176 Vt. 167, 845 A.2d 316 (2003).

       <p>
        Plaintiff insurance company could bring a declaratory judgment action to challenge the constitutionality of the standard that "the evidence does not reasonably support the denial" of interim orders for payment of benefits in this section, and such a challenge is not an appeal requiring certification of questions of fact and law by the Commissioner.

        Nothing in the provision of this section governing the burden of proof in cases where payment of a compensable claim is refused on the basis that another employer or insurer is liable suggests that it is inapplicable if the insurer that refuses payment had paid in the past. Farris v. Bryant Grinder Corporation/Wausau Insurance Co., 177 Vt. 456, 869 A.2d 131 (January 14, 2005).

       <p>
        Workers' compensation insurer failed in its argument that the provision of this section governing the burden of proof in cases where payment of a compensable claim is refused on the basis that another employer or insurer is liable does not apply where the Commissioner's allocation decision is appealed to the superior court. Farris v. Bryant Grinder Corporation/Wausau Insurance Co., 177 Vt. 456, 869 A.2d 131 (January 14, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Provision of this section governing the burden of proof in cases where payment of a compensable claim is refused on the basis that another employer or insurer is liable required the Superior Court to assign the burden of proof to the successor insurer, and the Court erred in charging the jury that neither party bore that burden. Farris v. Bryant Grinder Corporation/Wausau Insurance Co., 177 Vt. 456, 869 A.2d 131 (January 14, 2005).

         4. Voiding of agreement.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Statute governing workers' compensation settlement agreements requires the Commissioner to consider whether a proposed agreement serves a claimant's best interests and authorizes the Commissioner to approve or reject an agreement only at the time it is initially presented. The statute does not give Commissioner authority to revisit and retract a settlement agreement at a later date or to void an agreement on public policy grounds alone. Therefore, it was error for Commissioner to void the general release language in the parties' settlement agreement on the grounds that it was impermissibly broad and violated public policy. Clayton v. J.C. Penney Corp., 206 Vt. 28, 177 A.3d 522 (2017).

If the Commissioner determines that mediation is appropriate, the Commissioner shall order the parties to attend at least one mediation session prior to a scheduled hearing.

       Whenever it appears that a dispute exists regarding the reasonableness and necessity of treatment for an injury, or regarding the claimant's ability to perform suitable work, including light duty work, or regarding any other medical issue, the Commissioner may appoint an independent medical examiner to examine the employee and report to the Commissioner. Whenever a dispute exists regarding the nature and extent of any permanent partial impairment which involves permanent partial disability ratings which differ by more than 10 percent, the Commissioner shall appoint an independent medical examiner to examine the employee and report to the Commissioner the examiner's opinion regarding the nature and extent of any permanent partial impairment. The opinion of the independent medical examiner as to degree of impairment shall be binding on the parties absent a showing of substantial error or omissions fraud or a gross departure from generally accepted medical practices. If a dispute involves permanent partial disability ratings which differ by 10 percent or less, the rating shall be determined by the Commissioner.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c09s667ol1b">
       A pool of independent medical examiners shall be established to perform independent medical examinations. Representatives of management and labor from the Governor's Advisory Council on Workers' Compensation, if available, otherwise other representatives of management and labor shall each submit a list of health care providers as proposed members of the pool. The Commissioner shall select the common names from both lists. If, in the opinion of the Commissioner, the number of independent medical examiners in the pool is not sufficient for any reason, or does not adequately represent a range of health care providers, the Commissioner shall select additional health care providers or request additional names. All health care providers in the pool shall receive training about the nature and purpose of workers' compensation and shall follow the guidelines developed by rule by the Commissioner. Where a dispute involves a determination of the degree of permanent partial disability, the independent medical examiner shall use the most recent edition of the American Medical Association Guides to the Evaluation of Permanent Impairment or the supplement provided by the Commissioner.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c09s667ol1c">
       The Commissioner shall determine fees to be paid to independent medical examiners for examinations pursuant to subsection 640(d) of this title. The fee shall be paid by the employer in an amount and proportion determined by the Commissioner.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c09s667ol1d">
       If a claimant fails or refuses to undergo an independent medical examination without good cause, the Commissioner may assess all or a part of the cost of the examination or any missed appointments against the claimant or may suspend payment of compensation to which the claimant may be entitled, or both.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c09s667ol1e">
       The independent medical examination report shall be admitted into evidence in any Superior Court appellate proceedings concerning the claim.

      <li id="t21c09s667ol1f">
       If an independent medical examiner is appointed, all parties to the dispute shall immediately provide the examiner with copies of all relevant medical records in their possession and shall assist the examiner in obtaining any other medical records deemed relevant to the proceedings.

     <p>
      Upon the Commissioner's own motion or upon the application of any party in interest upon the ground of a change in the conditions, or whenever doubts have arisen as to the jurisdiction of the Commissioner at the time the petition was presented, the Commissioner may at any time within six years of the date of award review any award by giving at least six days' notice thereof to the parties personally, or to the attorneys appearing in the cause. On such review, the Commissioner may make an order ending, diminishing, or increasing the compensation previously awarded, subject to the maximum or minimum provided in this chapter. If it appears that the petition for hearing was presented without previous authority or that for other reason the Commissioner did not have jurisdiction in the cause, the Commissioner may make an order striking off the award, and shall state conclusions of fact and rulings of law and immediately send to the parties a copy of the award. Such a review shall not affect any money already paid.

        An order granting summary judgment to five of six potentially liable parties was not a final order, and as such, the Commissioner's ruling in the case was properly amenable to revision; prior to the entry of a decision adjudicating all the relative claims and rights of the parties, the Commissioner could amend her ruling.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where injured employee and his employer had agreed on the amount of compensation pursuant to section 662 of this title, had filed a memorandum thereof and the amount agreed upon had been paid, Commissioner was without jurisdiction to reopen the case three years after filing of the settlement receipt on ground of changed conditions and order payment of additional compensation.

        Trial court was not required to speculate on meaning and scope of questions certified by Commissioner when such questions were so vague that their meaning and scope could not be determined with certainty, but would order certified questions returned to commissioner to be so amended that questions of fact to be retried might be made definite and certain.

       <p>
        Adjudicative body always has the power to determine whether it has subject matter jurisdiction over the dispute before it. It was therefore proper in a workers' compensation case for the Superior Court to address the threshold question of subject matter jurisdiction even though the question had been erroneously certified to it by the Commissioner of Labor. Stoll v. Burlington Elec. Dep't, 186 Vt. 127, 977 A.2d 1282 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a Superior Court is faced with an ambiguous certified question, it can, in its discretion, return the question to the Commissioner of Labor to be clarified. Nothing in this holding suggests that the Superior Court must - or even that it may - recast a question that is unambiguously purely legal as a question of fact or a mixed question in order to create jurisdiction.

        In evaluating a workers' compensation case, the trial court did not exceed its jurisdiction by granting summary judgment to the insurer; it was obligated to apply the rules of evidence and to determine if the expert testimony proffered by the claimant was relevant and admissible. The trial court was similarly obligated to apply the rules of civil procedure, including the summary judgment rule. Estate of George v.

       § 672. Appeals to the Supreme Court.
       <br />
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      If an appeal is not taken under the provisions of section 670 of this title within the time limited therefor, either party may transfer such cause to the Supreme Court.
    The jurisdiction of the Court shall be limited to a review of questions of law certified to it by the Commissioner.
    On such appeal or on an appeal taken as provided in sections 670 and 671 of this title and coming to the Supreme Court on appeal from Superior Court, the Supreme Court may render final judgment and award execution, or may remand the cause to the Superior Court or to the Commissioner for further findings or for new order by him or her in accordance with the mandate of the Court. The Court shall, by general rules, prescribe the procedure to be followed in case of such appeals.

        The courts may not consider equities between a claimant employee and the insurance carrier of an employer. Quinn v. Pate, 124 Vt. 121, 197 A.2d 795 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Review of the facts found by the Commissioner is confined to the issue of law relating to the sufficiency of the evidence to support the factual findings. Peabody v. Jones & Lamson Machine Co., 122 Vt. 431, 176 A.2d 759 (1961); Moody v. Humphrey & Harding, Inc., 127 Vt. 52, 238 A.2d 646 (1968).

       <p>
        Findings of the Commissioner are binding on the supreme court if supported by the evidence. Wroten v. Lamphere, 147 Vt. 606, 523 A.2d 1236 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        The findings of the Commissioner are binding upon the court if legally supported by evidence. Lapan v. Berno's Inc., 137 Vt. 393, 406 A.2d 390 (1979); Angolano v. City of South Burlington, 142 Vt. 131, 453 A.2d 402 (1982); Norse v. Melsur Corp., 143 Vt. 241, 465 A.2d 275 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Finding of Commissioner that workmen's compensation claimant had sustained an injury in course of and arising out of his or her employment was binding on Supreme Court on review and sustained award of compensation where finding was legally supported by the evidence. Moody v. Humphrey & Harding, Inc., 127 Vt. 52, 238 A.2d 646 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Findings of the Commissioner are binding upon appeal if sufficiently established by the evidence, and the burden is on the claimant to establish facts essential to the rights asserted. Quinn v. Pate, 124 Vt. 121, 197 A.2d 795 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Findings of commissioner, and all reasonable inferences drawn therefrom, must stand if evidence fairly and reasonably tends to support them, and weight of evidence is not for consideration on appeal. Kenney v. Rockingham School District, 123 Vt. 344, 190 A.2d 702 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Resolution of factual issues in workmen's compensation proceedings are for Commissioner, and his findings are conclusive and binding on the Supreme Court in the presence of evidentiary support. Peabody v. Jones & Lamson Machine Co., 122 Vt. 431, 176 A.2d 759 (1961); Moody v. Humphrey & Harding, Inc., 127 Vt. 52, 238 A.2d 646 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Findings of the Commissioner can be rejected as a matter of law only if the evidence upon which he acted had no probative worth, or proportionally was so slight as to be irrational as a basis for a finding, or if it appears that improper considerations substantially influenced the results. Jewell v. Olson Construction Co., 122 Vt. 434, 175 A.2d 509 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Finding by Commissioner that injury resulted from accident arising out of and in the course of employment will stand if supported by evidence, even though it may appear that degenerative processes were present in injured leg. Gee v. City of Burlington, 120 Vt. 472, 144 A.2d 797 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        Findings of the Commissioner, in cases within his jurisdiction, stand like those of a referee or master in that, if they are fairly and reasonably warranted by the evidence, they are conclusive and binding on appeal. Norman v. American Woolen Co., 117 Vt. 28, 84 A.2d 125 (1951); Morrisseau v. Legac, 123 Vt. 70, 181 A.2d 53 (1962); Goodwin v. Fairbanks, Morse & Co., 123 Vt. 161, 184 A.2d 220 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where findings of Commissioner did not show to whom burial expenses were paid, but Commissioner's certificate as to questions of law to be reviewed showed such expenses were paid "to the persons entitled to compensation and not to the personal representative of the deceased employee," formal findings were taken as supplemented by whatever additional facts appeared in such certificate. Barber v. Estey Organ Co., 100 Vt. 72, 135 A. 1 (1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        Findings of fact by Commissioner are conclusive on appeal, except as to whether there is sufficient evidence to support them. Kelley's Dependents v. Hoosac Lumber Co., 95 Vt. 50, 113 A. 818 (1921); Roller v. Warren, 98 Vt. 514, 129 A. 168 (1925); Norman v. American Woolen Co., 117 Vt. 28, 84 A.2d 125 (1951).

        Because the workers' compensation claimant appealed the Commissioner of Labor's decision denying her claim for temporary total disability benefits and vocational rehabilitation services to the Chittenden Superior Court pursuant to the statute governing appeals to the Superior Court, she was precluded from appealing directly to the Vermont Supreme Court under the statute governing appeals to the Supreme Court, and was now only entitled to review in the Supreme Court by appealing the Superior Court's decision.

       </p>
       <p>
        Because the rights to appeal workers' compensation decisions are circumscribed by statute, the Vermont Supreme Court does not have jurisdiction under the statute governing appeals to the Supreme Court when a party appeals to the Superior Court under the statute governing appeals to the Superior Court.

     <p>
      On petition and proof and in its discretion, the Supreme or Superior Court may grant leave to enter an appeal from an order of the Commissioner of Labor in cases where the petitioner has been prevented by fraud, accident or mistake from taking or entering an appeal within the time allowed by law.
    On granting the same, the court shall order such petitioner to give sufficient security to prosecute such appeal to effect and pay such costs as are awarded against him or her.

       <p>
        Vermont Supreme Court extends its holding in Merriam and explicitly preserves the catalyst theory as a possible route to attorneys' fees in workers' compensation cases. This accords with the Court's recognition that the workers' compensation statute is remedial and is to be construed broadly to further its purpose of making employees injured on the job whole. Bonanno v. Verizon Bus. Network Sys. & Sedgwick Claims Mgmt. Sys., 196 Vt. 62, 93 A.3d 146 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the catalyst theory, plaintiff prevailed on the issue of a medical bill and was entitled to attorneys' fees and costs. Defendants paid plaintiff's medical bill as a direct result of plaintiff's lawsuit to enforce the terms of a workers' compensation settlement agreement, and his claim was not frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless as a matter of law. Bonanno v. Verizon Bus. Network Sys. & Sedgwick Claims Mgmt. Sys., 196 Vt. 62, 93 A.3d 146 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        In plaintiff's action to enforce a workers' compensation settlement, the trial court's grant to plaintiff of $1,000 in attorneys' fees and $250 in costs for prevailing on the issue of a medical bill was not unreasonable, given the peripheral nature of the medical bill issue and plaintiff's unnecessary delay in providing discovery. Bonanno v. Verizon Bus. Network Sys. & Sedgwick Claims Mgmt. Sys., 196 Vt. 62, 93 A.3d 146 (2014).

        Subsection (b) of this section does not deny equal protection of the laws; it is reasonable for the legislature to have determined that an employer has greater capacity to assume legal expense on appeal and, thus, that it is fair for such an employer to pay the claimant's attorney fees even though the employer could not recover such fees if it prevailed.

        Where a party is entitled to attorney's fees by statute, it is not within the court's discretion whether to award such fees, but rather its task is to determine what constitutes reasonable fees in each instance. Perez v. Travelers Insurance, 181 Vt. 45, 915 A.2d 750 (November 17, 2006).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Defendant failed in its argument that a workers' compensation claimant's award should be limited to the terms of the contingency fee agreement she entered into with her attorney. Applying the "lodestar" method of calculation represents the reasonable worth of the services rendered in vindication of claimant's position, and is therefore appropriate given the statute's goal of alleviating the cost of litigation for prevailing claimants. Perez v. Travelers Insurance, 181 Vt. 45, 915 A.2d 750 (November 17, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislature could reasonably have determined that the allocation of fees set out by this section furthers the purpose of workers' compensation because employers and their insurance carriers are better able to bear the expense of hearings than employees. Hodgeman v. Jard Co., 157 Vt. 461, 599 A.2d 1371 (1991).
       </p>

        The main purpose of this section is to discourage unreasonable delay and unnecessary expense in the enforcement of a claim under this chapter. Kelley v.

        Pursuant to 21 V.S.A.
        §
        678(b) and Vt. R. App. P. 39(a), a workers' compensation claimant was entitled to costs and attorney's fees that the claimant incurred in an appeal to the State Supreme Court because the claimant was the prevailing party where the case was reversed and remanded with directions to make necessary findings and conclusions and to address the salient legal issue. McNally v. Department of PATH, 190 Vt. 590, 31 A.3d 333 (mem.) (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        The plain language of 21 V.S.A.
        §
        678 indicates that the Legislature
    intended to allow the award of attorney's fees to claimants who prevail in appellate
    proceedings, even in the absence of a final judgment on the underlying claim. McNally v. Department of PATH, 190 Vt. 590, 31 A.3d 333 (mem.) (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Employer could offset the sick wages paid to a workers' compensation claimant during a period of temporary total disability against the workers' compensation disability benefits it was ordered to pay for the same period. The claimant received all statutory disability benefits to which he was entitled; the ban against assignment was inapposite; and the employer's offset-credit policy did not compromise in any way the claimant's opportunity to seek attorney's fee reimbursement. Yustin v. Dep't of Pub. Safety, 189 Vt. 618, 19 A.3d 611 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (a) of this section does not prohibit the Commissioner of Labor from awarding attorney's fees in cases where the claimant has lost before the Commissioner but prevailed on appeal; rather, as shown in 21 V.S.A.
        §
        671, the Commissioner is required to treat the claimant's success at trial or on appeal as success before the Commissioner. Sargent v. Town of Randolph Fire Department, 182 Vt. 546, 928 A.2d 525 (mem.) (June 14, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Workers' compensation cases require specialized skills related to presentation of medical claims, which are uniquely dependent on technical evidence. In light of this, it is appropriate to consider prevailing market rates for trial litigation-in particular litigation where the plaintiff's medical condition is the crux of liability-as a starting point for the fee award. In presenting affidavits from attorneys with similar levels of experience and who practiced in personal injury law, claimant addressed the relevant standard. Perez v. Travelers Insurance, 181 Vt. 45, 915 A.2d 750 (November 17, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        The attorney's fee provision in a worker's compensation case shifts the burden of fees to the employer to discourage unreasonable delay and unnecessary expense in the prosecution or defense of claims. In light of the purposes of the fee-shifting provision, the Superior Court should have adjusted the amount that claimant requested to reflect a reasonable award under the circumstances rather than denying fees outright. Perez v. Travelers Insurance, 181 Vt. 45, 915 A.2d 750 (November 17, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where claimant submitted an itemized billing statement and affidavits from other attorneys providing a range of comparable billing rates, there was adequate evidence from which the Superior Court could have fashioned an award. Perez v. Travelers Insurance, 181 Vt. 45, 915 A.2d 750 (November 17, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a workers' compensation case, the Superior Court at most should have reduced a fee award only by the specific number of hours listed for entries that the court concluded were not reasonably related to the litigation or redundant. Perez v. Travelers Insurance, 181 Vt. 45, 915 A.2d 750 (November 17, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a workers' compensation case, the Superior Court erred in adopting defendant's argument that claimant was required to present supporting affidavits from practitioners specializing in workers' compensation cases. Perez v. Travelers Insurance, 181 Vt. 45, 915 A.2d 750 (November 17, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a workers' compensation appeal to the Supreme Court, a claimant is entitled to reasonable attorney's fees if he prevails. Coburn v. Frank Dodge & Sons, 165 Vt. 529, 687 A.2d 465 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Workers' Compensation Rule 10, which caps attorney fees at $35 per hour where a plaintiff is successful in a claim against a defendant, is authorized by 21 V.S.A.
        §
        602, which authorizes the Commissioner of Labor and Industry to issue rules, and is consistent with 21 V.S.A.
        <span class="s1">
         §
        </span>
        678, which allows recovery of reasonable attorney fees when a
    plaintiff prevails. Miller v. IBM, 163 Vt. 396, 659 A.2d 1126 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        21 V.S.A.
        §
        678(a) does not impose any limit on the fees an attorney may charge the client; instead, it and Workers' Compensation Rule 10 impose a limit on the amount of the claimant's attorney's fees which may be shifted to the employer. Miller v. IBM, 163 Vt. 396, 659 A.2d 1126 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (b) of 21 V.S.A.
        §
        678 governs an award for attorney's work done in the Superior and Supreme Courts and authorizes the Superior Court to determine a reasonable rate without regard to the Commissioner of Labor and Industry's limit. Miller v. IBM, 163 Vt. 396, 659 A.2d 1126 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although 21 V.S.A.
        §
        678(a) directs the Commissioner of Labor and Industry to award costs when the claimant prevails, it provides only an authorization that the Commissioner may award attorney fees so that the Commissioner has discretion under the section. Miller v. IBM, 163 Vt. 396, 659 A.2d 1126 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Decision of the trial court awarding attorney's fees of $75 per hour for representation both before the Commissioner of Labor and Industry and before appellate courts was remanded to permit the Commissioner to determine appropriate attorney's fee for work done at the administrative level. Jackson v. True Temper Corp., 156 Vt. 247, 590 A.2d 891 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Regulation promulgated by Commissioner of Labor and Industry limiting attorney's fees to a maximum of $35 per hour for matters before that agency did not apply to attorney's fees for representation of client before Superior Court or Supreme Court. Jackson v. True Temper Corp., 156 Vt. 247, 590 A.2d 891 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Notwithstanding that plaintiff had received maximum allowed attorney fees as set by Department of Labor and Industry's regulation in proceeding to adjudicate workers' compensation claim, the Supreme Court had authority under this section to award attorney fees and expenses of appeal. Coleman v. United Parcel Service, 155 Vt. 646, 582 A.2d 151 (mem.) (1990).

         5. Discretion of Commissioner.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The Commissioner of Labor could not be compelled to award attorney's fees because subsection (a) of this section makes clear that such an award is within the Commissioner's discretion. Sargent v. Town of Randolph Fire Department, 182 Vt. 546, 928 A.2d 525 (mem.) (June 14, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Commissioner of Labor and Industry has considerable discretion in awarding fees to prevailing claimants in workers' compensation cases, and is not constrained by the need for a showing that employer's defense caused unreasonable delay and unnecessary expense. Hodgeman v. Jard Co., 157 Vt. 461, 599 A.2d 1371 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Determination of reasonable attorney fees in workers' compensation cases lies within the discretion of the Commissioner of Labor and Industry, but counsel has the burden of providing evidence to justify an award. Hodgeman v. Jard Co., 157 Vt. 461, 599 A.2d 1371 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where Commissioner of Labor and Industry made an award of attorney's fees in workers' compensation case, with no evidentiary basis for the award of fees, and the award was calculated on a percentage basis, but was not to exceed $3,000, the award was within the Commissioner's sound discretion. Hodgeman v. Jard Co., 157 Vt. 461, 599 A.2d 1371 (1991).

       <p>
        Statute making workers' compensation claims not assignable excludes "compensation or claims therefor" from "all claims of creditors"; it makes no mention of tracing assets purchased with workers' compensation settlement funds and no such language can be reasonably implied. The Legislature plainly intended to protect an injured worker's income stream and his or her right to secure such income stream from creditors, not to protect that person's assets. Geraw v. Geraw, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (June 11, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the Legislature has intended to exempt property traceable to the receipt of certain benefits, it has said so explicitly. By omitting such language from the statute stating that workers' compensation are not assignable, the Legislature obviously left the question of a creditor's right to various assets to the specific provisions set forth in the statute exempting certain articles from attachment and execution. Geraw v. Geraw, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (June 11, 2021).

In addition, the employer shall be assessed an administrative penalty of not more than $250.00 for every day that the employer fails to secure workers' compensation coverage after the Commissioner issues an order to obtain insurance and may also be assessed an administrative penalty of not more than $250.00 for each employee for every day that the employer fails to secure workers' compensation coverage as required in section 687 of this title. When a stop-work order is issued, the Commissioner shall post a notice at a conspicuous place on the work site of the employer informing the employees that their employer failed to comply with the provisions of section 687 of this title and that work at the work site has been ordered to cease until workers' compensation insurance is secured. The stop-work order shall be rescinded as soon as the Commissioner determines that the employer is in compliance with section 687 of this title. An employer against whom a stop-work order has been issued is prohibited from contracting, directly or indirectly, with the State or any of its subdivisions for a period of up to three years following the date of the issuance of the stop-work order, as determined by the Commissioner in consultation with the Commissioner of Buildings and General Services or the Secretary of Transportation, as appropriate. Either the Secretary or the Commissioner, as appropriate, shall be consulted in any contest of the prohibition of the employer from contracting with the State or its subdivisions.

      Every policy of insurance and every guarantee contract covering the liability of an employer for compensation shall cover the entire liability of such employer to his or her employees covered by such policy or contract and also shall contain a provision setting forth the right of the employees to enforce, in their own names, the liability of the insurance carrier in whole or in part for the payment of such compensation, either by filing a separate claim at any time or by making at any time the insurance carrier a party to the original claim. However, the payment in whole or in part of such compensation by either the employer or the insurance carrier shall, to the extent thereof, be a bar to the recovery against the other of the amount so paid.

        The liability of an insurance carrier under this chapter is more than that of a mere indemnitor, being primary and direct, and the injured employee has the option of proceeding directly against the insurer as a party defendant. Marsigli's Estate v. Granite City Auto Sales, Inc., 124 Vt. 95, 197 A.2d 799 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        A company which insures the liability of an employer to pay compensation under this chapter thereby assumes the entire liability of the employer to pay such compensation. Morrisseau v. Legac, 123 Vt. 70, 181 A.2d 53 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        The liability of any party under this chapter, if once found to exist, is primary, and there can be no priority between two or more parties in such position. Morrisseau v. Legac, 123 Vt. 70, 181 A.2d 53 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        Liability of insurance carrier under this chapter is more than that of an indemnitor, being primary liability to injured employee to extent of employer's liability to injured employee. DeGray v. Miller Brothers Construction Co., 106 Vt. 259, 173 A. 556 (1934).

      An insurance carrier who does not intend to renew a workers' compensation insurance policy or guarantee contract covering the liability of an employer under the provisions of this chapter shall give notice of its intention to the Commissioner and the covered employer at least 45 days prior to the expiration date stated in the policy or contract. The notice shall be given to the employer by certified mail. An insurance carrier who fails to give notice shall continue the policy or contract in force beyond its expiration date for 45 days from the day the notice is received by the Commissioner and the employer. However, if, on or before the expiration of the existing insurance or guarantee contract the insurance carrier has, by delivery of a renewal contract or otherwise, offered to continue the insurance, or if the employer notifies the insurance carrier in writing that the employer does not wish the insurance continued beyond the expiration date, or if the employer complies with the provisions of section 687 of this title, then the policy will expire upon notice to the Commissioner.

       <p>
        Court rejected the argument of a claimant for unemployment benefits that the employer's violations of the workers' compensation reporting requirement and its arguable violation of the prohibition against employer-mandated polygraphs provided per se good cause for the claimant to quit her job. The referee and the Employment Security Board found that the claimant prematurely quit because she was offended by the employer's suggestion that she was lying about the circumstances surrounding her back injury, not because she felt threatened that she would be fired if she refused to take a polygraph test; furthermore, there was no evidence that the claimant faced having to forego her workers' compensation claim.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The obvious intent of subsection (a) of this section is to deter and sanction false claims for compensation, and to relieve employers from having to pay claims they would not otherwise be responsible for under the Workers' Compensation Act. Butler v. Huttig Bldg. Prods., 175 Vt. 323, 830 A.2d 44 (2003).

        .
       </h5>
       <p>
        By allowing the Commissioner of Labor and Industry to determine whether claimant should forfeit all or some of the benefits to which claimant is entitled, subsection (a) of this section also evidences an intent that the sanction be proportional, or have some relationship, to the claimant's fraud; thus, forfeiture must be no harsher than necessary to deter fraudulent claims and to ensure that the employer does not pay for a benefit to which the injured worker is not entitled. Butler v. Huttig Bldg. Prods., 175 Vt. 323, 830 A.2d 44 (2003).

         3. Penalty.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where claimant fraudulently sought reimbursement for expenses related to his medical treatment, falsified documents to increase the dosage of certain medications his doctors prescribed, and exaggerated his symptoms, the decision of the Commissioner of Labor and Industry denying him any additional medical and temporary disability benefits was reasonably related to the types of benefits he fraudulently sought. Butler v. Huttig Bldg. Prods., 175 Vt. 323, 830 A.2d 44 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where claimant was entitled by statute to permanent disability benefits according to the unchallenged finding of the Commissioner of Labor and Industry that his disability was permanent, the statute providing a penalty for false representation did not relieve his employer from its obligation to provide permanent disability benefits. Butler v. Huttig Bldg. Prods., 175 Vt. 323, 830 A.2d 44 (2003).

        Although generally an at-will employment contract may be terminated by either party to the contract at any time with or without cause, an exception to this general rule exists when the employer's alleged actions contravene public policy, and a private action by an employee against his employer is available where the employee claims that his supervisor discriminated against him in retaliation for his filing a workers' compensation claim.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in granting summary judgment to defendant on plaintiff's claim under subsection (b) where, because plaintiff could not carry her burden on her retaliatory-discharge claim of showing there was a causal connection between her seeking workers' compensation for her injuries and her termination, she also could not meet the threshold warranting a mixed-motives analysis, as this burden is greater than the level of proof necessary to make out a pretext prima facie case. Wentworth v. Fletcher Allen Health Care, 171 Vt. 614, 765 A.2d 456 (mem.) (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action by an employee claiming an employer discriminated against him in retaliation for his filing a workers' compensation claim, the employer offered a legitimate, nondiscriminatory reason for imposing disciplinary measures but the timing of the alleged discriminatory treatment of the employee relative to his filing of the workers' compensation claim was sufficient to show a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment decisions; consequently, summary judgment was not appropriate where genuine issues of material fact remained concerning whether the employee was discriminated against for filing a workers' compensation claim and whether the severity of the disciplinary action was the result of discriminatory disparate treatment. Murray v. St. Michael's College, 164 Vt. 205, 667 A.2d 294 (1995).

        §§
        201-219, the court had supplemental jurisdiction pursuant to 28 U.S.C.S.

        </b>
        .
       </h5>
       <p>
        When plaintiff was terminated within several months of his claim for workers' compensation benefits and within weeks of his return to work from the injury, this temporal proximity between the adverse employment decision and the protected activity was sufficient under the burden-shifting analysis to meet his initial relatively light burden of establishing the causation portion of a prima facie case for workers'-compensation retaliation. Gauthier v. Keurig Green Mt., Inc., 200 Vt. 125, 129 A.3d 108 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        To withstand a summary judgment on a claim that an employee was discriminated against for filing a workers' compensation claim, the employee must present a prima facie case of retaliatory discrimination showing (1) he was engaged in a protected activity, (2) his employer was aware of that activity, (3) he suffered adverse employment decisions, and (4) there was a causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse employment decision.

         5. Release.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In a workers' compensation retaliation case, remand was required for the trial court to address the effect of an agreement executed by plaintiff which contained a release. The state consistently and repeatedly argued that plaintiff waived any claims against the state based on his reclassification, and the trial court's failure to resolve this issue was fatal to the validity of the ensuing jury verdict because, for the most part, plaintiff's retaliation claim was grounded on actions taken by the state pursuant to the agreement, apart from which there was insufficient support for the verdict.

         6. Video surveillance.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        One-day public video surveillance of plaintiff done in connection with plaintiff's workers' compensation claim could not, as a matter of law, support his retaliation claim. Such surveillance could be expected in response to a tip claiming fraud, regardless of the tip's source, and the court could not see how it would cause a reasonable person to forego a legitimate claim. Hall v. State, 192 Vt. 63, 54 A.3d 993 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        State has the right and responsibility to use video surveillance techniques to prevent fraudulent workers' compensation claims. If any video surveillance in connection with a workers' compensation claim could form the sole basis for a retaliation claim, it could well have the effect of pressuring the state into abandoning or unnecessarily restricting one of its legitimate tools for rooting out fraud in the filing of workers' compensation claims.

       <p>
        When defendant in a workers' compensation retaliation case produced evidence that plaintiff violated its internet-use policy and had been involved in two other internal disciplinary proceedings in the past, including a previous warning for a violation of defendant's internet-use policy, defendant's proffered reason would permit the conclusion that plaintiff was terminated for a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In order to establish pretext in a workers' compensation retaliation case, the employee must call the employer's honesty or credibility into question by rebutting the proffered reason with facts from which a factfinder could reasonably conclude that the proffered reasons are unworthy of credence. The proffered reason that the employer honestly believes must, of course, be a legitimate, non-discriminatory reason for the challenged adverse employment action. Gauthier v. Keurig Green Mt., Inc., 200 Vt. 125, 129 A.3d 108 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        With regard to his workers' compensation retaliation claim, plaintiff had not shown that defendant's terminating him for excessive internet usage was pretextual in that defendant did not honestly believe in its proffered reason, given that nothing suggested that another worker had used plaintiff's login credentials for an extended period of time or for accessing the internet, the evidence did not show that plaintiff could not have performed his job while using the internet as alleged, and there was no evidence that defendant lacked an honest belief as to the content of a usage report.

       Following the referral of a complaint by the Commissioner of Labor pursuant to the provisions of section 3 of this title, the Attorney General may investigate a complaint that an employer has committed a willful, substantial, or systemic violation of section 687 or 708 of this chapter by claiming that it is not an employer as defined pursuant to subdivision 601(3) of this chapter or that an individual is not a worker or employee as defined pursuant to subdivision 601(14) of this chapter and may enforce those provisions by restraining prohibited acts, seeking civil penalties, obtaining assurances of discontinuance, and conducting civil investigations in accordance with the procedures established in <cite class="vt-code">9 V.S.A. §§ 2458</cite>-2461 as though an employer that violates section 687 or 708 of this chapter by claiming that it is not an employer as defined pursuant to subdivision 601(3) of this chapter or that an individual is not a worker or employee as defined pursuant to subdivision 601(14) of this chapter is committing an unfair act in commerce. Any employer, employment agency, or labor organization complained against shall have the same rights and remedies as specified in <cite class="vt-code">9 V.S.A. §§ 2458</cite>-2461. The Superior Court may impose the same civil penalties and investigation costs and order other relief to the State of Vermont or an aggrieved employee for a violation of section 687 or 708 of this chapter and any related violations of the provisions of this chapter as they are authorized to impose or order under the provisions of 9 V.S.A. §§ 2458 and 2461 in an unfair act in commerce. In addition, the Superior Court may order restitution of wages or other benefits on behalf of an employee and may order reinstatement and other appropriate relief on behalf of an employee.

The fees shall be used, in conjunction with other approved funds, to provide classroom instruction primarily for Vermont registered apprentices.

     This chapter must be construed liberally in favor of claimants to remove economic disabilities and distress resulting from involuntary unemployment, and to assist those workers who become jobless for reasons beyond their control, and should not exclude a claimant unless such an exclusion is clearly intended by law. Howard v. Department of Employment & Training, 153 Vt. 614, 572 A.2d 931 (1990).

     The Supreme Court is not free to enlarge the scope of this chapter by an unwarranted interpretation of statutory language, nor is it at liberty to read into it provisions which the legislature did not see fit to incorporate. Littlefield v. Department of Employment & Training, 145 Vt. 247, 487 A.2d 507 (1984).
    </p>
    <p>
     This chapter, having benevolent objectives, is remedial and must be given liberal construction; no claimant should be excluded unless the law clearly intends such an exclusion. Jones v. Department of Employment Security, 140 Vt. 552, 442 A.2d 463 (1982).
    </p>
    <p>
     As unemployment compensation is remedial legislation, no person shall be excluded from its benefits unless the law demonstrates an intent to make the exclusion. Anthony Adams AIA Architect v. Department of Employment Security, 139 Vt. 413, 430 A.2d 446 (1981).
    </p>
    <p>
     This chapter is designed as remedial legislation, and as such is to be construed in accordance with its express goal of removing economic disabilities, and no person, therefore, should be excluded from benefits unless the chapter itself reveals a clear intention to make such an exclusion. Jenkins v. Department of Employment Security, 135 Vt. 210, 373 A.2d 533 (1977).

     This chapter, as remedial legislation, is to be construed liberally in favor of a claimant. Grenafege v. Department of Employment Security, 134 Vt. 288, 357 A.2d 118 (1976); Littlefield v. Department of Employment & Training, 145 Vt. 247, 487 A.2d 507 (1984).
    </p>
    <p>
     Since this chapter is remedial legislation, a claimant should not be excluded from its provisions unless such an exclusion is clearly intended by law. Wallace v. Department of Employment Security, 134 Vt. 513, 365 A.2d 517 (1976); Donahue v. Department of Employment Security, 142 Vt. 351, 454 A.2d 1244 (1982); Littlefield v.

     As remedial legislation, this chapter is to be interpreted in line with its benevolent objectives; therefore, no claimant should be excluded from its provisions unless the law clearly intends such exclusion. Nolan v. Davidson, 134 Vt. 295, 357 A.2d 129 (1976); Porter v. Department of Employment Security, 139 Vt. 405, 430 A.2d 450 (1981).

      2. Purpose.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     The underlying purposes of this chapter are to remove economic disabilities and distress resulting from involuntary unemployment, and to assist those workers who become jobless for reasons beyond their control. Littlefield v. Department of Employment & Training, 145 Vt. 247, 487 A.2d 507 (1984).
    </p>
    <p>
     This chapter was intended to aid those whose joblessness is involuntary. Webster v. Department of Employment & Training, 141 Vt. 591, 451 A.2d 1104 (1982).
    </p>
    <p>
     The general purpose of this chapter is to alleviate the economic disability and distress which results from involuntary unemployment; therefore, no person should be excluded from its benefits unless this chapter itself, in so many words, has demonstrated an intent to create such an exclusion. Riddel v. Department of Employment Security, 140 Vt. 82, 436 A.2d 1086 (1981).
    </p>
    <p>
     The underlying purpose of this chapter is to remove the economic disabilities resulting from involuntary unemployment. In re Potvin, 132 Vt. 14, 313 A.2d 25 (1973).
    </p>
    <p>
     The standards of this chapter must be applied consistent with its purpose of removing economic disabilities and distress resulting from involuntary unemployment. In re Platt, 130 Vt. 329, 292 A.2d 822 (1972).
    </p>
    <p>
     The purpose of this chapter is to compensate for lack of appropriate job vacancies, thereby relieving distress resulting from unemployment and subsequent economic insecurity. Nurmi v. Vermont Employment Security Board, 124 Vt. 42, 197 A.2d 483 (1963), overruled on other grounds, Shufelt v. Department of Employment & Training (1987) 148 Vt. 163, 531 A.2d 894.
    </p>
    <p>
     This chapter is intended to assist unemployed persons who, under the limitations and conditions imposed by the legislature, are entitled to its benefits. Nurmi v. Vermont Employment Security Board, 124 Vt. 42, 197 A.2d 483 (1963), overruled on other grounds, Shufelt v. Department of Employment & Training (1987) 148 Vt. 163, 531 A.2d 894.
    </p>
    <p>
     It is not the purpose of this chapter to provide sick benefits nor to compensate those who cease working because of illness. Willard v. Vermont Unemployment Compensation Commission, 122 Vt. 398, 173 A.2d 843 (1961).

      3. Disbursement of funds.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     Disbursement of unemployment compensation funds can be made only within the limits imposed by this chapter and a claim must be justifiable under this chapter. In re Platt, 130 Vt. 329, 292 A.2d 822 (1972).
    </p>
    <p>
     While this chapter must be given a liberal construction to subserve its beneficent social policy, it is equally important that it not be administered or construed in a manner dissipative of monies not intended by the Legislature to be disbursed without satisfaction of specific prerequisites. In re Moore, 128 Vt. 581, 269 A.2d 853 (1970).

        To rebut the presumption that all persons who receive wages from an employer are presumed to be employees and are therefore entitled to unemployment benefits, and to avoid responsibility for unemployment compensation assessments, an employer must prove that its workers meet all three elements of the statutory exception commonly known as the "ABC test" under subdivision (6)(B) of this section.

       </p>
       <p>
        For an employer to satisfy the provision of subdivision (6)(B) of this section, exempting service performed by an individual for wages from assessment for unemployment compensation contributions, all three conditions of the statutory test (customarily called the "ABC" test) must be met, and an inability to satisfy any one will result in the conclusion that the relationship constitutes employment for purposes of this section. Vermont Institute of Community Involvement, Inc. v. Department of Employment Security, 140 Vt. 94, 436 A.2d 765 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Exemption from employment under subdivision (6)(B) of this section is established only if all conditions are met, and the failure to demonstrate even one condition will result in the determination of the entitlement to benefits.

        For purposes of assessing unemployment insurance taxes, an individual who was a corporate officer effectively managed and directed herself or others performing bookkeeping services on behalf of the employer, and therefore did not satisfy the part of the statutory test requiring freedom from the employer's "control or direction."

        Workers making clothing at home performed a unique job, producing the specific product the company sold under the direction and control of the company. Thus, the decision of the Employment Security Board that the workers were employees for purposes of assessing unemployment taxes on the company was consistent not only with the statute and the court's precedents, but also with the remedial purpose of the unemployment laws.

        Subdivision (6)(B)(i) of this section, exempting service performed by an individual for wages from assessment for unemployment compensation contributions where the individual has been and will continue to be free from control or direction over the performance of services, does not require that actual control be exercised by the employer; the mere right of control is all that is contemplated.

        With regard to the part of the test addressing whether a worker is "customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business," the conclusion that workers could not have their own businesses if they were also 40-hour-a-week employees for other entities was not logical because nothing in the statute requires the workers to be engaged full-time in their independent business or trade.

        Where a worker who made clothing at home also worked 40 hours a week as a respite care worker, this latter work was not similar to the work she did for the clothing company, and it was error for the Employment Security Board to consider it in deciding the issue whether the worker was "customarily engaged in an independently established trade, occupation, profession or business"; the section requires workers to be "independently established providing the same or similar services as they provide for the employer."

        Worker was an independent contractor under the "ABC test," and appellant was therefore not liable for unemployment insurance taxes as to him, when he declined an offer of employment from appellant, set his own schedule, worked without supervision, was free to accept or decline work, used his own specialized equipment, purchased his own materials, sometimes supplied materials to other contractors, negotiated his own pay schedules on a project-to-project basis, and worked outside the usual course of appellant's general contracting business in that he performed highly specialized restoration work. The determination that he was independently established had not been challenged. Great N. Constr., Inc. v. Dep't of Labor, 204 Vt. 1, 161 A.3d 1207 (Dec. 9, 2016).

        Appellant was liable for unemployment taxes as to four of its workers, as the work of carpenters, concrete-siding installers, and painters was necessary and central to the business of building homes, appellant was not only in the business of designing homes and organizing the construction process, but was also in the business of building and selling the homes that it designed, and the services performed by the four workers at issue were not outside the usual course of appellant's business.

       <p>
        Worker failed the "independently established" prong of the ABC test, and thus was deemed an employee for whom appellant was required to pay unemployment insurance taxes, in that the record suggested any work he did for others was sporadic and subordinate to that he did for appellant, he was new to the construction business in Vermont, he was not registered as an independent business, he did not file a Schedule C tax form, and he advertised only by word of mouth. The fact that appellant took no action against the worker when he declined to work on a mural project due to his religious beliefs showed nothing more than that appellant was mindful of its potential obligations under federal law.

        Because appellant's pre-disability wages had already been used to meet his monetary eligibility requirement for the unsuccessful unemployment claims he had filed beginning in December 2014, which had established a benefit year for those claims even though he did not get any unemployment benefits at that time for other reasons, they could not be used again for his 2017 unemployment claim.

        Even if a claimant's benefit period began on February 2, 2016, when the claimant called the Unemployment Division after realizing that her worker's compensation benefits had stopped, instead of when she first called the Unemployment Division in May 2015, she would not have been monetarily eligible for unemployment benefits under any of the four monetary methods provided by law because she would have received nothing since February 2, 2016 was more than six months after March 20, 2015.

         1. Purpose.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Purpose behind statute prohibiting disclosure of unemployment compensation information is to encourage full, free and honest reporting to Department of Employment and Training, by protecting identities and statements of both employers and employees. Haverly v. Kaytec, Inc., 169 Vt. 350, 738 A.2d 86 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of subsection (c) of this section is to insure that the Department of Employment and Training receives accurate and timely information on which to base its decision regarding benefits. Trombley v. Department of Employment & Training, 146 Vt. 332, 503 A.2d 537 (1985).

         2. Inaccurate reports.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Sanctions under subsection (c) of this section are applicable when an employer has filed a timely but inaccurate report. Trombley v. Department of Employment & Training, 146 Vt. 332, 503 A.2d 537 (1985).

        <b>
         3. Privilege.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Employee suing for constructive discharge could not claim protection from disclosure of unemployment information and, at the same time, bring an action for damages putting content of his statements directly at issue, since to do so would be to use statutory privilege as a sword as well as a shield; by bringing suit and putting his reasons for leaving job at issue, employee waived any protection he may have had under statute with respect to statements made by him in applying for unemployment benefits. Haverly v. Kaytec, Inc., 169 Vt. 350, 738 A.2d 86 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section, creating a statutory absolute privilege for communications by an employer or employee to the Commissioner of the Department of Employment and Training regarding applications for unemployment compensation benefits, shows that Vermont recognizes a confidential communications privilege to parties outside the intra-corporate context. Marcoux-Norton v. Kmart Corp., 907 F. Supp. 766 (D. Vt. 1993).

       References to "Social Security Board" were changed to "Secretary of Labor" and "created by the Social Security Act approved August 14, 1935, as amended" following the first such reference was deleted to conform language to reorganization of federal government.
    Section 4 of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1946 abolished the Social Security Board and transferred all of its functions to the federal security administrator.
    Section 1 of Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1949 transferred the functions of the federal security administrator relating to unemployment compensation to the secretary of labor.

       <p>
        "Valid claim" for unemployment compensation benefits was established by a determination of monetary eligibility at the time that an initial claim was filed, at which time the liability of the employer was established; a reimbursable employer was then responsible for payments towards the employee's unemployment compensation without the need for any new adjudication of that liability. Windham County Sheriff's Dep't v. Dep't of Labor, 195 Vt. 1, 86 A.3d 410 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Former employee who made a "valid claim" when he filed for unemployment compensation benefits continued to hold onto it, although temporary disqualification was then imposed, and upon his satisfaction of the temporary disqualification requirements he was eligible for benefits, such that the employer was automatically liable for reimbursement payments; the employer's obligation was governed by the law in force at the time of the initial claim. Windham County Sheriff's Dep't v. Dep't of Labor, 195 Vt. 1, 86 A.3d 410 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        By disbursing all the funds awarded to a former employee, the Employment Security Board deprived a town employer of any financial stake in the outcome of its appeal from the Board's decision because, even if the town were to prevail, the Department of Employment and Training would exercise its statutory authority to collect reimbursement from the town for all the benefits "paid but denied on appeal" to the employee, and the town did not need to fear further liability as a result of the Board's decision because of the provision of 21 V.S.A.
        §
        1353 prohibiting the collateral use of "[a]ny determination, redetermination, finding of fact, conclusion of law, decision, final order, or final judgment entered or made by . . . the employment security board" in any "separate or subsequent action"; accordingly, the town's appeal was moot for lack of any stake in its outcome. Holton v. Department of Employment and Training, 178 Vt. 147, 878 A.2d 1051 (April 1, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        By enacting the provision making noncontributing employers liable to the Department of Employment and Training for "benefits paid but denied on appeal," the Legislature expressly contemplated that benefits would be paid pending appellate review, and that benefits paid might later be denied. Holton v. Department of Employment and Training, 178 Vt. 147, 878 A.2d 1051 (April 1, 2005).

        Provision making noncontributing employers liable to the Department of Employment and Training for "benefits paid but denied on appeal" does not conflict with the right of appeal to the Supreme Court in 21 V.S.A.
        §
        1349; furthermore, the latter provision applies generally to all parties, including employees, contributing employers, and noncontributing employers and of these three, only noncontributing employers will face potential mootness problems. Holton v. Department of Employment and Training, 178 Vt. 147, 878 A.2d 1051 (April 1, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Requirement that noncontributing employers reimburse the Department of Employment and Training for any benefits "paid but denied on appeal" does not violate the equal protection clause of the United States Constitution.

         4. Reimbursement of fund.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Because under the provision governing employers who chose to reimburse the Unemployment Compensation Fund for benefits paid rather than contribute to the Fund, employers who chose reimbursement were not entitled to benefits paid but denied on appeal, appellant had no due process property interest in the benefits paid to a former employee in the window between the allowance of benefits and the reversal of that decision. Chittenden County Sheriff's Dep't v. Dep't of Labor, 211 Vt. 377, 228 A.3d 85 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because appellant chose to reimburse the Unemployment Compensation Fund for benefits paid rather than to contribute to the Fund, and the provision governing such employers mandated that they compensate the Fund for benefits that were paid but subsequently denied on appeal, the Vermont Employment Security Board was bound to find appellant responsible for the benefits paid but denied on appeal. As a result, there was no discretion on the Board's part and no delegation of legislative power to the Board; accordingly, no violation of separation of powers and no denial of due process or equal protection could have resulted from the same. Chittenden County Sheriff's Dep't v. Dep't of Labor, 211 Vt. 377, 228 A.3d 85 (2020).

       Every employer subject to this chapter who sells in bulk 50 percent or more of his or her assets, including any stock of goods, wares, or merchandise of any kind, fixtures, machinery, equipment, buildings, or real estate, when such sale constitutes the sale of the employer's business to another shall give the Commissioner 10 days' notice of the sale before the completion of the transfer of the property. The employer shall file all contribution reports with the Commissioner to the date of the proposed transfer of property and pay all contributions, interest, and penalties due and payable thereon.
    The employer shall also file the detailed quarterly wage report required by section 1314a of this title (subsequent to June 30, 1986) covering employee wages to date of proposed transfer.
    When the reports are filed the Commissioner shall furnish to the employer within 10 days thereafter a certificate showing that all reports have been filed and contributions, interest, and penalties paid to the date of the proposed transfer.
    If the certificate is not furnished by the Commissioner within 10 days no liability may thereafter be imposed upon the purchaser.
    The employer shall present the certificate to the purchaser of the property.
    The failure of the purchaser to require the certificate makes the purchaser liable to the Commissioner for the unpaid contributions, interest, and penalties owed by the employer in an amount not to exceed the reasonable value of the assets purchased.

    Failure to comply with the provisions of this section shall render said contractor directly liable for such contributions, penalties, and interest due from said subcontractor and the Commissioner shall have all of the remedies of collection against said contractor under the provisions of this chapter as though the services in question were performed directly for said contractor.
    Any such contractor who shall become liable for and pay contributions with respect to individuals in the employ of any such subcontractor may recover the same from such subcontractor. For the purpose of this section, the words "contractor" and "subcontractor" mean and include individuals, partnerships, firms or corporations, or other associations of persons engaged in the business of construction, alteration, repairing, dismantling, or demolition of buildings, roads, bridges, viaducts, sewers, water and gas mains, streets, disposal plants, water filters, tanks and towers, airports, dams, water wells, pipelines, and every other type of structure, project, development, or improvement coming within the definition of real property.

       <p>
        Doctrine of collateral estoppel barred employer from relitigating successor status determination regarding its purchase of another business, which resulted in increase in rate at which it was required to contribute to unemployment compensation fund, where administrative proceedings provided employer full and fair opportunity to raise arguments concerning determination, employer did in fact raise those arguments, which were considered and rejected by Employment Security Board on their merits, and employer failed to timely appeal board's decision rejecting its arguments. Sheehan v. Department of Employment & Training, 169 Vt. 304, 733 A.2d 88 (1999).

       The Commissioner shall for each rate year compute a benefit ratio for each employer who meets the requirements of section 1327 of this title.
    For an employer whose record has been chargeable with benefits throughout the three consecutive calendar years immediately preceding the rate year for which the ratio is computed, the benefit ratio shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the total benefits charged to his or her record in such three years by the total of his or her taxable payrolls for the same three-year period; for an employer whose record has been chargeable with benefits for at least one but less than three consecutive calendar years immediately preceding the rate year for which the ratio is computed, the benefit ratio shall be the quotient obtained by dividing the total benefits charged to his or her record for such calendar year or years by the total of his or her taxable payrolls for the same period.
    The contribution rate of each employer, not otherwise ineligible, who meets the requirements of section 1327 of this title, shall be determined under subsections (b) through (g) of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c17sub01s1326ol1b">
       The Commissioner shall prepare a schedule on which he or she shall list all employers for whom a benefit ratio has been computed pursuant to this section, in the order of their benefit ratios, beginning with the lowest such ratio, and on which shall be shown with respect to each such employer:
       <ol>
        <li id="t21c17sub01s1326ol1b1">

      <li id="t21c17sub01s1326ol1c">
       The Commissioner shall segregate employers so listed into classes in accordance with the cumulative payrolls.
    The classes shall be determined by the cumulative payroll percentage limits set forth in column B of the table below. Each such class shall be identified by the rate class number in column A that is opposite the figures in column B that represents the percentage limits of each class.
    In the event an employer's taxable payroll falls in more than one rate class, he or she shall be assigned to the lower numbered rate class except that no employer shall be assigned to a higher rate class than is assigned any other employer with the same benefit ratio.

         The current fund ratio shall be determined by dividing the available balance of the Unemployment Compensation Fund on December 31 of the preceding calendar year by the total wages paid for employment during that calendar year as reported by employers by the following March 31.

           (2) (A) The highest benefit cost rate shall be determined by dividing the highest amount of benefit payments made during a consecutive 12-month period that ended within the 10-year period ending on the preceding December 31, by the total wages paid during the four calendar quarter periods that ended within that 12-month period.

      Any employer against whom an assessment is made may, within 30 days after date thereof, file with the Commissioner a petition for a hearing before a referee appointed for such purpose, which petition shall set forth specifically and in detail the grounds upon which it is claimed the assessment is erroneous. Hearing or hearings on the assessment shall be held by the referee at such times and places as may be provided by rules and regulations of the Board and due notice of the time and place of such hearing or hearings shall be given by ordinary or certified mail to the petitioner.

    Such judgment shall have the same effect, and all proceedings in relation thereto shall thereafter be the same, as though such judgment had been rendered in an action duly heard and determined by such court, provided, however, there shall not be an appeal therefrom except on matters of law heard and determined in such court.

    The warrant shall command the sheriff to levy upon and sell the real and personal property of any person liable for unpaid contributions, payments, interest, penalties, and costs due under this chapter, for payment of the amount due and the cost of executing the warrant, and to return the warrant to the Commissioner and to pay him or her the money collected by virtue of the warrant within 60 days after receipt of the warrant.
    The sheriff shall within five days after receipt of the warrant file with the county clerk a copy of the warrant, and the clerk shall then enter in the judgment docket the name of the person liable, the amount of the contributions, payments, interest, penalties, and costs for which the warrant is issued and the date when the copy is filed.
    The levy and sale shall be effected in the manner prescribed for levy of execution. If a warrant is returned not fully satisfied, the Commissioner may from time to time issue new warrants for the balance due in accordance with the procedure described hereinabove.

       All contributions, interest, penalties, and costs thereon due and payable by an employer under the provisions of this chapter shall be a lien upon the real estate of such employer from the date a lien for such contributions, interest, penalties, and costs is entered in the land records of the town in which is located real estate of the employer.
    A lien for such contributions, penalties, interest, and costs shall be created upon the personal property or franchises of the employer if such lien is recorded in the town clerk's office of the town in which the employer resides; and, if the employer is a corporation or a co-partnership, then such lien on the franchises or personal property of such employer shall be recorded in the town clerk's office in the town in which such employer has its principal place of business in the State.
    Liens created under this section shall show name of employer, amount of contributions, and other indebtedness due to the Commissioner of Labor. A lien created under this section shall be a lien prior to all other liens except liens created for taxes due the State of Vermont, the federal government, or town or municipality in this State and wage claims.
    Such lien shall not be a prior lien to liens on record prior to the recording of the lien provided for herein.

       When the contributions, interest, penalties, and costs, secured by a lien in accordance with this section, remains unpaid for 90 days after the creation of such lien, such lien on personal property may be foreclosed in the same manner as provided by law for the foreclosure of mortgages on personal property; and such a lien on real property may be foreclosed in the same manner as provided by law for the foreclosure of mortgages on real property. The foregoing remedy shall be in addition, or as an alternative, to the remedy provided by section 1329 of this title, for the collection of unpaid contributions.

        Provision of subsection (d) of this section that a teacher with a contract or reasonable assurance that he would perform services during the coming school year could not be paid unemployment compensation between school years had a rational relation to a legitimate governmental interest and thus would not be held to discriminate against teacher and deny him equal protection where teacher failed to demonstrate that the class to which he belonged was protected or that the provision impinged on a fundamental interest.

        Whether a claimant was discharged may have an impact on whether he may be disqualified from unemployment benefits by operation of section 1344 of this title, but it can have no impact on whether a claimant is eligible initially to receive benefits under this section.

        Availability for work as prescribed by subdivision (a)(3) of this section is a factual question which must be decided on a case by case basis. Stoodley v. Department of Employment Security, 141 Vt. 457, 449 A.2d 980 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Question of availability for work in relation to eligibility for unemployment compensation benefits lends itself to resolution solely on a case by case basis, and only when facts peculiar to claim under review deny the existence of reasonable availability may benefits be refused. Carson v. Department of Employment Security, 135 Vt. 312, 376 A.2d 355 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether a partially unemployed claimant is available for work in any given week in which part-time work is to be had must necessarily turn on the facts of each case. Jenkins v. Department of Employment Security, 135 Vt. 210, 373 A.2d 533 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Before a partially unemployed claimant may be found to be unavailable in any week in which a portion of the proffered part-time work is missed, it must be first determined that the absence was so unreasonable as to render claimant not reasonably available for employment; under this standard, claimant is either unavailable and disqualified, or is eligible for the benefits provided for in section 1339 of this title.

        Finding that unemployed store clerk was employed on a part-time basis as a postal clerk on Saturday mornings did not demonstrate that she had substantially removed herself from the labor market as a result of her commitment to her part-time job even if it could be said that store clerks generally work on a six day a week basis, since it was difficult to discern how three hours spent on Saturday mornings significantly impaired her availability for other employment for which she was qualified. Carson v. Department of Employment Security, 135 Vt. 312, 376 A.2d 355 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        To qualify for Vermont unemployment compensation an applicant must be available for work in a labor market of sufficiently large geographical area as to provide or encompass employers who use the type of services offered by that applicant. In re Barcomb, 132 Vt. 225, 315 A.2d 476 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Degree of specialization in the services offered to prospective employers by applicant for unemployment compensation affects the geographical size of applicant's labor market for purposes of requirement of subdivision (a)(3) that he be available for work to be eligible for benefits. In re Barcomb, 132 Vt. 225, 315 A.2d 476 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Type of work sought and proximity for demand for those services is far more important in defining labor market when considering application for unemployment compensation than presence or absence of automobile transportation, without more, and no strict rule can be laid down that an automobile is or is not required in order to be "available for work." In re Barcomb, 132 Vt. 225, 315 A.2d 476 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Person of highly specialized skills must be willing to travel further than persons having more generally usable skills and to accede to labor market of sufficient geographical area to include employers utilizing those specialized skills before failure to secure employment might lead to denial of unemployment compensation benefits under subdivision (a)(3) of this section. In re Barcomb, 132 Vt. 225, 315 A.2d 476 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Person holding himself out as available for any "light work" may restrict labor market to his home town if he shows that "light work" is required by employers there. In re Barcomb, 132 Vt. 225, 315 A.2d 476 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Employment Security Board's conclusions that unemployment compensation claimant was not available for work could not stand, and denial of compensation would be reversed, where claimant contacted seven employers within two miles of his home over 30 times, lived in an urban area of 8,000 to 10,000 people, a labor market thus existed within walking distance of his home and there was no evidence that he had materially limited his attachment to an existing labor market by failing to use public transportation. In re Dunn, 131 Vt. 261, 305 A.2d 602 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Issue of availability for work is to be examined in terms of claimant's attachment to labor market, rather than in terms of quantitative measure of his disability. Willard v. Vermont Unemployment Compensation Commission, 122 Vt. 398, 173 A.2d 843 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Burden of establishing attachment to a labor market is on one who has accepted a pension which is designed to pay compensation in lieu of employment, whether conditioned on age or infirmity. Willard v. Vermont Unemployment Compensation Commission, 122 Vt. 398, 173 A.2d 843 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Incapacitating illness and subsequent disability of a claimant for unemployment compensation adds to his burden of establishing his reattachment to the labor market and the fact that a claimant terminated his employment for a reason recognized as good cause does not in itself entitle him to benefits. Willard v. Vermont Unemployment Compensation Commission, 122 Vt. 398, 173 A.2d 843 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Act of taking a pension is only inferentially indicative of withdrawal from the labor market and, as an inference, is subject to being overborne by other proofs showing that a claimant has in fact a genuine attachment to the market. Willard v. Vermont Unemployment Compensation Commission, 122 Vt. 398, 173 A.2d 843 (1961).

        Unreasonable restrictions placed on availability will render a claimant for unemployment compensation benefits unavailable for work. Donahue v. Department of Employment Security, 142 Vt. 351, 454 A.2d 1244 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Shortness of duration of an individual's unemployment, existence of a definite date of recall, or existence of a continuing attachment to a specific employer are not factors prescribed by subdivision (a)(3) of this section as disqualifying an individual from receipt of unemployment benefits on the basis of unavailability for work, and the rule of liberal and broad construction in favor of the distressed workers prohibits imposition of such a disqualification by judicial decision. Donahue v. Department of Employment Security, 142 Vt. 351, 454 A.2d 1244 (1982).

        The purposes of this chapter do not include the right to compensation because personal considerations make acceptance of a suitable job offer inconvenient or difficult, or require an adjustment in the claimant's personal situation that he or she is individually unwilling to make; in such circumstances it is for the Employment Security Board to measure the justification for refusal against the test for availability set forth in this section. Hunt v. Department of Employment Security, 142 Vt. 90, 453 A.2d 391 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Availability, within unemployment compensation requirement that one must be available for and able to work to receive benefits, must be realistic, and it cannot be so circumscribed that one refuses work which meets the statutory measure of suitability of work offered. Martin v. Department of Employment Security, 138 Vt. 475, 417 A.2d 932 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unemployment compensation claimant with a long history of part-time work, who established the existence of a meaningful part-time labor market in her area, could not be denied benefits on the ground that she limited herself and her search for work to part-time work and thus was unavailable for work. Stryker v. Department of Employment Security, 134 Vt. 224, 356 A.2d 534 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Applicants for unemployment compensation cannot condition availability for work on domestic problems such as lack of transportation to work, at least where there are in fact no jobs which could meet those conditions. In re Barcomb, 132 Vt. 225, 315 A.2d 476 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that claimant for unemployment compensation benefits had problems with transportation, babysitting and her husband's desire that she not work at night was not good cause for her to limit her availability for the work suitable for her, factory work, to the first shift, and she was properly denied benefits. In re Prouty, 131 Vt. 504, 310 A.2d 12 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unemployment compensation claimant cannot claim availability for work and at the same time make his availability improperly conditional. In re Platt, 130 Vt. 329, 292 A.2d 822 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        An unemployment compensation claimant may place some restrictions on the type of work he will accept, and he need not accept work entirely foreign to his ability, training and experience, but compensation will be denied where the restrictions are undue or so conditional as to rebut the existence of availability. In re Platt, 130 Vt. 329, 292 A.2d 822 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Conditions and limitations which a claimant for unemployment compensation imposes upon his employment, whether voluntary or involuntary, may render him unavailable for work and bar his recovery of unemployment benefits. Willard v. Vermont Unemployment Compensation Commission, 122 Vt. 398, 173 A.2d 843 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        A willingness to be employed conditionally does not necessarily meet the test of availability. Willard v. Vermont Unemployment Compensation Commission, 122 Vt. 398, 173 A.2d 843 (1961).

        Suitable work, within the requirements of subdivision (a)(3) of this section and section 1344(a)(2)(c) of this title that one must be available for and able to work to receive benefits, is that which an employee is capable of performing and is reasonably related to his qualifications.

        Claimant for unemployment benefits bears the burden of establishing her ability to work and availability for suitable employment, preconditions to eligibility for benefits under subdivision (a)(3) of this section.

       </p>
       <p>
        Ordinarily, a claimant for unemployment benefits can make a prima facie showing of availability for work, a precondition to eligibility for benefits under subdivision (a)(3) of this section, by registering at an employment office and providing the department with evidence of compliance with such other efforts to secure suitable work as the commissioner may reasonably direct. Stoodley v. Department of Employment Security, 141 Vt. 457, 449 A.2d 980 (1982).

       </p>
       <p>
        Ordinarily, availability for work is prima facie established by a showing of proper registration with the Unemployment Compensation Commission, but a claimant who so limits his availability as to be tantamount to a refusal to accept suitable work has the burden of showing good cause for such a refusal. In re Prouty, 131 Vt. 504, 310 A.2d 12 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unemployment compensation claimant made a showing that a labor market for the light work he was able to do existed in the geographical area where he sought employment, and the Employment Security Board should have so found on appeal from referee's decision affirming claims examiner's denial of claim, where claimant showed he lived in an urban community of 8,000 to 10,000, sought employment within walking distance of his home, contacted seven employers over 30 times and stated he had sought over five types of positions.

       <p>
        Employment Security Board did not err in finding that the claimant, an adjunct professor, had a reasonable assurance of employment for the next regularly scheduled academic term when it found that the claimant's employment was subject to one contingency, class size or low enrollment, that this contingency was not within the college's discretion, and that given the fact that all three of the claimant's courses had been filled for the four consecutive semesters he taught, it was highly probable that all three courses would fill the following term. Beasley v. Dep't of Labor Champlain College, 208 Vt. 433, 199 A.3d 553 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where on the last day of the school year teacher involved in labor dispute signed a contract to teach at another school the following September; Employment Security Board's conclusions that subdivision (c)(1) of this section, denying teacher benefits between academic terms, applied, and that the fact that a labor dispute was in progress was 'totally irrelevant' in the absence of authority supporting teacher's claim that the labor dispute made subdivision (c)(1) inapplicable, were not erroneous. Delneo v. Department of Employment & Training, 148 Vt. 388, 533 A.2d 1190 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Teacher's aids, who devoted over one-half of their time at work to working directly with students in the administration and correction of tests, tutoring of students in mathematics, reading and other subjects, and using films, tapes and work books, and, in addition, participated in preparation of student evaluations and conducted conferences between parents, students and teachers, were performing services in the role of teachers and were therefore excluded from receipt of unemployment compensation benefits during period between academic years by provision of this section excluding persons serving in an instructional capacity for an educational institution with a reasonable assurance that they will perform a similar service for the same educational institution in the next academic year. Riddel v. Department of Employment Security, 140 Vt. 82, 436 A.2d 1086 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Payment of teachers' aides, who operated in the role of teachers, on an hourly basis rather than upon a salary basis, as teachers were paid, did not have effect of exempting aides from operation of provision of this section excluding from receipt of unemployment compensation benefits during period between academic years of persons serving in an instructional capacity for an educational institution with a reasonable assurance that they will perform similar service for the same educational institution in the next academic year, under which provision teachers were excluded from benefits.

       <p>
        Teacher who in June received verbal assurance that he would be offered his position for the next academic year and received a written confirmation of the assurance was properly denied unemployment compensation under this section's provision that compensation not be paid between school years if the teacher had a contract or a reasonable assurance that he would perform services in the coming year; and a written contract was not necessary.

       Subsection (b) of this section was amended and repealed by Act No. 64 of the 1977 Session.
    Section 25(b) of the Act repealed subsec. (b) without apparent consideration of the fact that section 19 had amended subdiv. (b)(1).
    Since section 25(d) of the Act provided that both sections 19 and 25(b) would take effect July 1, 1977, legislative intent as to subsec. (b) is unclear.

        Under provision of this section disqualifying an individual for unemployment compensation benefits when he has been discharged by his last employing unit for misconduct connected with his work, if so found by the Commissioner, it is the Commissioner who is delegated the duty to determine whether the employee was discharged for misconduct, so that Supreme Court on review can overturn the result only when the established facts do not support the result reached, or compel a different result as a matter of law.

        That an employee's conduct constitutes misconduct which is grounds for being discharged from employment does not necessarily make the conduct misconduct for purposes of this section disqualifying one for unemployment compensation when one is discharged for misconduct connected with work; the employer's determination may be evidence, but is not per se controlling, and the Commissioner must make a separate determination in light of the remedial and beneficial purposes of this section, not on the basis of employer's policies.

       </p>
       <p>
        On appeal from disqualification from benefits on ground that claimant's misrepresentation of qualifications during an employment interview constituted substantial disregard of employer's business interests where evidence indicated information concerning the nature of previous employment given by claimant during interview was accurate, that employer did not inquire further as to her qualifications or check references, and that the employer subsequently felt that she misrepresented her work history at the time she was interviewed and became dissatisfied with her performance as a result, findings did not support conclusion of Employment Security Board that the claimant misrepresented the nature of her previous employment and conclusion was an error as a matter of law. Genier v. Department of Employment Security, 140 Vt. 453, 438 A.2d 1116 (1981).

       </h5>
       <p>
        To be disqualified from benefits under subdivision (a)(1)(A) of this section, employee's misconduct must be in substantial disregard of employers' interest, his disregard being either willful or culpably negligent, and culpable negligence must involve more than mere mistakes, errors in judgment, unintentional carelessness or negligence. Favreau v. Department of Employment & Training, 151 Vt. 170, 557 A.2d 909 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that misconduct may support a discharge does not necessarily mean that the same misconduct disqualifies an employee from receiving unemployment benefits. Cross v. Department of Employment & Training, 147 Vt. 634, 523 A.2d 1247 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether an employee's conduct constituted misconduct connected with his work, amounting to a substantial disregard of the employer's interest, either willful or culpably negligent, a separate evaluation in the light of the remedial and beneficial purposes of this chapter must be conducted. Cross v. Department of Employment & Training, 147 Vt. 634, 523 A.2d 1247 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        For an employee's misconduct to disqualify him for unemployment compensation benefits there must be evidence of substantial willful or culpably negligent disregard of the employer's interest. Strong v. Department of Employment & Training, 144 Vt. 128, 473 A.2d 1170 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Misconduct that is sufficient for discharge is not necessarily sufficient to require disqualification for benefits under this section. Johnson v. Department of Employment Security, 138 Vt. 554, 420 A.2d 106 (1980); Schaffner v. Department of Employment Security, 140 Vt. 89, 436 A.2d 743 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        The term "misconduct" in subdivision (a)(1) of this section means an act or course of conduct in violation of the employee's duties, which is tantamount to an intentional disregard of the employer's interests. Schaffner v. Department of Employment Security, 140 Vt. 89, 436 A.2d 743 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        A key factor when determining whether a discharged employee should be disqualified from receiving unemployment benefits because of a discharge for misconduct is that the conduct be tantamount to an intentional disregard of the employer's interests. Schaffner v. Department of Employment Security, 140 Vt. 89, 436 A.2d 743 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Employee's work-related misconduct which will disqualify him from unemployment compensation involves substantial disregard of employer's interest, either willful or culpably negligent, an act or course of conduct violating his duties and tantamount to intentional disregard of employer's interest; mere mistakes, errors on judgment, unintentional carelessness, or negligence is not enough, though it may warrant discharge. Porter v. Department of Employment Security, 139 Vt. 405, 430 A.2d 450 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Misconduct on job from which unemployment compensation claimant is dismissed justifies denial of benefits for a certain period if misconduct involves substantial disregard of employer's interest, either willful or culpably negligent. In re Therrien, 132 Vt. 535, 325 A.2d 357 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is for the Commissioner to find whether or not the actions leading to discharge mount to misconduct connected with employee's work. In re Gray, 127 Vt. 303, 248 A.2d 693 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Employer's determination that as to that employer, the conduct is considered misconduct, may be evidence relevant to the issue before the Commissioner, but is not per se controlling. In re Gray, 127 Vt. 303, 248 A.2d 693 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial disregard of employer's interest, either willful or culpably negligent, is the kind of conduct that disqualifies discharged employee from unemployment benefits. In re Gray, 127 Vt. 303, 248 A.2d 693 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether employee's actions leading to discharge amount to misconduct connected with his work, Commissioner must conduct a separate valuation in the light of the remedial and beneficial purposes of this chapter, rather than on the basis of internal hiring procedures adopted by employer's. In re Gray, 127 Vt. 303, 248 A.2d 693 (1968).

       </p>
       <p>
        At hearing on disqualification for unemployment benefits due to misconduct connected with work, employer has burden of proof on issue of misconduct, and measure of proof is civil standard of preponderance of the evidence, not criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt.

       </p>

        The burden of proving that particular misconduct disqualifies an employee from receiving benefits is squarely on the employer. Cross v. Department of Employment & Training, 147 Vt. 634, 523 A.2d 1247 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        When misconduct is asserted as the basis for an employee's discharge and resultant disqualification for unemployment compensation benefits, the burden of proof is on the employer. Porter v. Department of Employment & Training, 144 Vt. 128, 473 A.2d 1170 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>

       </p>
       <p>
        Burden of proof rests squarely on employer to show work-related misconduct as a ground for denying unemployment compensation benefits to a dismissed employee and employer must show disregard of its interests, either willful or culpably negligent. Johnson v. Department of Employment Security, 138 Vt. 554, 420 A.2d 106 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        An employer claiming employee was discharged for misconduct connected with his work and thus should be denied unemployment compensation benefits has burden of proof on the issue. Cooley v. Department of Employment Security, 138 Vt. 211, 414 A.2d 1154 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>

        Plain language of the new full disqualification provision of the Unemployment Compensation Act still requires that misconduct be connected with the employee's work, and nothing in its language suggests that the Legislature intended to overrule

       </p>
       <p>
        Question of whether a claimant who was dismissed for off-duty, off-premises, and work-unrelated criminal conduct should have been disqualified from unemployment compensation benefits was different from the question of whether his employer adopted an appropriate employment policy. Misconduct that is sufficient for discharge is not necessarily sufficient to require a disqualification from benefits under the Unemployment Compensation Act. Mohamed v. Fletcher Allen Heath Care, 192 Vt. 204, 58 A.3d 222 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme Court would not read into this section a disqualified for misconduct unconnected with employment, so as to disqualify appellant, whose employment was terminated upon incarceration for an offense occurring prior to employment, particularly in light of legislature's 1974 amendment of statute to eliminate as a ground of disqualification an employee's conviction of a felony committed after the time of his last previous employment. Chamberlin v. Department of Employment Security, 136 Vt. 571, 396 A.2d 140 (1978).

        Where employee was charged with driving while intoxicated after being hired as a driver but before beginning work, and was convicted and lost his license almost two years later, and employer forced him to sign resignation by threatening to withhold his vacation pay until he signed, employee did not leave his employer voluntarily without good cause attributable to his employer by voluntarily entering into conduct which resulted in losing his license and could not be denied unemployment compensation on that ground.

       <p>
        Decision of Employment Security Board awarding unemployment compensation benefits to claimant was supported by substantial evidence and was without error where the board found that the claimant resigned because of lack of training which had been promised him when he was first hired and had given notice for that reason that, although the claimant's dissatisfaction with safety at the work place was not itself good reason to quit under subdivision (a)(2)(A) of this section, that fact did not purge the independent basis of lack of training as reason to quit, and that the employer's contention that it was not given adequate opportunity to implement the promised training was rebutted by its failure to provide such training for approximately one and one-half years despite its contrary promise.

It found that the proximate cause of her decision to quit was not a unilateral cut in pay eight weeks previously, but an exchange of text messages regarding the employer's insistence that the claimant attend training without pay; moreover, the record supported the ruling that it was unreasonable for the claimant to refuse to meet with the employer about the unpaid training unless a third party was present.

        It was an error to find that an unemployment insurance claimant who quit her job after being told by the employer's president that the payroll checks she had prepared would bounce had quit without good cause. The claimant's specialized knowledge about her employer's grim financial situation and the statement from the president of the company about not receiving a paycheck lent strong support to the reasonableness of her belief that she would not be paid; furthermore, although the checks did clear, this fact did not render the claimant's belief at the time of the quit unreasonable.

        Suitable work, within the requirements of subdivision (a)(2)(C) of this section and section 1343(a)(3) of this title, that one must be available for and able to work to receive benefits, is that which an employee is capable of performing and is reasonably related to his qualifications. Gutches v. Department of Employment Security, 141 Vt. 587, 450 A.2d 1146 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutory definition of suitable work does not become different because the job offer comes from a former employer. A particular job does not necessarily become suitable because the claimant was in the position to accept comparable conditions and restrictions in the past. Piper v. Dep't of Labor, 189 Vt. 417, 22 A.3d 438 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining suitability of available jobs, the Employment Security Board must see that the job is reasonably related to claimant's qualifications, and courts generally have recognized claimant's right to reject, without loss of benefits, a job which involves far less skill than he possesses. In re Potvin, 132 Vt. 14, 313 A.2d 25 (1973).

       <p>
        Where the Legislature meant "good cause" to be attributable to the employer in subdivision (a)(2)(A) of this section, it plainly said so; where it did not say so in subdivision (a)(2)(C), it intended no such restriction; overruling
        Nurmi v. Vermont Employment Security Board

       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether good cause exists for refusal to accept suitable work when offered, each case must be decided on its own facts, and the criterion to be followed in making such decision is one of reasonableness, that is, what a reasonable person would be expected to do in the same circumstances. Shufelt v. Department of Employment & Training, 148 Vt. 163, 531 A.2d 894 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        For purposes of determining disqualification for unemployment compensation, reasonableness, or what a reasonable person would be expected to do in the same circumstances, is the criterion for "good cause" in refusing a work referral or offer of employment; hours of work may be as significant a factor as distance of travel, and pay scale is also significant. Palucci v. Department of Employment Security, 135 Vt. 156, 376 A.2d 14 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Claimant could not be disqualified under subdivision (a)(2)(C) of this section for refusing a referral when position was filled at time of claimant's refusal. Dubuque v. Department of Employment Security, 135 Vt. 458, 380 A.2d 79 (1977).

        Where unemployment compensation claimant was asked job which would involve a change from semi-skilled to unskilled level and result in a 40% reduction in her wages, claimant's refusal was justified and for good cause. In re Potvin, 132 Vt. 14, 313 A.2d 25 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        The meaning of the words "good cause," as used in the provision of this section, disqualifying individuals from claiming benefits where they fail to apply for or accept work or employment without good cause, must be determined in each case from the facts of that case. Nurmi v. Vermont Employment Security Board, 124 Vt. 42, 197 A.2d 483 (1963), overruled on other grounds, Shufelt v. Department of Employment & Training (1987) 148 Vt. 163, 531 A.2d 894.

        To be entitled to unemployment compensation, unemployed persons declining work must do so for good cause connected with the work itself rather than on account of personal inconvenience or home problems.

       </h5>
       <p>
        A showing of good cause is the first stage a claimant who refuses to accept suitable work when offered must pass in order to demonstrate eligibility; if the Department determines that claimant has shown good cause, it must then determine whether restrictions, even with good cause, substantially impair claimant's attachment to the labor market. Shufelt v. Department of Employment & Training, 148 Vt. 163, 531 A.2d 894 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although a cause that justifies an employee in leaving employment, or in refusing offered employment, will also, in most instances, prevent him from meeting test of availability for work and thus disqualify him from receiving benefits, is such a claimant is able and available to do suitable work in spite of his disability, he may still be entitled to benefits. Willard v. Vermont Unemployment Compensation Commission, 122 Vt. 398, 173 A.2d 843 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Limitations placed on availability for employment have the effect of circumscribing the labor market to which a claimant for unemployment compensation asserts attachment, and if the imposed conditions are used to justify the refusal of suitable employment, yet have no sound causal basis, recovery of benefits is barred.

        Employment Security Board's conclusion that an offer of a permanent position to a temporary employee at a considerable reduction in salary was not an offer of "suitable work" was a matter within Board's expertise, and would not be overturned on appeal absent a showing of error. Lincoln v. Department of Employment & Training, 156 Vt. 316, 592 A.2d 885 (1991).

       <p>
        When wage is being considered under unemployment compensation rule that one may be disqualified from benefits for refusing suitable work, but need not accept work at substantially lower wages, speculation on prospects of success in a new and untried position and on prospects of having higher wages where wages depend at least partly on production are expectations, not facts, and the issue must be dealt with on basis of existing circumstances as established by the evidence. Martin v. Department of Employment Security, 138 Vt. 475, 417 A.2d 932 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although one may be disqualified from unemployment compensation benefits for refusing suitable work, one need not accept work at substantially less skill or pay levels, and where there was a substantially lower wage offered for a job with less skill and the offer came within a very short time of applicant's layoff, there could be no disqualification for refusing the position. Martin v. Department of Employment Security, 138 Vt. 475, 417 A.2d 932 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        "Suitable" work requirement does not require that job offer must be for wages equal to that of old work, but statute is designed to preserve, as much as possible, claimant's present economic status and standard of living. In re Potvin, 132 Vt. 14, 313 A.2d 25 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        A claimant's refusal of a job, absent other circumstances, will be held unjustified where the proffered wages are not significantly less than former wages; but refusal of a job which offers a substantial reduction in pay will often be held justified, and benefits in the latter case may not be discontinued.

        In finding that a claimant for unemployment benefits had rejected suitable work as an electrical helper on a job site in Albany, New York, about five hours from the claimant's home, the Employment Security Board erred by finding a larger labor market area than the evidence supported. No evidence supported the Board's finding that the work that the claimant was qualified to perform required lengthy travel distances, and the administrative law judge, whose findings the Board had adopted, had made a labor market area finding directly to the contrary, at least with respect to a travel distance as far as Albany.

        In determining disqualification for unemployment compensation under provision of this section relating to disqualification for failure to apply for available, suitable work, occupation of waitress is not so highly specialized as to come automatically within rule that a person of highly specialized skills must be willing to travel greater distances to find available, suitable work and accede to a labor market of sufficient geographical area to include employers utilizing those specialized skills.

        For purposes of determining disqualification for unemployment compensation, conclusion of Employment Security Board that claimant who had no transportation of her own must supply it to reach a job seven miles from her home was completely unsupportable since it could not reasonably be said that one drawing $27.00 per week unemployment benefits must move, buy a car, or hire a cab to reach a job outside the area, seven miles distant, paying $1.50 per hour plus tips for work as a breakfast waitress.

Furthermore, the claimant's application for Social Security Disability Insurance benefits was a relevant, but not dispositive, factor in assessing his eligibility for unemployment compensation.

        Where claimant for unemployment compensation benefits signed a contract to work as a mental health aide for a counseling service and following an accident which was unrelated to her work claimant notified the counseling service that a broken kneecap suffered in the accident prevented her from continuing to carry out her duties as a mental health aide, the Employment Security Board did not err in its determination that claimant terminated her employment for nonemployment-related health reasons.

         120. History.
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The labor dispute disqualification provision of subdivision (a)(4) of this section was patterned after a provision in the federal Social Security Draft Bill for unemployment compensation prepared by the Committee on Economic Security in 1936, as were labor dispute disqualification provisions of similar statutes in 33 other states. Trapeni v. Department of Employment Security, 142 Vt. 317, 455 A.2d 329 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        <b>
         121. Stoppage of work.
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The question of whether there has been a substantial curtailment of employer's operations and, therefore, a "stoppage of work" within the meaning of this section depends on the facts and circumstances of each case. Pfenning v. Department of Employment & Training, 151 Vt. 50, 557 A.2d 897 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        The phrase "stoppage of work" in subdivision (a)(4) of this section refers to the effect upon the employer's operations rather than the cessation of work by the employees. Pfenning v. Department of Employment & Training, 147 Vt. 533, 522 A.2d 743 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Factors proper for consideration in resolving the question of whether there has been a stoppage of work within the meaning of subdivision (a)(4) of this section include a comparison of business revenues, production or services, and worker hours before and during the strike. Pfenning v. Department of Employment & Training, 147 Vt. 533, 522 A.2d 743 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        The phrase "stoppage of work" in subdivision (a)(4) of this section refers to a curtailment of the employer's operations first, since 22 of the 23 states with similar statutes and that have interpreted the phrase have held that the phrase refers not to work of the claimant employees but to the operations of the employer; further, where the legislature had an opportunity in 1982 to totally eliminate the possibility of a striking employee qualifying for unemployment benefits by deleting the phrase "stoppage of work" but chose not to act, and thus expressed its intent to leave the labor dispute disqualifications intact and to adopt the administrative construction given to the statute; and finally, since only by construing "stoppage of work" to refer to the curtailment of the employer's operations is there given full effect to every word and clause of the provision. Trapeni v. Department of Employment Security, 142 Vt. 317, 455 A.2d 329 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Only by construing "stoppage of work" in subdivision (a)(4) of this section to refer to the curtailment of the employer's operations is there given full effect to every word and clause of that subdivision; where the phrase "stoppage of work" refers to cessation of work on the part of the employee, it would render the phrase "his total or partial unemployment is due to a stoppage of work which exists because of a labor dispute" meaningless since the sentence has already mentioned unemployment - which always involves a stoppage of work by the employee - and presupposes the existence of that condition. Trapeni v. Department of Employment Security, 142 Vt. 317, 455 A.2d 329 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Employment Security Board properly ruled that the labor dispute disqualification provision of subdivision (a)(4) of this section did not disqualify the claimants for benefits where there was no substantial curtailment of the employer's operations as a result of the strike since the phrase "stoppage of work" in the subdivision refers to a curtailment of the employer's operations. Trapeni v. Department of Employment Security, 142 Vt. 317, 455 A.2d 329 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where Employment Security Board did not find a "stoppage of work," necessary to the labor dispute disqualification from unemployment compensation, Supreme Court could not supply the missing facts by examination of the transcript, but findings that there was a labor dispute and a picket line sufficiently supported conclusion there was a stoppage of work. LaFountain v. Vermont Employment Security Board, 133 Vt. 42, 330 A.2d 468 (1974).

        <b>
         122. Lockout.
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        The plain meaning of the term "labor dispute" in subdivision (a)(4) of this section is broad enough to encompass a lockout. Pfenning v. Department of Employment & Training, 147 Vt. 533, 522 A.2d 743 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        The phrase "lockout or other dispute" in subdivision (a)(2)(E)(i) of this section indicates legislative intent to include lockout in the term "dispute" in subdivision (a)(4). Pfenning v. Department of Employment & Training, 147 Vt. 533, 522 A.2d 743 (1986).

         123. Effect on employer's operations.
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        In deciding employees' claim for benefits during lockout by employer, Employment Security Board's use of number of machining operations as a method of measuring degree of curtailment of employer's operations was plausible. Pfenning v. Department of Employment & Training, 151 Vt. 50, 557 A.2d 897 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Both striking and locked out employees can receive unemployment compensation benefits if the employer's operations are not substantially curtailed. Pfenning v. Department of Employment & Training, 147 Vt. 533, 522 A.2d 743 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the employer is unaffected by employees' use of economic weapon of a strike, then the unemployed strikers should be treated no differently than any other unemployed workers. Whitcomb v. Department of Employment & Training, 147 Vt. 525, 520 A.2d 602 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        A significant effect on the employer's operations is a prerequisite to denying compensation benefits where unemployment is due to a labor dispute. Whitcomb v. Department of Employment & Training, 147 Vt. 525, 520 A.2d 602 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial curtailment of employer's operations, required to deny strikers unemployment benefits, means more than any deviation from normal operations. Whitcomb v. Department of Employment & Training, 147 Vt. 525, 520 A.2d 602 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        The determination of substantial curtailment of employer's operations, required to deny strikers unemployment compensation benefits, must depend upon facts and circumstances of each case, but among the factors commonly considered are business revenues, production, services and worker hours before and during the strike. Whitcomb v. Department of Employment & Training, 147 Vt. 525, 520 A.2d 602 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Employment Security Board's conclusion that there had been substantial curtailment of operations of telephone company, supporting its denial of unemployment compensation benefits to striking employees, was justified where there had been significant curtailment of certain functions, a decrease in worker hours, a substantial increase in backlogs of installation orders and significant delays in calls requiring operator assistance. Whitcomb v. Department of Employment & Training, 147 Vt. 525, 520 A.2d 602 (1986).

       </p>
       <p>
        "Last employed," within disqualification from unemployment benefits of person unemployed due to labor dispute where he was "last employed," means last permanently employed with intent to remain, not last in time. In re Hatch, 130 Vt. 248, 290 A.2d 180 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        With respect to disqualification from unemployment compensation benefits of those out of work due to a labor dispute, who have not severed their employment, other employment during the dispute does not by itself sever the relation with the employer involved in the labor dispute. LaFountain v. Vermont Employment Security Board, 133 Vt. 42, 330 A.2d 468 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where employee refused to cross picket line resulting from a labor dispute between his union and his employer, did not notify employer that he intended to terminate his employment, said he couldn't go to work when, about four months later, employer offered him work, and after the strike began worked for one company on three occasions, for a day twice and for three and a half weeks once, and also worked for two other companies, once for three days and the other time for a week and a half, Employment Security Board properly denied him unemployment compensation benefits on the ground he was last employed with the struck employer, did not sever his employment and thus was not entitled to benefits under labor dispute disqualification. LaFountain v. Vermont Employment Security Board, 133 Vt. 42, 330 A.2d 468 (1974).

       </p>
       <p>
        Labor dispute disqualification from unemployment compensation is purged by taking another job only where that job is intended to be permanent, to completely replace and terminate the former employment, and to sever completely the relationship with the former employer. In re Hatch, 130 Vt. 248, 290 A.2d 180 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where unemployment compensation claimant stated that he did not know whether he would have left job, taken after former employment was interrupted by labor dispute, and returned to former employment, and that he was awful tempted to stay at new job, and where he signed up with former employer, after work stoppage, to have his company life insurance kept in force, and admitted that he had never severed relationship with former employer, he had not purged himself of labor dispute disqualification by taking another job, as such job was not permanent and did not sever completely the former employment. In re Hatch, 130 Vt. 248, 290 A.2d 180 (1972).

       <p>
        Employee out of work during a labor dispute, who seeks to avoid unemployment compensation disqualification of such persons who have not severed their employment, has burden of proving that other work during the dispute was not a stop-gap measure which employee intended to drop should the dispute end, and of proving a bona fide severance of employment with the employer involved in the dispute. LaFountain v. Vermont Employment Security Board, 133 Vt. 42, 330 A.2d 468 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Burden of proof is on unemployment compensation claimant to show that his employment with a different employer following work stoppage due to labor dispute purged him of labor dispute disqualification from benefits. In re Hatch, 130 Vt. 248, 290 A.2d 180 (1972).

       </p>
       <p>
        Employer's payment of accrued vacation pay to an unemployment benefits claimant was not equivalent to paying her wages for the remainder of the notice period and thus did not render her separation voluntary. Kelley v. Dep't of Labor, 197 Vt. 155, 101 A.3d 895 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where Board, pursuant to this section, denied unemployment compensation claim on basis that claimant received vacation pay exceeding benefits to which he may have been otherwise entitled, and Board's computation was reached by allocating vacation pay received from two former employers in 1973, as well as amount received from current employer in 1974, and applying total to period of customary industry vacation shutdown in July, 1974, allocation could not stand as there was no basis in record for Board's allocation of 1973 payments to the 1974 vacation period; vacation pay received should have been allocated to period immediately following termination of employment. Griffith v. Department of Employment Security, 135 Vt. 331, 376 A.2d 758 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Employee who is laid off prior to June 1, but receives vacation pay for which he is eligible subsequent to June 1, is disqualified from receiving benefits during the period for which he receives vacation pay. 1948-50 Op. Atty. Gen. 237.

        Where at a time of his application for unemployment compensation benefits plaintiff was receiving a monthly pension, fifty percent of which was contributed to him during the course of his former employment, his benefit amount was properly reduced by the prorated weekly amount of his pension after the deduction of the percentage of his contribution as required by the unambiguous language of subdivision (a)(5)(E)(i) of this section, notwithstanding the fact that under the tax laws pension payments he received for the first three years after retirement would be considered as consisting entirely of his contributions.

        Because subsection (b) of this section requires full reimbursement, claimant was required to repay to the Department of Employment and Training unemployment compensation benefits received for the time period that overlapped with the period for which he or she later received workers' compensation benefits. Deductions cannot be made under the common fund doctrine, even for equitable considerations. Butson v. Department of Employment and Training, 179 Vt. 599, 892 A.2d 255 (mem.) (January 12, 2006).

       <p>
        Unpaid salary awarded to wife as part of a contempt sanction under a temporary order entered in a divorce action did not have to be reduced by the amount of unemployment compensation wife received during the period in question. Whether wife was required to repay the unemployment compensation she received following the court's award was a matter between her and the Department of Employment and Training. Tracey v. Gaboriault, 166 Vt. 269, 691 A.2d 1056 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although unemployment compensation claimants who had quit work because they thought the building they were working on as carpenters was unsafe initially did not advise the unemployment compensation office as to why they quit, where they gave a full account of the matter when interviewed by a claim representative they could not be required to repay benefits on ground of nondisclosure or misrepresentation of a material fact. Call v. Department of Employment Security, 138 Vt. 52, 411 A.2d 1336 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Recipient of unemployment compensation benefits was not liable to repay benefits where record contained no evidence of nondisclosure or misrepresentation. In re Potvin, 132 Vt. 14, 313 A.2d 25 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, in interview, unemployment compensation claims examiner found that claimant who had been receiving benefits did not fulfill the conditions of receiving benefits in that she limited the factory work she sought and was suitable for to the first shift only, for domestic reasons, claimant was not liable for repayment of benefits received during the first week that she was found disqualified, because it was not shown that nondisclosure or misrepresentation on her part led to receipt of the benefits.

        Town employer failed in its contention that this section required only that the Department of Employment and Training make a prompt decision on each claim, and not that it actually disburse disputed funds once the claimant receives a favorable decision because, under federal and State law, the department was both authorized and required to disburse the funds to a former employee after the Employment Security Board found them payable.

        Under this section's provision that notice of initial unemployment compensation claim determination be sent to claimant, the employer, interested parties and the Commissioner, employer's attorney was not an interested party and was not entitled to notice separate from notice sent employer; where employer, but not its attorney, was sent notice and employer did not appeal within 10-day time for appeal, appeal was properly dismissed as untimely, and the fact that employer's attorney appealed four days after attorney received notice of initial determination did not save appeal.

        Claimant received "prompt notice" within meaning of subdivision (a) of this section, despite five-day delay between issuance and receipt of decision, where notice he received allowed him a reasonable amount of time to preserve his appeal and occurred by an acceptable method of delivery.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Within 30 days after date thereof, an interested party may appeal from the decision of the referee to the Board, by filing a written request therefor in the manner prescribed by regulations of the Board.
    The appeal shall be heard by the Board after notice to the claimant and his or her last employer, within a reasonable time after notice of the appeal is filed, and the Board may affirm, modify, or reverse the decision of the referee solely on the basis of evidence in the record transferred to it by the referee, or upon the basis of evidence in the record and such additional evidence as it may direct to be taken.
    Upon motion made by the Commissioner, a review may be initiated by the Board of a decision of the referee or a benefit determination.
    The Board shall make its findings of fact and conclusions thereon.
    Prompt notice of the findings of fact, ruling of law, conclusions, and decision of the Board shall be given as hereinabove provided.
    The decision shall be final unless an appeal to the Supreme Court is taken.
    Testimony given at any hearing upon a disputed claim shall be recorded, but the record need not be transcribed unless ordered.

        Employment Security Board's rule that appeals be heard upon the evidence in the record made before referee and that the Board may direct a referee to take additional evidence did not limit the Board to a determination as to whether or not the findings of the referee were supported by the credible evidence and the Board could make its own findings, and it was not improper to provide by rule for the taking of further evidence before a referee rather than before the Board.

       <p>
        Where unemployment compensation claimant claimed on appeal that referee at hearing was not fair and impartial in that he did not advise claimant of right to subpoena employer or of implications of medical issue, and record showed referee properly assisted claimant and inquired into medical issue and as to reason for termination of employment, and claimant failed to show prejudice or to show what additional information or evidence he could add to that put before the referee at the hearing, no error would be found.

        Appeals referee's refusal to grant claimant's request to issue a subpoena to employer's bookkeeper was an abuse of the discretion provided by section 1352 of this title and a failure to conduct the hearing "in such manner as to ascertain the substantial rights of the parties" as required by this section, where hearsay statements of the bookkeeper were introduced into the record at the hearing on the appeal.

        Use of hearsay statements in hearings of the Employment Security Board is acceptable practice, as the referee and the Board are not bound by common law or statutory rules of evidence. Bouchard v. Department of Emp. and Training, 174 Vt. 588, 816 A.2d 508 (mem.) (2002).

        Pursuant to provisions of this section, hearsay evidence is normally admissible in unemployment compensation proceeding. Harrington v. Department of Employment & Training, 152 Vt. 446, 566 A.2d 988 (1989).

         1. Subpoenas.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In an unemployment benefits case, it was error for the administrative law judge not to issue a subpoena for claimant to obtain records. The records, which showed who was working on the dates of drug-tampering incidents that occurred before the one for which claimant was fired, were relevant because the fact finder could have found it likely that the same person was responsible for each incident; thus, the records could be used to show that another person was responsible for the later incident over which claimant was fired. Shaddy v. Department of Labor, 186 Vt. 633, 987 A.2d 311 (mem.) (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not indicate how the Board or referee must use their subpoena power, other than indicating that they have some discretion in deciding when to issue subpoenas. Langlois v. Department of Employment & Training, 149 Vt. 498, 546 A.2d 1365 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Absent extraordinary circumstances, a request for a subpoena made at any time before the close of the initial hearing on a claim should be considered timely, because it is only at the hearing that the full merits of the request can be fully evaluated. Langlois v. Department of Employment & Training, 149 Vt. 498, 546 A.2d 1365 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was a denial of due process of law for unemployment compensation appeals referee to refuse to grant claimant's request to issue a subpoena to employer's bookkeeper, where hearsay statements of the bookkeeper were introduced into the record at the hearing on the appeal. Langlois v. Department of Employment & Training, 149 Vt. 498, 546 A.2d 1365 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appeals referee's refusal to grant claimant's request to issue a subpoena to employer's bookkeeper was an abuse of the discretion provided by this section and a failure to conduct the hearing "in such manner as to ascertain the substantial rights of the parties" as required by section 1351 of this title, where hearsay statements of the bookkeeper were introduced into the record at the hearing on the appeal. Langlois v. Department of Employment & Training, 149 Vt. 498, 546 A.2d 1365 (1988).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Under the statute addressing the collateral import of unemployment compensation claims proceedings, the Employment Security Board's findings and conclusions reached in denying plaintiff's claim for unemployment compensation benefits were inadmissible in, and could not bar, his defamation claim against his employer. Shaddy v. Brattleboro Retreat, 192 Vt. 215, 57 A.3d 700 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        By disbursing all the funds awarded to a former employee, the Employment Security Board deprived a town employer of any financial stake in the outcome of its appeal from the Board's decision because, even if the town were to prevail, the Department of Employment and Training would exercise its authority under 21 V.S.A.
        §
        1321(f) to collect reimbursement from the town for all the benefits "paid but denied on appeal" to the employee, and the town did not need to fear further liability as a result of the Board's decision because of the provision of this section prohibiting the collateral use of
    "[a]ny determination, redetermination, finding of fact, conclusion of law, decision, final order, or final judgment entered or made by . . . the employment security board" in any "separate or subsequent action"; accordingly, the town's appeal was moot for lack of any stake in its outcome. Holton v. Department of Employment and Training, 178 Vt. 147, 878 A.2d 1051 (April 1, 2005).

    In the event that there are insufficient funds in the Contingent Fund as provided in section 1365 of this title, such monies shall be promptly replaced by monies appropriated for such purpose from the general funds of this State to the Unemployment Compensation Administration Fund for expenditure as provided in sections 1362 and 1363 of this title.

     </h3>
     <p>
      There is hereby created a special fund to be known as the Contingent Fund.
    All interest, fines, and penalties collected under the provisions of the unemployment compensation law after April 1, 1947, together with any voluntary contributions tendered as a contribution to this Fund, shall be paid into this Fund.
    Such monies shall not be expended or available for expenditures in any manner which would permit their substitution for, or a corresponding reduction in, federal funds which would in the absence of such monies be available to finance expenditures for the administration of the unemployment compensation law.
    But nothing in this chapter shall prevent such monies from being used as a revolving fund to cover expenditures, necessary and proper under the law for which federal funds have been duly requested but not yet received, subject to the charging of such expenditures against such funds when received.
    The monies in this Fund shall be used by the Commissioner for the payment of costs of administration which are found not to have been properly and validly chargeable against federal grants, or other funds, received for or in the Unemployment Compensation Administration Fund on or after January 1, 1947.
    No expenditure of the Fund shall be made unless and until the Commissioner finds that no other funds are available or can properly be used to finance such expenditures.
    The State Treasurer shall co-sign all expenditures from this Fund authorized by the Commissioner.
    The monies in this Fund are hereby specifically made available to replace, within a reasonable time, any monies received by this State pursuant to section 302 of the federal Social Security Act, as amended, which because of any action or contingency, have been lost or have been expended for purposes other than, or in amounts in excess of, those necessary for the proper administration of the unemployment compensation law.
    The monies in this Fund shall be continuously available to the Commissioner for expenditure in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall not lapse at any time or be transferred to any other fund except as herein provided.
    Provided, however, that on December 31 of each year all monies in excess of $10,000.00 in this Fund shall be transferred to the Unemployment Compensation Fund.
    On or before March 31 of each year, an audit of this Fund will be completed and a report of that audit will be made public. In the event that a refund of interest, a fine, or a penalty is found necessary, and such interest, fine, or penalty has been deposited in the Contingent Fund, such refund shall be made from the Contingent Fund.

Upon receipt of such notice, the agency shall thereafter transfer to the Commissioner any amounts that would otherwise be payable by the agency to the employing unit, up to the amount certified by the Commissioner.

      It is hereby declared to be the legislative judgment that the expediency and beneficial operation of this chapter are dependent upon the effective operation within this State of certain sections of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, and amendments thereto: (1) section 3301 of said Act imposing an excise tax upon employers as defined in said Act; (2) section 3302 allowing against said tax credits for contributions exacted of employers for an unemployment fund whether or not exacted in full of the particular taxpayer under certain circumstances; (3) section 3303 prescribing the conditions upon which said credits may be allowed in addition to actual payments by said taxpayer; (4) sections 3303 and 3304 requiring the certification for the purpose of said credits of state law and prescribing the conditions precedent of such certification.
    If any of said sections shall be repealed, amended, suspended, or finally declared invalid so as to deprive a contributor under this act of credits against the excise tax against him or her under said section 3301 of the Federal Unemployment Tax Act, then any contribution required by this chapter, to the extent that by reason of said repeal, amendment, suspension, or declared invalidity of said federal act, a contributor is deprived of the benefit of such credit, shall be suspended as provided in section 1387 of this title.

      <li id="t21c17sub03s1452ol1a">
       An employer wishing to participate in an STC program shall submit a Department of Labor electronic application or a signed written short-time compensation plan to the Commissioner for approval. The Commissioner may approve an STC plan only if the following criteria are met:
       <ol>
        <li id="t21c17sub03s1452ol1a1">
         The plan identifies the specified affected units to which it applies.
        </li>
        <li id="t21c17sub03s1452ol1a2">
         The employees in the affected unit or units are identified by name, Social Security number, and by any other information required by the Commissioner.
        </li>
        <li id="t21c17sub03s1452ol1a3">
         The plan provides that if the employer provides fringe benefits, including health benefits and retirement benefits under a defined benefit plan or contributions under a defined contribution plan, to any employee whose workweek is reduced under the program, that the benefits will continue to be provided to employees participating in the short-time compensation program under the same terms and conditions as though the workweek had not been reduced. However, reductions in the benefits of short-time compensation plan participants are permitted to the extent that the reductions also apply to nonparticipant employees.
        </li>
        <li id="t21c17sub03s1452ol1a4">
         The usual total weekly hours of work for employees in the affected unit or units are reduced by not less than 20 percent and not more than 50 percent.
        </li>
        <li id="t21c17sub03s1452ol1a5">
         The plan certifies that the aggregate reduction in work hours is in lieu of layoffs of one or more workers which would have resulted in an equivalent reduction in work hours and which the Commissioner finds would have caused an equivalent dollar amount to be payable in unemployment compensation.
        </li>
        <li id="t21c17sub03s1452ol1a6">
         The plan certifies that the STC employer will notify the Department within 24 hours after any layoff of an employee, at which time the Commissioner shall have the right to terminate the STC plan.
        </li>
        <li id="t21c17sub03s1452ol1a7">
         The identified workweek reduction is applied consistently throughout the duration of the plan unless otherwise approved by the Department. The plan shall not subsidize seasonal employers during the off-season.
        </li>
        <li id="t21c17sub03s1452ol1a8">
         The plan applies to at least 10 percent of the employees in the affected unit, and when determined to be applicable by the Commissioner applies to all affected employees of the unit equally.
        </li>
        <li id="t21c17sub03s1452ol1a9">
         The plan will not subsidize seasonal employers during the off-season, nor subsidize employers who have traditionally used part-time employees or intermittent employment.
        </li>
        <li id="t21c17sub03s1452ol1a10">
         The employer agrees to maintain records relative to the plan for a period of three years and furnish reports relating to the proper conduct of the plan and agrees to allow the Commissioner or his or her authorized representatives access to all records necessary to verify the plan prior to approval and, after approval, to monitor and evaluate application of the plan.
        </li>
        <li id="t21c17sub03s1452ol1a11">
         The plan certifies that the collective bargaining agent or agents for the employees, if any, have agreed to participate in the program. If there is no bargaining unit, the employer specifies how he or she will notify the employees in the affected group and work with them to implement the program once the plan is approved.
        </li>
        <li id="t21c17sub03s1452ol1a12">
         The plan describes the manner in which the requirements of this section will be implemented and where feasible how notice will be given to an employee whose workweek is to be reduced and an estimate of the number of layoffs that would have occurred absent the ability to participate in the short-time compensation program and any other information that the U.S. Secretary of Labor determines is appropriate.
        </li>
        <li id="t21c17sub03s1452ol1a13">
         The employer certifies that the plan is consistent with employer obligations under applicable State and federal laws.

     State Labor Relations Act (SLRA), State Employees Labor Relations Act (SELRA), and Municipal Employees Relations Act (MERA) are closely related and, therefore, should be considered in pari materia as part of one system intended to oversee labor relations.

     It would not make sense to afford aggrieved parties right to appeal from Labor Relations Board (LRB) orders in all proceedings under State Employee Labor Relations Act (SELRA) and Municipal Employees Relations Act (MERA), but to force parties to use indirect appeal route under V.R.C.P. 75 to appeal from LRB orders in identical proceedings under State Labor Relations Act. Board of Trustees of Kellogg-Hubbard Library, Inc. v. Labor Relations Board, 162 Vt. 571, 649 A.2d 784 (1994).
    </p>
    <p>
     Only reasonable interpretation of purpose behind 1976 amendment to State Labor Relations Act (SLRA), State Employee Labor Relations Act (SELRA), and Municipal Employees Relations Act (MERA) is that legislature intended to consolidate general powers and procedures of Labor Relations Board in SELRA and to apply them to proceedings in each of three labor-relations statutes, while leaving intact particular procedures expressly provided for in SLRA and MERA. Board of Trustees of Kellogg-Hubbard Library, Inc. v. Labor Relations Board, 162 Vt. 571, 649 A.2d 784 (1994).
    </p>
    <p>
     Legislature intended to afford aggrieved parties right to appeal to Supreme Court from final decisions in all types of proceedings under each of three statutes administered by Labor Relations Board (State Labor Relations Act (SLRA), State Employee Labor Relations Act (SELRA), and Municipal Employees Relations Act (MERA)). Board of Trustees of Kellogg-Hubbard Library, Inc. v. Labor Relations Board, 162 Vt. 571, 649 A.2d 784 (1994).

     Although 3 V.S.A.
     §
     924(d) of State Employee Labor Relations Act (SELRA) requires Labor Relations Board (LRB) to exercise all powers and follow procedures set forth in SLRA and Municipal Employees Relations Act (MERA), neither SLRA nor MERA includes all of general powers necessary to carry out LRB's responsibilities under those statutes.

        Labor Relations Board had jurisdiction over a day care center, a charitable corporation, alleged to have committed an unfair labor practice under section 1621 of this title since the center was clearly a corporation and, therefore, under subdivision (10) of this section, plainly within the definition of an employer under subdivision (7) of this section, and since the legislature intended to include most nonprofit corporations within the definition of an employer, having specifically excluded only two, hospitals and nursing homes, from it.

         2. Supervisors.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Applying definition of "supervisor" to particular facts requires considerable discretion, and Labor Relations Board's decisions will not be overturned on appeal unless it is shown to be clearly erroneous. In re AFSCME, Local 490, 153 Vt. 318, 571 A.2d 63 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Effective exercise of any one of the powers enumerated in subdivision (13) of this section confers supervisory status on an employee. In re AFSCME, Local 490, 153 Vt. 318, 571 A.2d 63 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        The existence of actual power, rather than the frequency of its use, determines supervisory status. In re AFSCME, Local 490, 153 Vt. 318, 571 A.2d 63 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Detailed regulations do not alone determine whether an employee operating under those regulations can exercise independent judgment within the meaning of subdivision (13) of this section. In re AFSCME, Local 490, 153 Vt. 318, 571 A.2d 63 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Test of whether an employee is a supervisor within the meaning of subdivision (13) of this section is whether or not the individual can effectively exercise the authority granted him; theoretical or paper power will not make one a supervisor, nor do rare or infrequent supervisory acts change the status of an employee to a supervisor. International Association of Firefighters v. Town of Hartford, 146 Vt. 371, 503 A.2d 1143 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Authority to suspend employees for the remainder of a shift does not make an employee a supervisor within the meaning of subdivision (13) of this section. International Association of Firefighters v. Town of Hartford, 146 Vt. 371, 503 A.2d 1143 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Labor relations board properly concluded that deputy fire chief was not a supervisor within the meaning of subdivision (13) of this section, where his authority over fire department employees was of a merely routine nature and did not require independent judgment. International Association of Firefighters v. Town of Hartford, 146 Vt. 371, 503 A.2d 1143 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        An employee does not acquire a supervisor's status by temporarily taking over his supervisor's duties in his absence, nor do rare supervisory acts change an employee into a supervisor. Firefighters of Brattleboro v. Brattleboro Fire Department, 138 Vt. 347, 415 A.2d 243 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where test of whether one was a supervisor was whether one could effectively exercise the authority granted him, theoretical or paper power would not make one a supervisor, so that fire captains who could suspend a firefighter for one day for unfitness for duty, subject to review by the chief and final approval by the town manager, were not supervisors. Firefighters of Brattleboro v. Brattleboro Fire Department, 138 Vt. 347, 415 A.2d 243 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fire department captains were not supervisors within the meaning of subdivision (13) of this section, where they did not make policy decisions, exercised little discretion, generally performed the same duties as firefighters and only directed firefighting in the absence of a superior officer, and did not hire, transfer, lay off, recall, promote, discharge, assign, reward or effectively recommend the same. Firefighters of Brattleboro v. Brattleboro Fire Department, 138 Vt. 347, 415 A.2d 243 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fire department captains were not supervisors by reason of fact they implemented the decisions of the chief, particularly in job assignments; assignment of routine duties pursuant to directives and established procedure does not make one a supervisor. Firefighters of Brattleboro v. Brattleboro Fire Department, 138 Vt. 347, 415 A.2d 243 (1980).

        Labor Relations Board has a large measure of informed discretion in applying the definition of supervisor in subdivision (13) of this section, and it's decision will not be overturned unless shown to be clearly erroneous.

       The Board may prevent any person from engaging in any unfair labor practice listed in section 1621 of this title.
    Whenever a charge is made that any person has engaged in or is engaging in any unfair labor practice, the Board may issue and cause to be served upon such person a complaint stating the charges in that respect and containing a notice of hearing before the Board at a place and time therein fixed at least seven days after the complaint is served.
    The Board may amend the complaint at any time before it issues an order based thereon.
    No complaint shall issue based on any unfair labor practice occurring more than six months prior to the filing of the charge with the Board and the service of a copy thereof upon the person against whom such charge is made, unless the person aggrieved thereby was prevented from filing such charge by reason of service in the U.S. Armed Forces, in which event the six-month period shall be computed from the day of his or her discharge.

    Any proceeding under this section shall, so far as practicable, be conducted in accordance with rules of evidence used in the courts of law or equity.
    The Board shall provide for the making of a transcript of the testimony presented at the hearing.

Officers who serve subpoenas issued by the Board and witnesses attending hearings conducted by the Board shall receive fees and compensation at the same rates as officers and witnesses in causes before the Criminal Division of the Superior Court, to be paid on vouchers of the Board.

       If upon the preponderance of the evidence, the Board finds that any person named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in any such unfair labor practice, it shall state its findings of fact in writing and shall issue and cause to be served on such person an order requiring him or her to cease and desist from such unfair labor practice, and to take such affirmative action as will carry out the policies of this chapter.
    If upon the preponderance of the evidence the Board does not find that the person named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in any such unfair labor practice, it shall state its findings of fact in writing and dismiss the complaint.

       In determining whether a complaint shall issue alleging a violation of subdivision 1621(a)(1) or (2) of this title, and in deciding such cases, the same regulations and rules of decision shall apply irrespective of whether or not labor organization affected is affiliated with a labor organization national or international in scope.

        Where Labor Relations Board found that an employer had committed an unfair labor practice by firing an employee for her leadership of other employees during a labor dispute, a ruling that was issued two years after the Board's hearings in the case, the Board erred in refusing to consider in its computations of the back pay due her the raises she would have received had she not been illegally discharged, since the Board's decision shifted the cost of its delay from the wrongdoer to the wronged, and thereby not only failed to carry out the policies of this chapter as required by subsection (d) of this section, but thwarted those policies by failing to make whole one injured by the practices proscribed by this chapter.

Upon receipt of a signed authorization to commence automatic membership dues deductions from an independent direct support provider, the State shall, as soon as practicable and in any event, not later than 30 calendar days after receiving the authorization, commence withholding from the independent direct support provider's wages the amount of membership dues certified by the labor organization. The State shall transmit the amount withheld to the labor organization on the same day as the independent direct support provider is paid. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require a member of a labor organization to participate in automatic dues deduction.

     State Labor Relations Act (SLRA), State Employees Labor Relations Act (SELRA), and Municipal Employees Relations Act (MERA) are closely related and, therefore, should be considered in pari materia as part of one system intended to oversee labor relations.

    </p>
    <p>
     It would not make sense to afford aggrieved parties right to appeal from Labor Relations Board (LRB) orders in all proceedings under State Employee Labor Relations Act (SELRA) and Municipal Employees Relations Act (MERA), but to force parties to use indirect appeal route under V.R.C.P. 75 to appeal from LRB orders in identical proceedings under State Labor Relations Act. Board of Trustees of Kellogg-Hubbard Library, Inc. v. Labor Relations Board, 162 Vt. 571, 649 A.2d 784 (1994).
    </p>
    <p>
     Only reasonable interpretation of purpose behind 1976 amendment to State Labor Relations Act (SLRA), State Employee Labor Relations Act (SELRA), and Municipal Employees Relations Act (MERA) is that legislature intended to consolidate general powers and procedures of Labor Relations Board in SELRA and to apply them to proceedings in each of three labor-relations statutes, while leaving intact particular procedures expressly provided for in SLRA and MERA. Board of Trustees of Kellogg-Hubbard Library, Inc. v. Labor Relations Board, 162 Vt. 571, 649 A.2d 784 (1994).
    </p>
    <p>
     Although 3 V.S.A.
     §
     924(d) of State Employee Labor Relations Act (SELRA) requires Labor Relations Board (LRB) to exercise all powers and follow procedures set forth in SLRA and Municipal Employees Relations Act (MERA), neither SLRA nor MERA includes all of general powers necessary to carry out LRB's responsibilities under those statutes.

     Legislature intended to afford aggrieved parties right to appeal to Supreme Court from final decisions in all types of proceedings under each of three statutes administered by Labor Relations Board (State Labor Relations Act (SLRA), State Employee Labor Relations Act (SELRA), and Municipal Employees Relations Act (MERA)).

     <p>
      This chapter shall be known as the Vermont Municipal Employee Relations Act.
    It is the purpose and policy of this chapter to prescribe the legitimate rights of both municipal employees and municipal employers in their relations with each other; to provide orderly and peaceful procedures for preventing the interference by either with the legitimate rights of the other; to protect the rights of individual employees to self-organization; to allow individuals to form, join, or assist employee organizations and to bargain collectively; to define and proscribe practices on the part of employee organizations and municipal employers which are harmful to the general welfare; and to protect the rights of the public in connection with labor disputes.

       <p>
        In determining whether administrative assistants working for school district were "confidential employees," Labor Relations Board was not bound by testimony of administrators that they could not rely on the undivided loyalty of assistants if they were included in bargaining unit; notwithstanding the district's claims to the contrary, the Board did address administrators' concerns by noting either the limited extent of the assistants' access to confidential information or the diluted impact of their access to information that was already known or available to the association. Harwood Union High School District v. Harwood Education Ass'n, 172 Vt. 167, 773 A.2d 277 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether administrative assistants working for school district were "confidential employees," Labor Relations Board did not err by evaluating the assistants' duties solely on the basis of evidence of tasks actually performed as of the date of the hearing. Harwood Union High School District v. Harwood Education Ass'n, 172 Vt. 167, 773 A.2d 277 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether administrative assistants working for school district were "confidential employees," Labor Relations Board did not err by addressing the separate components of the assistants' duties concerning personnel administration, the budgetary process, and collective bargaining, without considering those duties in their totality; presumably, the district addressed each of the three areas individually because subdivision (6) of this section explicitly refers to those three areas. Harwood Union High School District v. Harwood Education Ass'n, 172 Vt. 167, 773 A.2d 277 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether administrative assistants working for school district were "confidential employees," Labor Relations Board did not err by requiring the district to demonstrate that the assistants' access to confidential information would adversely affect its conduct of labor relations. Harwood Union High School District v. Harwood Education Ass'n, 172 Vt. 167, 773 A.2d 277 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        The word "incompatible" in subdivision (6) of this section means more than not working well together; in its proper context, the definition requires the Board to accommodate and balance both the employer's interest in protecting its bargaining position and the employee's interest in bargaining collectively. Harwood Union High School District v. Harwood Education Ass'n, 172 Vt. 167, 773 A.2d 277 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether an employee acts in a confidential capacity and thus should be excluded from a bargaining unit, both the Labor Relations Board and the Supreme Court look for guidance to the federal "labor-nexus test," which excludes only those employees who act in a confidential capacity to persons who formulate, determine, and effectuate management policies in the field of labor relations. Harwood Union High School District v. Harwood Education Ass'n, 172 Vt. 167, 773 A.2d 277 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Labor Relations Board is entitled to a large measure of informed discretion in determining whether an employee is a confidential employee under subdivision (6) of this section and thus exempted from inclusion in a collective bargaining unit. In re Local 1201, AFSCME, 143 Vt. 512, 469 A.2d 1176 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Decision of the Labor Relations Board, that the position of dispatcher in the Department of Public Works was that of a confidential employee under subdivision (6) of this section and thus would not be added to the bargaining unit for employees of the Department, was clearly erroneous as a matter of law, since the duties of the dispatcher were essentially clerical and routine, the Board acknowledged that it was unnecessary for the dispatcher to have access to any confidential files concerning union-related matters and made no finding that the dispatcher assisted or acted in a confidential capacity to persons who exercised a managerial function in the field of labor relations. In re Local 1201, AFSCME, 143 Vt. 512, 469 A.2d 1176 (1983).

       <p>
        Definition of "supervisor" is largely fact-based determination, in which Labor Relations Board is afforded large measure of discretion; Board's decision will be overturned only if shown to be clearly erroneous. Harwood Union High School District v. Harwood Education Ass'n, 172 Vt. 167, 773 A.2d 277 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Applying definition of "supervisor" to particular facts requires considerable discretion, and Labor Relations Board's decision will not be overturned on appeal unless it is shown to be clearly erroneous. In re AFSCME, Local 490, 153 Vt. 318, 571 A.2d 63 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Effective exercise of any one of the powers enumerated in section 1502(13) of this title confers supervisory status on an employee. In re AFSCME, Local 490, 153 Vt. 318, 571 A.2d 63 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        The existence of actual power, rather than the frequency of its use, determines supervisory status. In re AFSCME, Local 490, 153 Vt. 318, 571 A.2d 63 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Detailed regulations do not alone determine whether an employee operating under those regulations can exercise independent judgment within the meaning of section 1502(13) of this title. In re AFSCME, Local 490, 153 Vt. 318, 571 A.2d 63 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining that police department sergeants should not be excluded from bargaining unit as supervisory employees, Labor Relations Board did not err by giving great weight to finding that sergeants performed the same duties as patrol officers a significant portion of the time.

        Vermont Department of State's Attorneys and Sheriffs was not an employer of the employees within the State's Attorney's Offices, including deputy state's attorneys, victim advocates, and secretaries, in conjunction with the individual state's attorneys; on the other hand, the individual state's attorneys, who were statutorily authorized county officers, were municipal employers under the Vermont Municipal Employee Relations Act (MERA) to the extent that they employed five or more employees as defined in MERA. The fact that the State's Attorneys might be unable to bargain over the full scope of employment issues with respect to the petitioned-for employees in their offices did not mean that they were not municipal employers under MERA.

        Secretaries with the State's Attorney's Offices are to be considered State employees paid by the state, and shall receive those benefits available to other classified State employees who are similarly situated, but the same statutory subsection provides that the secretaries are not subject to the rules regarding classification of State employees and that they shall be hired by and shall serve at the pleasure of the State's Attorney. In short, although the provision requires that the secretaries be paid as State employees, it also recognizes that they will be hired by and work for a county employer, which makes them municipal employees under the Vermont Municipal Employee Relations Act.

        The provisions of subdivision (a)(8) of this section permitting agency service fee agreements for municipal employees were not extended to teachers by virtue of the enactment of section 1735 of this title, which provides that teachers shall be considered municipal employees for purposes of representation in, and prevention of, unfair labor practices under sections 1726-1729 of this title, since section 1735 also provides that it does not alter or repeal the provisions of the Labor Relations for Teachers Act (16 V.S.A. chapter 57), and agency fee agreements are prohibited by section 1982(a) of that Act.

       </p>
       <p>
        At the heart of any employment discharge allegedly linked to anti-union discrimination is the question of the employer's motivation, and guidelines in examining question whether a discharge was for cause or because of union activity are whether employer knew of the activity, whether there was a climate of coercion and whether the timing of the discharge is suspect.

        Although union contended that because both 21 V.S.A.
        §
        1726(a)(5) and collective bargaining agreement used concept of good faith, all other common law principles in case law and statute were incorporated by reference, neither text of agreement nor history of negotiations leading up to execution of agreement supported rationale. Milton Board of School Directors v. Milton Staff Association, 163 Vt. 240, 656 A.2d 993 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 1726(a)(5) does not impose on contracting parties who include an arbitration clause in their agreement a requirement that they submit post-agreement disputes to arbitration. Milton Board of School Directors v. Milton Staff Association, 163 Vt. 240, 656 A.2d 993 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Parties to collective bargaining agreement may not expand an arbitrator's authority to resolve disputes beyond the terms of the agreement simply because employees union and public employer bargain every contract under the umbrella of the bargaining law and all its interpretations. Milton Board of School Directors v. Milton Staff Association, 163 Vt. 240, 656 A.2d 993 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Arbitrator's theory of contractualization of
        §
        1726(a)(5) was misplaced, and the oblique references to the Vermont Municipal Labor Relations Act in collective bargaining agreement did not imply a mutual agreement to extend any provision of the collective bargaining agreement beyond its expiration date, including an implied agreement to arbitrate disputes arising after that date; therefore, arbitrator lacked authority to hear question of post-expiration compensation and award had to be vacated. Milton Board of School Directors v. Milton Staff Association, 163 Vt. 240, 656 A.2d 993 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The duty to bargain in good faith is an obligation to participate actively in the deliberations, so as to indicate a present intention to find a basis for agreement. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 300 v. Enosburg Falls Water & Light Department, 148 Vt. 26, 527 A.2d 1150 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Employer bad faith bargaining may be manifested in many ways, requiring an analysis of the totality of the employer's conduct within the context in which the bargaining took place in order to determine whether there has been a failure to bargain in good faith. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 300 v. Enosburg Falls Water & Light Department, 148 Vt. 26, 527 A.2d 1150 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that employer's representative at mediation session lacked authority to enter into a binding agreement did not, in and of itself, constitute an unfair labor practice, but was merely some evidence, to be considered in conjunction with other conduct, of employer bad faith bargaining. International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local 300 v. Enosburg Falls Water & Light Department, 148 Vt. 26, 527 A.2d 1150 (1987).

        It is a violation of this section for an employer to refuse to bargain in good faith. Burlington Fire Fighters' Association v. City of Burlington, 142 Vt. 434, 457 A.2d 642 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        When an employer, without first consulting a union with which it is carrying on bona fide contract negotiations, institutes a unilateral change in conditions of employment, it per se violates its duty under subdivision (a)(5) of this section to bargain in good faith. Burlington Fire Fighters' Association v. City of Burlington, 142 Vt. 434, 457 A.2d 642 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a regulation adopted by the City of Burlington in 1974 required fire fighters to be in uniform at all times in the station, a 1980 regulation which allowed the fire fighters to wear casual apparel prior to roll call and after completing their tour of duty constituted a change in a condition of employment as defined by section 1722 of this title, and since the new regulation was unilaterally imposed by the City during a period when it was engaged in contract negotiations with the Fire Fighters Association, the City committed an unfair labor practice. Burlington Fire Fighters' Association v. City of Burlington, 142 Vt. 434, 457 A.2d 642 (1983).

        Where bus company employee working at terminal on "terminal duty" was involved in incident relating to a missing fare box, was fired, asked to be allowed to resign instead, company manager verbally consented, employee's letter of resignation was never accepted, two weeks later he asked for and received reinstatement with no loss of seniority, a couple months later terminal duty came up for bidding and employee, who had the most longevity and thus seniority, was refused the job, partly on ground that union contract gave the shop steward, granted the job, seniority over everyone, it was an unfair labor practice on the part of the union and the company to give the steward such seniority; but because of the fare box incident, company had a legitimate business purpose in not giving employee the terminal duty and employee had no right to recovery.

Burlington Area Public Employees Union v. Champlain Water District, 156 Vt. 516, 594 A.2d 421 (1991).

        Litigation before State Labor Relations Board and State Supreme Court, focusing on issue whether discharge of city employee constituted an unfair labor practice under this section, and not covering constitutional issues regarding the discharge, did not, by means of res judicata, bar federal district court from considering claims of employee that discharge violated constitutional rights.

        In deciding whether constitutional rights were violated by city's discharge of policeman, federal district court was not estopped from making an independent review of any issue decided by the State Labor Relations Board in unfair labor practice proceeding before it, such as whether policeman was a probationary employee and whether he was discharged for cause or for union involvement, but district court was precluded from examining issues fully and fairly litigated in state Supreme Court and concluded by a final judgment, the determination of which was necessary to the judgment rendered.

       The Board may prevent any person from engaging in any unfair labor practice.
    Whenever a charge is made that any person has engaged in or is engaging in any unfair labor practice, the Board may issue and cause to be served upon that person a complaint stating the charges and containing a notice of hearing before the Board at a place and time noted therein which shall be at least 14 days after the complaint is served.
    The Board may amend the complaint at any time before it issues an order based thereon.
    No complaint shall issue based on any unfair labor practice occurring more than six months prior to the filing of the charge with the Board unless the person aggrieved thereby was prevented from filing the charge by reason of service in the U.S. Armed Forces, in which event the six-month period shall be computed from the day of his or her discharge.
    The Board may waive the six-month period if it finds that:
       <ol>
        <li id="t21c22s1727ol1a1">
         the aggrieved person did not understand that an unfair labor practice had been perpetrated against him or her; or

        <li id="t21c22s1727ol1a2">
         the offending person had actively concealed his, her, or its perpetration of that unfair labor practice.

       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t21c22s1727ol1b">
       The person complained of shall have the right to file an answer to the original or amended complaint and appear in person or through his or her representative and present evidence in connection therewith at the time and place fixed in the complaint.
    In the discretion of the Board, any other person may be permitted to intervene and present evidence in the matter.
    Any proceeding under this section shall so far as practicable, be conducted in accordance with rules of evidence used in the courts of law or equity.
    The Board shall provide for the making of a transcript of the testimony presented at the hearing.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c22s1727ol1c">
       The Board shall have power to administer oaths and take testimony under oath relative to the matter of inquiry.
    At any hearing ordered by the Board, the Board shall have the power to subpoena witnesses and to demand the production of books, papers, records, and documents for its examination. Officers who serve subpoenas issued by the Board and witnesses attending hearings conducted by the Board shall receive fees and compensation at the same rates as officers and witnesses in cases before the Criminal Division of the Superior Court, to be paid on vouchers of the Board.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c22s1727ol1d">
       If upon the preponderance of the evidence, the Board finds that any person named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in any unfair labor practice, it shall state its finding of fact in writing and shall issue and cause to be served on that person an order requiring him or her to cease and desist from the unfair labor practice, and to take such affirmative action as the Board shall order.
    If upon the preponderance of the evidence the Board does not find that the person named in the complaint has engaged in or is engaging in any unfair labor practice, it shall state its findings of fact in writing and dismiss the complaint.
      </li>
      <li id="t21c22s1727ol1e">
       In determining whether a complaint shall issue alleging that an unfair labor practice has been committed, and in deciding those cases, the same regulations and rules of decision shall apply irrespective of whether the employee organization affected is affiliated with an employee organization national or international in scope.

       No order of the Board shall require the reinstatement of any individual as an employee who has been suspended or discharged or the payment to him or her of any back pay, if such individual has recourse to binding arbitration under a labor contract grievance procedure for such suspension or discharge.

        Where Labor Relations Board concluded that school board converted a walkout into an unfair labor practice by unilaterally deleting provisions from its teacher employment policy, its order requiring the school board to add those provisions to its contract offer and reinstate striking teachers who offered to return to work unconditionally under the amended contract was well within the Board's discretion under subsection (d) of this section.
