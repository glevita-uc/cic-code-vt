        Since in enacting subsection (d) of this section, prohibiting submission of a false claim for services to Medicaid recipients, the Legislature omitted use of the word "fraud," that omission, in preference for other language, plainly excluded fraud as an element. State v. Dorn, 145 Vt. 606, 496 A.2d 451 (1985), modified on other grounds, Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128, 110 S. Ct. 2301, 110 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (d) of this section, prohibiting submission of a false claim for services to Medicaid recipients or a claim for unauthorized items or services, expressly criminalizes "knowingly" filing either a false claim, or a claim for unauthorized services, since the word "or" in its phrase, "(a) person . . . who knowingly files a false claim or a claim for unauthorized items or services," distinguishes two distinct kinds of "claims" and divides two separate and independently operative provisions. State v. Dorn, 145 Vt. 606, 496 A.2d 451 (1985), modified on other grounds, Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128, 110 S. Ct. 2301, 110 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        A person of reasonable intelligence would understand that deliberate overcharges are prohibited by subsection (d) of this section prohibiting filing of false claims for services to Medicaid recipients. State v. Dorn, 145 Vt. 606, 496 A.2d 451 (1985), modified on other grounds, Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128, 110 S. Ct. 2301, 110 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        A person who filed a claim seeking reimbursement for services to Medicaid recipients for less than his or her usual and customary charge to the public would not have filed a false claim as far as the government is concerned, because the usual and customary charge was in fact at least as much as the reimbursement claimed, with no overcharge to the prejudice of the government. State v. Dorn, 145 Vt. 606, 496 A.2d 451 (1985), modified on other grounds, Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128, 110 S. Ct. 2301, 110 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1990).

       <p>
        Failure of trial court to charge deliberate overcharging as element of offense of knowingly filing false Medicaid claims and failure of State to prove alleged element did not constitute error. State v. Venman, 151 Vt. 561, 564 A.2d 574 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where doctor charged with knowingly filing false Medicaid claims wrote in daily log that patient was referred by another physician and no referral occurred, jury could have concluded that doctor knew what was meant by "consultation" and knowingly billed Medicaid program for consultation where none occurred. State v. Venman, 151 Vt. 561, 564 A.2d 574 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Requirement in subsection (d) of this section, prohibiting submission of a false claim for services to Medicaid recipients, of knowing falsity means that the State must establish defendant's guilty knowledge beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Dorn, 145 Vt. 606, 496 A.2d 451 (1985), modified on other grounds, Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128, 110 S. Ct. 2301, 110 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        At trial of pharmacist for claiming Medicaid reimbursement that exceeded his usual and customary charge to the general public, a jury instruction on fraudulent intent was not required. State v. Dorn, 145 Vt. 606, 496 A.2d 451 (1985), modified on other grounds, Horton v. California, 496 U.S. 128, 110 S. Ct. 2301, 110 L. Ed. 2d 112 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence introduced by State established occurrence of events affecting welfare recipient's right to benefits, including receipt of support checks from her husband after they were assigned to Department of Social Welfare in exchange for supplemental benefits, as well as her failure to promptly disclose such events to Department, and was sufficient to support guilty verdict on charge that recipient had knowledge of occurrence of event affecting her rights to benefits under welfare laws, and in failing to promptly disclose such event was intending to fraudulently secure payment in a greater amount than was due. State v. Daigle, 136 Vt. 178, 385 A.2d 1115 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where welfare recipient maintained that because of her misunderstanding of effect of assignment of her support checks to Department of Social Welfare and, consequently, her duty to turn over to Department support checks subsequently received by her, she had neither knowledge of occurrence of any event affecting her rights to benefits, nor intent fraudulently to secure payment in a greater amount than was due, it was reversible error for trial court to instruct jury that it should consider whether recipient's alleged misunderstanding was reasonable, allowing court to substitute unreasonable lack of knowledge for actual knowledge. State v. Daigle, 136 Vt. 178, 385 A.2d 1115 (1978).

         1. Due process.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Under this section and section 2852 (now
        §
        3502) of this title, registered operators of family day care centers have a property interest in continued registration which is protected by the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Gour v. Morse, 652 F. Supp. 1166 (D. Vt. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        While due process does not require that the Department hold a full-blown evidentiary hearing before revoking a license under subsection (b) of this section, it does require that the Department provide licensees whose registrations it intends to revoke with oral or written notice of the charges against them, an explanation of the Department's evidence, and an opportunity to present reason, even if only in writing, why the proposed action should not be taken. Gour v. Morse, 652 F. Supp. 1166 (D. Vt. 1987).

         3. Immunity.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The licensing and inspection of day-care facilities are inherently governmental functions, the primary purpose of which is to enforce compliance with the law, not to render services to the facilities, which functions find no private analog or duty of care in the common law. Accordingly, under the Vermont Tort Claims Act plaintiffs' action for the wrongful death of their son, who died when he became entangled in a curtain cord while in his crib at a licensed facility, was barred. Lafond v. Department of Social & Rehabilitation Servs., 167 Vt. 407, 708 A.2d 919 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        District director in a child welfare office was protected by qualified immunity in her communications with out-of-state counterpart regarding alleged child sexual abuse because the communication was ordered by the court and the director acted in good faith.

       </h5>
       <p>
        In absence of clear guidance from Legislature or courts, dictum in State v. Merritt, 149 Vt. 529, 546 A.2d 791 (1988), standing alone, was insufficient to create a "clearly established" right, under this section, upon which plaintiff could base suit against police officers for failure to take into protective custody individual who subsequently, while driving while intoxicated, had car accident which injured plaintiff. Napolitano v. Flynn, 949 F.2d 617 (2d Cir. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure of police officer to take intoxicated defendant into protective custody before alleged offense occurred did not estop the state from prosecuting defendant for operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. State v. Merritt, 149 Vt. 529, 546 A.2d 791 (1988).

        The State, in choosing to participate in the federal ANFC program, cannot administer its State program in conflict with federal laws, statutes, or regulations controlling such welfare programs. In re Fowler, 130 Vt. 176, 288 A.2d 463 (1972).

       <p>
        Congress, in passing the ANFC program, intended the term "parent" to mean only an individual who owed the child a state-imposed legal duty of support. In re Fowler, 130 Vt. 176, 288 A.2d 463 (1972).

        Where stepfather did not stand in the legal status of loco parentis at the time natural mother was refused ANFC benefits, Social Welfare Board's decision that such benefits should not be paid was erroneous. In re Fowler, 130 Vt. 176, 288 A.2d 463 (1972).

        Where evidence supported findings that although daughter spent about equal time with each parent, her primary home was with mother, who provided most of her food, clothing, and financial support as well as space where the child kept all of her belongings, conclusions that child's father was an absent parent within the meaning of State regulations governing welfare assistance and that his absence interrupted his ability to provide physical care and guidance for the child and decision reversing termination of mother's benefits under the Aid to Needy Families with Children would be affirmed.

        Vermont statute regarding Medicaid liens allows the State to assert its lien only to the extent of the amount paid by the Agency. By its plain language, the statute does not allow the State to assert a lien against any recovery for money not paid by Medicaid. Doe v. Vt. Office of Health Access, 191 Vt. 517, 54 A.3d 474 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendment to the statute regarding liens in Medicaid cases to provide that a recipient's attorney "may withhold the agency's pro rata share of reasonably necessary attorneys' fees, costs, and expenses incurred in asserting the claim" was a change and not a clarification. The statute formerly in place, providing that the attorney for the recipient "may negotiate an attorney fee with the agency," indicated that where the recipient and the State independently made an allocation to recover medical expenses, the parties could discuss deducting attorney's fees from the State's lien; the statute did not, however, put limits on a court's authority to reduce the State's lien by subtracting attorney's fees where the court is making an allocation. Doe v. Vt. Office of Health Access, 191 Vt. 517, 54 A.3d 474 (2012).

        Once a Medicaid recipient initiated negotiations pursuant to the statute regarding Medicaid liens, the State was required to negotiate in good faith and in accordance with its general practice of reducing its lien claims by a proportionate share of attorney's fees. The trial court failed to take into account the State's practice, and therefore abused its discretion in denying the recipient's request to reduce the State's judgment by the amount of reasonable attorney's fees. Doe v. Vt. Office of Health Access, 191 Vt. 517, 54 A.3d 474 (2012).

        In a suit involving a state Medicaid lien, discounting future damages to present value was unwarranted. The differential between the parties' figures was colossal, and the State simply did not prove that its figure was more fair or was accurate. Doe v. Vt.

        By its plain language, Vermont's reimbursement statute, before its amendment in 2008, does not allow the State to assert a lien against any recovery for money not paid by Medicaid. Accordingly, the trial court erred in allowing the State to assert its lien against all medical expenses beyond those which were paid by Medicaid. Doe v. Vt. Office of Health Access, 191 Vt. 517, 54 A.3d 474 (2012).

The statute did not, however, put limits on a court's authority to reduce the State's lien by subtracting attorney's fees where the court is making an allocation. Doe v. Vt.

       Cigarette smoking presents serious public health concerns to the State of Vermont and to the citizens of Vermont. The Surgeon General has determined that smoking causes lung cancer, heart disease, and other serious diseases, and that there are hundreds of thousands of tobacco-related deaths in the United States each year. These diseases most often do not appear until many years after a person begins smoking.
      </li>
      <li id="t33p02c19sub1As1912ol1b">
       Cigarette smoking also presents serious financial concerns for the State. Under certain health care programs, the State may have a legal obligation to provide medical assistance to eligible persons for health conditions associated with cigarette smoking, and those persons may have a legal entitlement to receive such medical assistance. Under these programs, the State pays millions of dollars each year to provide medical assistance to these persons for health conditions associated with cigarette smoking.
      </li>
      <li id="t33p02c19sub1As1912ol1c">
       It is the policy of the State that financial burdens imposed on the State by cigarette smoking be borne by tobacco product manufacturers rather than by the State to the extent that such manufacturers either determine to enter into a settlement with the State or are found culpable by the courts.
      </li>
      <li id="t33p02c19sub1As1912ol1d">
       On November 23, 1998, leading U.S. tobacco product manufacturers entered into a settlement agreement, entitled the "Master Settlement Agreement," with the State. In return for a release of past, present, and certain future claims against these manufacturers as described therein, the Master Settlement Agreement obligates these manufacturers to:
       <ol>
        <li id="t33p02c19sub1As1912ol1d1">
         pay substantial sums to the State, tied in part to their volume of sales;
        </li>
        <li id="t33p02c19sub1As1912ol1d2">
         fund a national foundation devoted to the interests of public health; and
        </li>
        <li id="t33p02c19sub1As1912ol1d3">
         make substantial changes in their advertising and marketing practices and corporate culture, with the intention of reducing underage smoking.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t33p02c19sub1As1912ol1e">
       It would be contrary to the policy of the State if tobacco product manufacturers who determine not to enter into such a settlement could use a resulting cost advantage to derive large, short-term profits in the years before liability may arise, without ensuring that the State will have an eventual source of recovery from them if they are proven to have acted culpably. Consequently, it is in the interest of the State to require that such manufacturers establish a reserve fund to guarantee a source of compensation, and to prevent such manufacturers from deriving large, short-term profits and then becoming judgment-proof before liability may arise.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Payments under this section are not welfare type benefits for a person such as a relative of a deceased person who arranges for and makes payments for the burial, as evidenced by the fact that only the status of the decedent, and not the status of the person arranging the burial, is considered in determining whether or not payments shall be made; therefore, the payments do not constitute "assistance" or "benefits" for purposes of section 3091 of Title 3, which provides applicant or recipient for "assistance" or "benefits" with right to hearing before Human Services Board. Vigario v. Department of Social Welfare, 140 Vt. 100, 436 A.2d 768 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        In some cases, payments by the Department of Social Welfare under this section may help to defray the funeral expenses paid by the relatives of a deceased person when they arrange for burial, but this does not make relatives recipients of assistance or benefits under section 3091 of Title 3, which provides applicants or recipients of assistance or benefits right to hearing before Human Services Board, since any financial benefit to relatives of deceased is only incidental for purpose of this section. Vigario v. Department of Social Welfare, 140 Vt. 100, 436 A.2d 768 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where relative of decedent who was entitled to benefits under this section instituted claim for reimbursement of expenses which she had incurred in connection with burial of decedent, since she was not entitled to payment under this section, she was not an applicant for assistance or benefits within the meaning of section 3091 of Title 3, conferring the right to a hearing before the Human Services Board, and the Board therefore lacked jurisdiction to hear her claim.

        Under this section, when a person dies, immediate action to authorize burial should be taken by public officials unless, at that time, they have knowledge that the deceased had sufficient assets or they have knowledge of relatives legally liable for the costs or of some other person who is willing to assume responsibility. 1968-70 Op.

        Under this section, the only parties eligible to receive payments from the Department of Social Welfare are funeral directors and towns required to arrange for burials for persons without assets; daughter of person eligible for payment of funeral expenses by Department could not receive payments under this section.

        This section is to be given literal interpretation and payment of burial expenses must be made upon certification by the proper agency that there are no known assets, etc., at the time the need for the funeral arrangements arises. 1968-70 Op. Atty. Gen. 215.

         The State program shall provide an enhanced weatherization assistance amount exceeding the federal per unit limit allowing amounts up to an average of $8,500.00 per unit allocated on a cost-effective basis. The allowable average per unit may be adjusted to account for the lower cost per unit of multifamily buildings. In units where costs exceed the allowable average by more than 25 percent, prior approval of the Director of the State Economic Opportunity Office shall be required before work commences. This amount shall be adjusted annually by increasing the last year's amount by the percentage increase in the Consumer Price Index for the previous year.

        Definition of "household" in Vermont Home Heating Fuel Assistance regulations was inconsistent with definition found in federal Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Act; plain meaning of federal act's phrase "living together as one economic unit" implied that the individuals must depend on one another for financial support, and Congress did not intend homeowners with low income to be excluded from the fuel program merely because they had lodgers living in their homes.

       <p>
        Inconsistency between Vermont and federal definitions of "household," for purposes of determining eligibility for fuel assistance, resulted in denial or reduction of assistance to certain households in violation of federal act, where Vermont regulations automatically included income and assets of all persons - including a boarder - living at the same residence and sharing a primary heating unit, regardless of the relationship between them or their cost-sharing arrangements.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The General Assembly adopts the following principles with regard to strengthening Vermont's response to trauma and toxic stress during childhood:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t33p03c34s3401ol11">
       Childhood trauma affects all aspects of society. Each of Vermont's systems addressing trauma, particularly social services; health care, including mental health; education; child care; and the justice system, shall collaborate to address the causes and symptoms of childhood trauma and to build resilience.
      </li>
      <li id="t33p03c34s3401ol12">
       Addressing trauma in Vermont requires building resilience in those individuals already affected and preventing childhood trauma within the next generation.
      </li>
      <li id="t33p03c34s3401ol13">
       Early childhood adversity is common and can be prevented. When adversity is not prevented, early intervention is essential to ameliorate the impacts of adversity. A statewide, community-based, interconnected, public health and social service approach is necessary to address this effectively. This model shall include training for local leaders to facilitate a cultural change around the prevention and treatment of childhood trauma.
      </li>
      <li id="t33p03c34s3401ol14">
       Service systems shall be integrated at the local and regional levels to maximize resources and simplify how systems respond to individual and family needs. All programs and services shall be evidence-informed and research-based, adhering to best practices in addressing trauma and promoting resilience.

       "Childhood adversity" means experiences that may be traumatic to children and youths during the first 18 years of life, such as experiencing violence or other emotionally disturbing exposures in their homes or communities.
      </li>

       "Resilience" means the ability to respond to, withstand, and recover from serious hardship with coping skills and a combination of protective factors, including a strong community, family support, social connections, knowledge of parenting and child development, concrete support in times of need, and social and emotional competence of children.
      </li>
      <li id="t33p03c34s3402ol13">
       "Toxic stress" means strong, frequent, or prolonged experience of adversity without adequate support.
      </li>
      <li id="t33p03c34s3402ol14">
       "Trauma-informed" means a type of program, organization, or system that recognizes the widespread impact of trauma and potential paths for recovery; recognizes the signs and symptoms of trauma in clients, families, staff, and others involved in a system; responds by fully integrating knowledge about trauma into policies, procedures, and practices; and seeks actively to resist retraumatization and build resilience among the population served.

        This section does not give the Family Court jurisdiction to order repayment of public assistance benefits paid to an individual by another state because its terms limit the right to recoupment to Vermont's Department of Prevention, Assistance, Transition, and Health Access; thus, where the State of Vermont did not pay out any of the benefits for which the Vermont Office of Child Support (OCS) sought recovery, and OCS did not receive an assignment of rights from mother to seek child support from father, the statute could not support the court's jurisdiction over OCS's claim because the claim fell outside its plain language.

       The General Assembly finds that early intervention and family support services offers the chance for children at risk of school failure to enter school better prepared to learn. Children who succeed in school are more likely to fulfill their potential as adults. An early investment in a child's learning potential may lessen the need for remedial services. The role of parents as their child's first teachers should be strengthened through a community-based system of early childhood services that provide the earliest opportunity to identify and serve children at risk of school failure. The State shall provide, or assist parents in the provision of such aid through community-based public or private early childhood development services for as long as the parents are eligible and continue to desire such services for themselves and their children. However, parents may refuse aid or services or may discontinue these services at any time without incurring any record or presumption of neglect or abuse based solely on their decision to reject these services.
      </li>
      <li id="t33p03c47s4701ol1b">
       The General Assembly finds that early education contributes to the health of our society just as importantly as does good nutrition and proper immunization. Children's healthy intellectual development is greatly enhanced by their early and consistent exposure to books and other educational materials and experiences. The General Assembly also finds that opportunity for school success may be enhanced for children at risk of school failure by providing parents of such children with information on a variety of approaches to child development.
      </li>
      <li id="t33p03c47s4701ol1c">
       The General Assembly finds that currently available early child development services are provided by many State departments and community agencies, but they are not uniformly available or coordinated or sufficiently well known by parents.
      </li>
      <li id="t33p03c47s4701ol1d">
       Therefore, it is the policy of the State of Vermont and this chapter to offer all families assistance in the preparation of their children for school, from the time of birth onward, through a community-based education and human services system with the capability to identify preschool children at risk of school failure and to reduce this number through health, education, and family support programs. It is the goal of this chapter that few children enter school at risk of school failure, and that those who do have been previously identified where possible and have received appropriate early education, child care, and health care services on a voluntary basis. A goal of this chapter is to widely disseminate public information about State laws related to child abuse and neglect.

After an informational meeting and prior to family participation in any screenings or services to be conducted in the home, the provider visiting the home shall explain the confidentiality policies and abuse and neglect reporting requirements. A parent shall be required to sign a form acknowledging their awareness of these policies and requirements.

Two weeks in advance of these meetings, documents that fully describe program activities, including reports, budgets, plans, and working guidelines, shall be made available to school boards in program service areas and at the area lead agency. These meetings shall be co-chaired by an elected school board director or superintendent in the district and an official of the program's lead agency.

     §
    
    1 provides: "(a) In 2014, the tragic deaths of two children exposed problems with Vermont's system intended to protect children from abuse and neglect. This act is intended to address these problems and implement the recommendations of the Joint Legislative Committee on Child Protection created by 2014 Acts and Resolves No. 179, Sec. C.109 and improve our State's system for protecting our children to help prevent future tragedies.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(b) To better prevent child abuse and neglect, Vermont must invest in proven strategies to support and strengthen families.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(c) To better protect Vermont's children from abuse and neglect, and to address the increasing burden of drug abuse and other factors that are ripping families apart, the General Assembly believes that our State's child protection system must be focused on the safety and best interests of children, and be comprehensive and properly funded. This system must ensure that:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(1) the dedicated frontline professionals, including guardians ad litem, who struggle to handle the seemingly ever-increasing caseloads have the support, training, and resources necessary to do their job;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) children who have suffered abuse and neglect can find safe, nurturing, and permanent homes, whether with their custodial parents, relatives, or other caring families and individuals;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(3) the most serious cases of abuse are thoroughly investigated and prosecuted if appropriate;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(4) courts have the information and tools necessary to make the best possible decisions;
    </p>
    <p>
     "(5) all participants in the child protection system, from the frontline caseworker to the judge determining ultimate custody, work together to prioritize the child's safety and best interests; and
    </p>
    <p>
     "(6) an effective oversight structure is established.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(d) This act is only the beginning of what must be an ongoing process in which the House and Senate Committees on Judiciary, the Senate Committee on Health and Welfare, the House Committee on Human Services, in consultation with the Senate and House Committees on Appropriations, continue to enhance the statewide approach to the prevention of child abuse and neglect."

       </h5>
       <p>
        For purposes of Social Security benefits, foster care payments to foster parents are to be considered property of the foster parents rather than support from State to child, where provision of this section defines foster care as "care of a child, for a valuable consideration," and Department of Social Welfare regulations refer to foster care as "purchased," and foster parents are given near-total freedom in spending the payments.

       "Abused or neglected child" means a child whose physical health, psychological growth and development, or welfare is harmed or is at substantial risk of harm by the acts or omissions of his or her parent or other person responsible for the child's welfare. An "abused or neglected child" also means a child who is sexually abused or at substantial risk of sexual abuse by any person and a child who has died as a result of abuse or neglect.
      </li>
      <li id="t33p03c49sub02s4912ol12">
       "Assessment" means a response to a report of child abuse or neglect that focuses on the identification of the strengths and support needs of the child and the family and any services they may require to improve or restore their well-being and to reduce the risk of future harm.

         1. Registry.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Legal and policy standards governing the registry process are plain, and they do not require, nor contemplate, any inquiry into whether the Department for Children and Families (DCF) is also pursuing a child-in-need-of-care-or-supervision petition (CHINS) in family court; thus, the Human Services Board erred in concluding that the DCF could not list a mother in its child-abuse-and-neglect registry unless it also filed a CHINS petition. The registry law clearly addresses the acts or omissions of parents and other individuals, not DCF's response to these actions. In re M.E., 189 Vt. 114, 15 A.3d 112 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Two statutory procedures of the child-abuse-and-neglect registry and a child-in-need-of-care-or-supervision (CHINS) proceeding are distinct and are in no way dependent on one another. Obviously, the initiation of a CHINS proceeding implicates fundamental interests not at stake in the registry process. In re M.E., 189 Vt. 114, 15 A.3d 112 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Department for Children and Families (DCF) looks to the degree of misconduct involved in the action of the parent or caretaker and reserves child protection registry inclusion in single incident cases for misconduct that is egregious - that is, outrageously bad or reprehensible. The DCF's approach is consistent with the statute which requires that the risk of harm to the child be "substantial" and create "significant" danger, and the Vermont Supreme Court adopts DCF's interpretation of the statute, finding no compelling indication of error in it. In re R.H., 189 Vt. 15, 14 A.3d 267 (2010).

         2. Substantiation.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Decision to file a child-in-need-of-care-or-supervision (CHINS) petition simply does not prove or disprove that a child was in fact put at "risk of harm" by his or her parent. The Vermont Supreme Court rejects the conclusion that the Department for Children and Families' discretionary decision to file a petition to have a child declared as CHINS should determine whether a report of abuse or neglect has been "substantiated." In re M.E., 189 Vt. 114, 15 A.3d 112 (2010).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Definitions statute expressly states that the terms defined therein are for use in that particular subchapter, which deals with the reporting of child abuse for potential placement on the child protection registry. The statutes governing the registry process, found in chapter 49 of Title 33, have legislative goals, functions, and procedures completely different from those governing juvenile proceedings in family court now reorganized in chapter 51; thus, the Court declines to adopt, for purposes of juvenile proceedings, the definition of abuse set forth in that statute. In re M.K., 198 Vt. 233, 114 A.3d 107 (2015).

       The text of subsec. (a) is based on the harmonization of two amendments. During the 2011 Adjourned Session, subsec.

In order to reflect all of the changes enacted by the Legislature during the 2011 Adjourned Session, the text of Act Nos. 156 and 159 was merged to arrive at a single version of subsec. (a). The changes that each of the amendments made are described in the amendment notes set out below.

The Department shall begin either an assessment or an investigation within 72 hours after the receipt of a report made pursuant to section 4914 of this title, provided that it has sufficient information to proceed. The Commissioner may waive the 72-hour requirement only when necessary to locate the child who is the subject of the allegation or to ensure the safety of the child or social worker.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Vermont law did not clearly require a more thorough investigation of abuse than was in fact conducted; social workers thus had a reasonable basis to believe that their abuse investigation was consistent with family's rights under State law at the time, and social workers were therefore entitled to qualified immunity. Wilkinson v. Russell, 182 F.3d 89 (2d Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1155, 120 S. Ct. 1160, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1072 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where evidence could not support a conclusion by the fact-finder that social worker defendants had not violated their statutory duties under this section, summary judgment for defendants, on ground that defendants were protected by qualified immunity as a matter of law, was inappropriate. Sabia v. Neville, 165 Vt. 515, 687 A.2d 469 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is beyond dispute that
        §
        4911 of this title and this section create a duty on the part of the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services to assist a particular class of persons to which plaintiffs belong (child abuse victims) and to prevent the type of harm suffered by plaintiffs (sexual abuse by their stepfather). Sabia v. State, 164 Vt. 293, 669 A.2d 1187 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not require the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services (SRS) in all instances to remove abused or neglected children from their home, but it does require the Department to thoroughly investigate charges of abuse and to cause assistance to be provided pursuant to a written plan of treatment when an investigation produces evidence of abuse or neglect. Sabia v. State, 164 Vt. 293, 669 A.2d 1187 (1995).

         2. Interview.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Social worker investigating a claim of child abuse is authorized to interview a possible victim outside presence of a disinterested adult only with approval of the child's parents, guardian, or custodian. Wilkinson v. Russell, 182 F.3d 89 (2d Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1155, 120 S. Ct. 1160, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1072 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Qualified immunity shielded social workers from liability in connection with their alleged violation of this section, where it was not clearly established under Vermont law that they needed permission from both parents, as opposed to just one, in order to proceed with interviews of possible child abuse victim. Wilkinson v. Russell, 182 F.3d 89 (2d Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1155, 120 S. Ct. 1160, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1072 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section requires the presence of a disinterested adult only when the interview of a child takes place without the approval of the child's parents, guardian, or custodian. Because the child's mother gave permission for the child to be interviewed, the father could not claim a violation of this section. Wilkinson ex rel. Wilkinson v. Russell, 973 F. Supp. 437 (D. Vt. 1997), aff'd, 182 F.3d 89 (2d Cir. 1999), cert. denied, 528 U.S. 1155, 120 S. Ct. 1160, 145 L. Ed. 2d 1072 (2000).

        Department for Children and Families (DCF) looks to the degree of misconduct involved in the action of the parent or caretaker and reserves child protection registry inclusion in single incident cases for misconduct that is egregious - that is, outrageously bad or reprehensible. The DCF's approach is consistent with the statute which requires that the risk of harm to the child be "substantial" and create "significant" danger, and the Vermont Supreme Court adopts DCF's interpretation of the statute, finding no compelling indication of error in it. In re R.H., 189 Vt. 15, 14 A.3d 267 (2010).

        Evidence required to support the listing of a substantiated child abuse investigation does not require proof that the act was committed to satisfy sexual desires of either the perpetrator or the victim as required by 13 V.S.A.

        2602, lewd or lascivious conduct with a child. Passion v. Department of Social & Rehabilitation Services, 166 Vt. 596, 689 A.2d 459 (mem.) (1997).

        That the sexual abuse registry statute was seemingly contradictory to other public policies of the State, evidenced in statutes like
        §
        5501 of this title, which seek to remove from children committing delinquent acts the taint of criminality and the consequences of criminal behavior, was not sufficient to overcome the Legislature's intent to treat child sexual abuse as a special area of concern warranting different treatment.

         4. Expungement of records.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Based on collateral estoppel, the Human Services Board properly denied a mother an evidentiary hearing to expunge her name from the child abuse registry. A family court's determination that a child was in need of care or supervision, based upon the mother's stipulation, precluded relitigation of whether the child had been nutritionally neglected. In re P.J., 185 Vt. 606, 969 A.2d 133 (mem.) (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order of the Human Services Board expunging mother's name from the child-abuse registry was not reversed where the facts did not make out child abuse as a matter of law. K.G. v. Department of Social & Rehabilitation Services, 171 Vt. 529, 758 A.2d 323 (mem.) (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Father's name was required to be expunged from state child-abuse registry, where quality of hearsay evidence militated against assigning any accuracy or reliability to statements of child implicating her father. In re C.M., 168 Vt. 389, 721 A.2d 1176 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plain language of hearsay exception contained in V.R.E. 804a indicated that Legislature intended it to apply to any civil, criminal, or administrative proceeding in which statements concerning child sexual abuse are offered, and therefore this provision, rather than Human Services Board's more relaxed hearsay rule, governed admissibility of child hearsay statements in hearings for expungement of names from State child-abuse registry. In re C.M., 168 Vt. 389, 721 A.2d 1176 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner could not raise the issue of a violation of the provision of this section requiring the destruction of records, where he failed to object to testimony regarding an incident of prior sexual abuse on that basis at the hearing before the Human Services Board. Passion v. Department of Social & Rehabilitation Services, 166 Vt. 596, 689 A.2d 459 (mem.) (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        When conducting hearings regarding the expungement of investigation records held by the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services, the Human Services Board receives evidence and reviews the Department's decision de novo. In re Bushey-Combs, 160 Vt. 326, 628 A.2d 541 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order by Human Services Board to expunge report of sexual abuse within registry of Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services was not error where Department failed to meet its burden to show why record of abuse should not be expunged. In re Bushey-Combs, 160 Vt. 326, 628 A.2d 541 (1993).

         5. Extent of expungement.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The obvious purpose of subsection (g)'s concluding phrase, "and the name of the person about whom the report was made," which was added by the Legislature in 1990, was to prevent loss of the perpetrator's name when the abused child's name was expunged from the registry. In re Selivonik, 164 Vt. 383, 670 A.2d 831 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although petitioner argued that Legislature intended to allow expungement of child perpetrators when they became adults, in the context of a statute whose main purpose is the prevention of child abuse, the more persuasive interpretation is that the names of perpetrators were to be maintained regardless of age. In re Selivonik, 164 Vt. 383, 670 A.2d 831 (1995).

       </h5>
       <p>
        A person included in the sexual abuse registry has the right at any time to petition for expungement and is entitled to a fair hearing conducted under the preponderance standard; a higher standard at the investigatory stage is not necessary to meet due process concerns because of the availability of such a hearing at any time after inclusion in the registry.

       <p>
        In reversing a decision including a mother in the child protection registry on the ground that there had been a risk of harm to the child but that no purpose would be served by placing the mother's name in the registry, the Human Services Board failed to follow the plain language of the statute. It had no discretion to conflate the two distinct statutory procedures of substantiation and expungement, and it erred in considering whether the mother was likely to commit similar acts of negligence in the future. In re R.H., 189 Vt. 15, 14 A.3d 267 (2010).

         1. Administrative review.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Human Services Board properly held that it lacked jurisdiction over an appeal from a substantiation of child abuse. The appeal, which was filed more than 10 months after notice of the substantiation, was untimely under the statute governing administrative review in such cases. In re Beer, 187 Vt. 641, 996 A.2d 225 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Deadlines listed in the statute dealing with challenging placement on the child abuse registry are solely procedural and therefore fall under a general exception to the statute that deals with an amendment's retroactive effects on substantive rights. Furthermore, the deadlines in the registry statute were not in fact being applied retroactively, since petitioner had no appellate rights in the case until the date the charge was substantiated at which point the amendment adding the deadlines was already in effect. In re Beer, 187 Vt. 641, 996 A.2d 225 (mem.) (2010).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        When petitioner failed to take the steps necessary to secure a merits hearing on a substantiation of child abuse, there was no due process violation, since petitioner was plainly provided adequate notice of the agency's decision and informed of his right to appeal. There was no due process violation when a board simply enforced its properly noticed filing deadlines, as occurred here. In re Beer, 187 Vt. 641, 996 A.2d 225 (mem.) (2010).

         3. Disclosure of documents.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Because petitioner failed to file a timely appeal of a substantiation of child abuse, the Human Services Board properly found that it lacked jurisdiction to hold an administrative review conference regarding the merits of the case; thus, the Board was not required to disclose any documents to petitioner. The statute governing challenging placement on the child abuse registry required the disclosure of redacted documents only when an administrative review conference was going to take place. In re Beer, 187 Vt. 641, 996 A.2d 225 (mem.) (2010).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        On petitioner's challenge to the inclusion of her name on the Child Protection Registry, the evidence did not support the Human Services Board's order upholding a 2004 substantiation for presenting a risk of harm to a child. An anonymous report that petitioner was abusing drugs in 2004 could not alone support the substantiation; the 2004 substantiation determination could not rest on petitioner's 2011 admissions; and without any evidence that the child was actually at risk, petitioner could not be found to have failed to mitigate a risk to her child by failing to comply with the Department for Children and Families' recommendations. In re K.R., 199 Vt. 191, 121 A.3d 1207 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the statutory scheme has changed since 1993, the burden remains with the Department for Children and Families (DCF) to justify its substantiation decision in the fair hearing before the Human Services Board. It remains true, therefore, that DCF's substantiation determinations are significantly different in nature from those of an adjudicative body. In re R.H., 189 Vt. 15, 14 A.3d 267 (2010).

        Human Services Board's statutory authority to hold a fair hearing has not changed, and the Board remains empowered to engage in de novo review. These powers would be meaningless if the Board were limited to determining only whether the Department for Children and Families (DCF) had sufficient evidence to support its conclusions; where the Legislature intended that the Board's review of DCF's decisions be limited, moreover, it has stated so explicitly.

       <p>
        Good cause standard for untimely appeals from placement on the Child Protection Registry to the Human Services Board is applied when determining whether the offender at issue had a valid reason for failing to meet the appeals deadline; in other words, it does not pertain to the substance of the underlying case but rather to the reasons why the offender did not meet the appeals deadline. In re M.S., 205 Vt. 204, 172 A.3d 786 (July 21, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner, who sought to challenge his placement on the Child Protection Registry, did not show good cause for not timely appealing the substantiation of child abuse to the Human Services Board, as petitioner's failure to timely appeal was due to factors entirely within his control.

        Although the statute governing Human Services Board hearings designates the family court's adjudication "competent evidence" in a substantiation proceeding, it does nothing to circumvent the clear requirement in the statute governing records in juvenile judicial proceedings that the Board receive that evidence only when its release has been authorized by a designation order from the family court. In re Appeal of H.H., - Vt.
    - , 251 A.3d 560 (Dec. 31, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Need-to-know designation from the family court in a child-in-need-of-care-or-supervision (CHINS) proceeding was required before the Human Services Board in a substantiation proceeding could inspect the contents of the juvenile files in question. Thus, because this essential step had been bypassed, the facts stipulated to in the CHINS proceeding were not properly considered by the Board in granting summary judgment based on collateral estoppel.

        In reversing a decision including a mother in the child protection registry on the ground that there had been a risk of harm to the child but that no purpose would be served by placing the mother's name in the registry, the Human Services Board failed to follow the plain language of the statute. It had no discretion to conflate the two distinct statutory procedures of substantiation and expungement, and it erred in considering whether the mother was likely to commit similar acts of negligence in the future. In re R.H., 189 Vt. 15, 14 A.3d 267 (2010).

          1. Prosecution of adults for crimes committed when juvenile.
         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         Legislative policy expressly seeks to rehabilitate juvenile offenders while removing the taint of criminality and the consequences of criminal behavior. That policy necessarily takes into account that a child who commits an offense between the ages of ten and 14 is still a child and that his or her culpability must be viewed in light of his or her age; thus, the policy is not furthered by automatically subjecting to criminal prosecution adult defendants who committed delinquent acts when they were children under the age of fourteen.

         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         The freedom of children and parents to relate to one another in the context of the family, free of governmental interference, is a basic liberty long established in constitutional law, thus in order to insure that this fundamental liberty will not be unduly tampered with the Legislature has expressly provide that a child be separated from its parents only when necessary for his welfare or in the interests of public safety.

          2. Welfare of child.
         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         When a juvenile defendant charged with the second-degree murder of a man who came to his home to have sex with his mentally ill mother sought transfer of his case to juvenile court, his case had to be considered in the context of defendant's increasing frustration at his inability to control the escalating events at home - events of the most humiliating and degrading nature for a child. That these events might have combined to overwhelm his youthful judgment was to inform the district court's discretion in light of the special status accorded juvenile cases by the Legislature. Chase v. State, 184 Vt. 430, 966 A.2d 139 (2008).
        </p>
        <p>
         Ability of the public to follow a case through the judicial system was not a proper consideration in denying defendant's motion to transfer his case to juvenile court, and was not entitled to independent weight as a matter of law. A primary purpose of the juvenile court system is to protect juveniles from the taint of criminality that inevitably results from the publicity and permanence of convictions in the district court; the other provisions of the chapter regarding judicial proceedings in juvenile cases, including the discretionary transfer provisions, are to be construed to give effect to the purposes announced for the chapter. State v. Dixon, 185 Vt. 92, 967 A.2d 1114 (2008).
        </p>
        <p>
         Primary concern of court construing this section must be with the welfare of the child. In re R.B., 152 Vt. 415, 566 A.2d 1310 (1989), cert. denied, Appleby v. Young, 493 U.S. 1086, 110 S. Ct. 1151, 107 L. Ed. 2d 1055 (1990).
        </p>
        <p>
         Laws adopted by state for protection, care, custody, and support of children are designed to establish protective procedures, primarily concerned with welfare of the child. In re N.H., 135 Vt. 230, 373 A.2d 851 (1977).
        </p>
        <p>
         Juvenile proceedings in Vermont are protective proceedings entirely concerned with the welfare of the child, and are not punitive; the inquiry relates to proper custody for the child, not his guilt or innocence as a criminal offender. In re Rich, 125 Vt. 373, 216 A.2d 266 (1965).

         Juvenile court is not free to weigh and compare the merits of various possible solutions free of any regard for compelling parental rights. In re N.H., 135 Vt. 230, 373 A.2d 851 (1977); In re H.A., 148 Vt. 106, 528 A.2d 756 (1987).

         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         Provision of this section that a child be separated from its parents only when necessary for his welfare or in the interests of public safety does not allow for intervention simply because a child might be better off somewhere else. In re N.H., 135 Vt. 230, 373 A.2d 851 (1977).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where child who had been abused by mother was in need of care or supervision, and father, despite existence of questions concerning his ability to assume active, responsible parental role, stood willing and able, with support of his parents, to provide child with a family environment, disposition order transferring custody to the Department would be vacated in absence of any convincing proof that father was an unfit parent, demonstrably incapable of providing appropriate home for child.

          6. Termination of parental rights.
         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         Parental rights cannot be terminated simply because a child may be better off in another home. In re E.B., 158 Vt. 8, 603 A.2d 373 (1992).
        </p>
        <p>
         There is a legislative policy of permitting adoption without parental consent only when the best interests of the child cannot be achieved by temporary removal and placement outside the home, and that total termination of parental rights will not be ordered in the first instance if there is a reasonable possibility that the situation can be remedied and the family reunited within a reasonable time. In re D.R., 136 Vt. 478, 392 A.2d 951 (1978).
        </p>
        <p>
         Though juvenile court has the power to sever all parental rights upon a finding that a minor is in need of care or supervision, such power should be used with extreme care and only as a last resort in carrying out the legislative purpose of providing for the care, protection. and wholesome development of children, and this purpose is to be achieved, when possible, in a family environment, with separation of child and parents only when necessary for the child's welfare or in the interests of public safety. In re D.R., 136 Vt. 478, 392 A.2d 951 (1978).
        </p>
        <p>
         Order completely severing all parental rights and allowing adoption of six-year-old girl would be vacated where it was entered after initial finding of inability of parents to properly care for the child without leaving open the possibility in the future that the situation could be remedied and the family reunited.

         State owed plaintiffs no duty of care based on failure to control actions of juvenile who was in State custody but who had been temporarily placed with his mother during weekend of assault, since imposing negligence against State would erode public policy of rehabilitation of juveniles through reunification with their families and the public.

        The General Assembly finds and declares as public policy that an effective juvenile justice system protects public safety; connects youths and young adults to age-appropriate services that reduce the risk of reoffense; and, when appropriate, shields youths from the adverse impact of a criminal record.
       </li>
       <li id="t33p04c51s5101aol1b">
        In order to accomplish these goals, the system should be based on the implementation of data-driven evidence-based practices that offer a broad range of alternatives, such that the degree of intervention is commensurate with the risk of reoffense.
       </li>
       <li id="t33p04c51s5101aol1c">
        High-intensity interventions with low-risk offenders not only decrease program effectiveness, but are contrary to the goal of public safety in that they increase the risk of recidivism. An effective youth justice system includes pre-charge options that keep low-risk offenders out of the criminal justice system altogether.

          1. Child in need of care or supervision.
         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         Mother's husband had the authority to enter a stipulation that the child was a child in need of care and supervision, as he was the child's custodian at that time as well as the presumptive legal parent by virtue of his marriage to the mother at the time of the child's birth; furthermore, it was not necessary for the mother to join the stipulation, as she was a noncustodial parent because she was incarcerated at the time and did not have the right or responsibility over the child's routine daily care or control. In re M.P., 211 Vt. 20, 219 A.3d 1315 (2019).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court properly found that the oldest child was a child in need of care or supervision due to educational neglect in light of the child's excessive absences, her performance below academic standards, and the mother's lack of engagement to rectify these issues. In re B.B., 209 Vt. 528, 208 A.3d 244 (2019).
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence was insufficient to demonstrate that the two younger children were in need of care or supervision due to educational neglect, as they were not required to attend school at their age and the mother could discontinue the services related to their Individualized Education Plans without any presumption of neglect. In re B.B., 209 Vt. 528, 208 A.3d 244 (2019).
        </p>
        <p>
         Child with significant mental illness who cannot be safely cared for by a parent in the home is not a child in need of care or supervision due to being "without or beyond the control of...her parent, guardian, or custodian" if the parent has effectively exercised parental authority to ensure that the child's care is properly managed in another setting. In re M.L., 207 Vt. 128, 186 A.3d 618 (2018).
        </p>
        <p>
         When a mother who could not care for her child in her home due to the daughter's mental health issues had arranged for the child to be placed in a residential facility under the care of mental health professionals, and was looking for a long-term residential placement for her, the trial court erred in finding that the child was a child in need of care or supervision due to being beyond a parent's control. In re M.L., 207 Vt. 128, 186 A.3d 618 (2018).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court properly found that a child was a child in need of care or supervision (CHINS) based on abandonment due to the mother's unwillingness to care for the child, because at the time the CHINS petition was filed, the mother had not been exercising any parental responsibilities for at least a year in that she only sporadically visited the child and had voluntarily abdicated all responsibility for his life, including his schooling and medical needs, to his grandparents. In re B.G., 203 Vt. 317, 155 A.3d 179 (2016).
        </p>
        <p>
         There was sufficient evidence to support the determination that parents' child was a child in need of care or supervision, based on evidence that the mother would not sufficiently protect the child from the father if the child was returned to her care, despite her belief that he was dangerous to the child based on specific, factual circumstances she allegedly observed. In re J.W., 201 Vt. 123, 150 A.3d 190 (2016).
        </p>
        <p>
         While the trial court's specific findings as to the two children who were found to be children in need of care or supervision (CHINS) were indeed truncated, and its analysis would have been far stronger if it had cited the facts in its ruling to support its ultimate conclusion that the children were CHINS, the decision provided a minimally sufficient basis to understand its reasoning, and to support its conclusion that the children were in need of care or supervision. In re J.C., 201 Vt. 192, 138 A.3d 830 (2016).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court's findings in adjudicating two children to be children in need of care or supervision that their mother singled out a third child, her stepchild, for disparate treatment and was observed to treat the stepchild differently than the other children did not betray a logical inconsistency with its subsequent conclusion that her behavior posed a risk to the other children. The risk to the two children was plainly predicated on the agitated and unstable environment in which the stepchild's abuse occurred; finding that the mother singled out the stepchild for particular abuse was not inconsistent with that determination. In re J.C., 201 Vt. 192, 138 A.3d 830 (2016).
        </p>
        <p>
         In adjudicating two children to be children in need of care or supervision, the trial court did not rely solely on the mother's treatment of her stepchild in concluding that the other two children were at risk, as the mother's cruelty occurred in circumstances where all three children were present and where, according to several disinterested witnesses, she exhibited a high level of stress and agitation which manifested itself in a least one instance of physical aggression toward one of the two children that caused concern and comment by the family's social worker. This was sufficient to support the trial court's conclusion that the mother's general conduct endangered the health and welfare of the two children. In re J.C., 201 Vt. 192, 138 A.3d 830 (2016).
        </p>
        <p>
         In a child-in-need-of-care-or-supervision proceeding, none of the alleged factual errors identified by the mother were significant and none warranted reversal. Even if the trial court incorrectly believed that a five- or six- pound newborn was "underweight," it was not a significant finding in light of other evidence of the condition of the newborn, who had to be weaned off drugs because the mother used drugs while pregnant; the trial court's statement that the mother became pregnant "because" she was using drugs appeared to be a simple misstatement; and even if it was not completely accurate to say that the mother was not in treatment from the late fall of 2013 to May 2014, her participation was inconsistent, at best, and she continued to use street drugs. In re M.M., 200 Vt. 540, 133 A.3d 379 (2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err in concluding that an infant was a child in need of care or supervision when the mother was kicked out of drug treatment, accessed buprenorphine off the street, and did not return to treatment until shortly before the birth of the infant, who was born addicted to opioids. In re M.M., 200 Vt. 540, 133 A.3d 379 (2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         In a child-in-need-of-care-or-supervision proceeding, it was reasonable for the trial court to consider that a person who could operate a car with a blood alcohol content of almost twice the legal limit might have an "unhealthy tolerance for alcohol." Even if this were not a reasonable assumption, the error was harmless, as it was undisputed that the mother was driving while significantly impaired with her minor daughter unrestrained in the backseat. In re M.M., 200 Vt. 540, 133 A.3d 379 (2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court's findings concerning an older child were not too far removed from the date the child-in-need-of-care-or-supervision petition was filed to prove that the child was without proper parental care necessary for her well-being, as the mother had been on and off buprenorphine for nine years, was using this drug off the street while pregnant, was in and out of treatment for her opioid addiction, neglected the older child's dental needs to the point where the agency threatened to intervene, drove with the older child unrestrained twice, and pleaded guilty to driving while intoxicated shortly before the petition was filed. In re M.M., 200 Vt. 540, 133 A.3d 379 (2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not construe the child-in-need-of-care-or-supervision statute too broadly; rather, it applied the plain language of the statute and appropriately assessed whether the children were without proper parental care necessary for their well-being. That the mother disagreed with the trial court's conclusion did not render its decision unconstitutional. In re M.M., 200 Vt. 540, 133 A.3d 379 (2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court properly found that a child was a child in need of care or supervision, as the mother's inability to feed a baby or perform other necessary tasks without around-the-clock assistance from others was sufficient to show that the child was at risk of harm, the trial court made its determination not from inchoate concerns but on the basis of eyewitness testimony describing the mother's demonstrated limitations in safely parenting the child, and the trial court did not base its determination upon any presumptions arising from the mother's cognitive limitations. In re M.O., 200 Vt. 384, 131 A.3d 738 (2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         Child was properly adjudicated as a child in need of supervision based on the mother's admission that her substance abuse had an impact on the child, which was made in the context of stipulating to a concession that her behavior of long-term substance abuse and her failure to access and engage in services to address her use rendered the child without proper parental care necessary for his well-being. In re B.R., 196 Vt. 304, 97 A.3d 867 (2014).
        </p>
        <p>
         Facts found by the trial court - the father's long-standing and continued drug addiction, his lack of stable housing, and his failure to follow though with recommendations - were sufficient to support its conclusion that the child was a child in need of care or supervision. The State did not need to establish actual harm. In re L.M., 195 Vt. 637, 93 A.3d 553 (Feb. 14, 2014).
        </p>
        <p>
         There was no merit to a father's argument that his child could not be a child in need of care or supervision because she was living with her grandmother at the time the petition was filed. The father's last-minute placement of the child with his mother did not change his chronic drug addiction, chronic homelessness, and his failure to follow through with recommendations. In re L.M., 195 Vt. 637, 93 A.3d 553 (Feb. 14, 2014).
        </p>
        <p>
         Although many of the trial court's written findings were insufficiently supported, the remaining findings were sufficient to support the trial court's conclusion that the child was a child in need of care or supervision based on medical neglect when the child had a serious kidney disorder, for which he needed monitoring and regular shots. The parents had missed several important appointments, and a visiting nurse testified that at least twice she was unable to administer the child's weekly shot. In re D.D., 194 Vt. 508, 82 A.3d 1143 (2013).
        </p>
        <p>
         Findings that a child's allegations of abuse by the father were the product of the mother's coaching, that this had caused psychological harm to the child, and that this posed a continuing risk of harm were sufficient to support the judgment that the child was a child in need of care or supervision. In re M.A., 193 Vt. 665 (mem.), 60 A.3d 732 (2012).
        </p>
        <p>
         Court was not persuaded that the court held the State to a heightened standard of proof in a child-in-need-of-care-or-supervision (CHINS) proceeding when the case turned on the trial court's assessment of the weight of the evidence. While the State may have satisfied its prima facie burden, the family court was ultimately not persuaded by its evidence; in other words, although there was evidence tending to support the State's position, the court reasoned that such evidence, in its judgment, did not preponderate, and so, in a legal sense, it was unable to find that the children were CHINS. In re M.L. & Z.L., 187 Vt. 291, 993 A.2d 400 (2010).
        </p>
        <p>
         In a child-in-need-of-care-or-supervision case, the State failed to show that the trial court committed reversible error by citing certain medical articles, the thrust of the trial court's statements about which was that there were exceptions or possible explanations for certain injuries similar to those suffered by the child. The trial court found the State's medical case more probable than parents' theories, despite its observations about these articles. In re M.L. & Z.L., 187 Vt. 291, 993 A.2d 400 (2010).

        </h5>
        <p>
         Juvenile proceedings act generally defines "child" to include "an individual who has been alleged to have committed or has committed an act of delinquency after becoming 10 years of age and prior to becoming 18 years of age." Hence, whether an individual is deemed to be a child subject to the jurisdiction of the Family Division depends on the offender's age at the time the delinquent act was committed, not at the time that the offender was charged with the delinquent act. In re D.K., 191 Vt. 328, 47 A.3d 347 (2012).

         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         "Without justification" is an element of a child-in-need-of-care-and-supervision determination based on truancy which the State must prove by a preponderance of the evidence. The State may meet this burden through properly admitted school records showing the child's unexcused absence. In re J.H., 193 Vt. 541, 70 A.3d 1054 (2013).
        </p>
        <p>
         Record evidence was fundamentally insufficient to establish that a minor, who was adjudicated a child in need of care and supervision based on truancy, was truant on the days alleged. The State called no witnesses from the minor's school to testify as to its policies and procedures governing whether, when, and how it reported a student truant, and adduced no school records to show that the minor was actually absent without justification on the days in question. In re J.H., 193 Vt. 541, 70 A.3d 1054 (2013).

        </h5>
        <p>
         In a child in need of care or supervision case, the trial court did not err in finding that a mother's actions constituted abuse when it found, based on a video and testimony, that the mother tossed the five-year-old child like a rag doll onto a gravel driveway, threw a toy at his feet as hard as she could, and then kicked at his face, and the fact that the child appeared happy later that day did not demonstrate that no abuse occurred.

        </h5>
        <p>
         Family Division's findings as to the parents' drug use in a child in need of care or supervision (CHINS) proceeding were not clearly erroneous, as the family court had the discretion to give minimal weight to the child's hearsay statements about what the parents did with plastic bags, to weigh the conflicting testimony and to find the parents to be credible regarding their recent history with drugs, and to not draw an inference against the parents based on circumstantial evidence; a single instance of heroin use by the mother a week prior to the caseworker's visit was minimally probative of the child's status as CHINS at the time the petition was filed. In re M.E., 211 Vt. 320, 225 A.3d 633 (2019).
        </p>
        <p>
         Evidence did not support the finding that a child was a child in need of care or supervision (CHINS). The mother's admitted single use of benzodiazepines when the child was being cared for by others was minimally probative of the child's status two weeks later; the mother's appearing "off" on one occasion, and slow and forgetful on another, did not support a finding of CHINS absent a finding that the mother was impaired on those occasions; and findings from a prior CHINS decision concerning the mother's failure to protect one of her daughters from being exposed to domestic abuse were insufficient to support the present CHINS petition in the absence of evidence supporting the inference that she was continuing to expose her child to such risks. In re B.C., 209 Vt. 48, 203 A.3d 515 (2018).
        </p>
        <p>
         Even if a trial court erred in taking judicial notice of a father's extensive criminal history in a child in need of care or supervision proceeding, any such error was harmless because it was clear that he had a criminal history and it was not significantly relied upon in the trial court's decision except to corroborate the mother's allegations concerning his behavior.

         When the paternal grandmother sought to appear in the juvenile proceeding through an attorney after the termination petition was filed and requested visitation, the trial court properly declined to enter her as a party and denied the request for visitation.

        <p>
         As the family court plainly had jurisdiction over the category of case and was explicitly authorized to approve a written stipulation to the merits of the petition, even if it improperly adjudicated a child as a child in need of care or supervision based on the mother's stipulation alone, the judgment was not void for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. For the same reason, the parents' argument that the adjudication was not supported by sufficient evidence because it was based on pre-birth circumstances was insufficient to render the judgment void. In re C.L.S., 211 Vt. 344, 225 A.3d 644 (2020).
        </p>
        <p>
         Child-in-need-of-care-or-supervision (CHINS) merits decision was final and not void pursuant to a belated collateral attack. The family court had jurisdiction over the child-neglect proceeding and also had the ability to issue a CHINS decision pursuant to Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act emergency jurisdiction; thus, even if the exercise of emergency jurisdiction was "ill-advised," in the context of this collateral attack, the underlying order was not void as a matter of law on subject-matter-jurisdiction grounds. In re C.P., 193 Vt. 29, 71 A.3d 1142 (2012).
        </p>
        <p>
         Statutory scheme in place when defendant was charged in 2010 for crimes he allegedly committed when he was a juvenile provided the Family Division with exclusive original jurisdiction to adjudicate charges alleging delinquent acts committed by defendants 14 years of age. The Family Division's jurisdiction over juvenile delinquency proceedings is exclusive and takes precedence over any inconsistent criminal law provisions, but normally ends when the juvenile reaches 18 years of age. In re D.K., 191 Vt. 328, 47 A.3d 347 (2012).
        </p>
        <p>
         When defendant, an adult, was charged with offenses alleged to have occurred when he was a juvenile between the ages of ten and 14 years, the Family Division's exclusive original jurisdiction terminated upon defendant having reached 18 years of age, and the Family Division properly dismissed the State's delinquency petition for lack of subject matter jurisdiction. There was no support for the State's position that even assuming the Family Division properly dismissed the delinquency petition under the applicable law, the criminal division retained jurisdiction in this case by virtue of its general jurisdiction over criminal offenses such as sexual assault. In re D.K., 191 Vt. 328, 47 A.3d 347 (2012).

         Trial court erred in failing to order genetic testing of a father following the initial hearing on the child-in-need-of-care-or-supervision (CHINS) petition when the mother and the father had three prior children together, they were living together prior to the child's birth, and the father was named in the CHINS petition and appeared at the initial hearing. The error did not require reversal, however, as the father was not prejudiced in that the merits hearing properly focused on the child and the trial court explained at the end of the second day of the merits hearing that the father would have an opportunity to challenge any evidence presented at the merits hearing that was going to be used at disposition.

         In its post-disposition decision to modify the plan to transfer legal custody of a child back to the Department for Children and Families, the trial court applied the proper standard of proof, preponderance of the evidence. In re I.B., 202 Vt. 311, 149 A.3d 160 (2016).

        <p>
         Trial court's error in employing a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, rather than a clear-and-convincing evidence standard, to determine whether the mother had stagnated in her ability to care for the children could not be considered harmless. Given the close balancing that the trial court engaged in and its explicit determination of the issue by an impermissibly low standard of proof, the appellate court could not conclude that as a matter of law the trial court's conclusion would have been the same under a clear-and-convincing-evidence standard.

         Trial court's findings that the level of stress, substance abuse, and domestic violence within the home had escalated since the child's return was sufficient to show a material change in circumstances, and its finding that the escalating turmoil posed a real risk to the child's physical and emotional well-being was sufficient to support its conclusion that a post-disposition transfer of custody to the Department for Children and Families was in the child's best interest. In re I.B., 202 Vt. 311, 149 A.3d 160 (2016).

        <p>
         Reading the statutory language in light of the legislative purpose to provide timely permanency to children and taking into account the unique nature of a termination order, the Vermont Supreme Court concludes that the statute allowing modification of juvenile orders based on changed circumstances does not apply to an order terminating parental rights. It would indefinitely expand the termination process and abolish the intended permanency of a termination-of-parental-rights order if a parent could seek to modify the order based on changed circumstances. In re A.W., 195 Vt. 226, 87 A.3d 508 (2013).
        </p>
        <p>
         Because an order terminating a father's parental rights was not subject to the father's motion to modify based on changed circumstances, the trial court properly dismissed the motion. In re A.W., 195 Vt. 226, 87 A.3d 508 (2013).
        </p>
        <p>
         Assuming in a termination of parental rights case that the family court was required to find a change of circumstances, any error on the family court's part in not doing so was harmless because the father's relinquishment of his parental rights and the custodial grandmother's death established changed circumstances by clear and convincing evidence. In re D.C., 193 Vt. 101, 71 A.3d 1191 (2012).
        </p>
        <p>
         Family court is allowed to modify previous orders on the grounds that a change in circumstances requires such action to serve the best interests of the child. Thus, the threshold statutory requirement is found in the broader term "change of circumstances" rather than the more specific term "stagnation." In re D.C., 193 Vt. 101, 71 A.3d 1191 (2012).
        </p>
        <p>
         Parental stagnation is but one way to show changed circumstances. To be sure, the threshold changed-circumstances requirement is most often met by showing stagnation in a parent's ability to care for a child, but the statutory standard is changed circumstances, not stagnation, and stagnation is not the only way to show changed circumstances. In re D.C., 193 Vt. 101, 71 A.3d 1191 (2012).
        </p>
        <p>
         Stagnation cannot result solely from the actions of third parties, but that does not mean that other types of changed circumstances cannot arise independent of the subject parent's actions. In re D.C., 193 Vt. 101, 71 A.3d 1191 (2012).

        <p>
         Court does not read the various avenues for review of the circumstances and expectations of the parents and children to create independent opportunities to modify a disposition order in a child-in-need-of-care-or-supervision case without a showing of changed circumstances. Instead they reflect that circumstances must change within relatively short periods of time to reflect the goals of the case plan and achieve permanency for the children; thus, one result of a permanency hearing is to produce an estimate of when the permanency goal will be achieved.

         Because a motion by the Department for Children and Families (DCF) to retransfer custody to DCF was essentially a motion to modify the disposition plan, the trial court's order granting the motion, though erroneously styled as a temporary care order, was procedurally an order modifying the custodial aspects of the court's prior disposition order and as such was an appealable final order.

         In terminating a mother's parental rights, the trial court properly found that her ability to care for the children had stagnated, as any misstatement about the mother's prompt engagement in substance abuse treatment was harmless given her relapses, the trial court properly characterized her recovery as in the early stages, the mother, not the agency, was responsible for her failure to engage in parent-child contact, and even if the mother's upcoming surgery was irrelevant, the trial court's decision did not turn on this finding.

        </p>
        <p>
         It was error to terminate the parental rights of the child's biological father. While there was a change of circumstances arising from the identification of the father, who had previously acted as a caretaker for the child, as a legal parent not previously identified or recognized in the approved case plan adopted in the disposition order, the family court based its conclusion that termination was in the child's best interests on its finding of stagnation, which was inapplicable in the absence of a disposition order that included a case plan that the father had to follow.

         Vermont provides representation in the proceeding following a petition in juvenile court including any subsequent proceedings arising from an order therein. and the statutes on juvenile proceedings specifically provide that an order of the court may be set aside in accordance with Rule 60. In enacting the statutory scheme for juvenile proceedings, the Legislature specifically contemplated that a Rule 60 motion is a "subsequent proceeding" that may arise; therefore, parents who had voluntarily relinquished their parental rights were entitled to assigned counsel for purposes of their Rule 60(b) motion seeking to reopen the termination of parental rights decision. In re M.T., 206 Vt. 80, 179 A.3d 754 (Nov. 3, 2017).

         Statute allowing modification or vacation of orders in juvenile proceedings does not apply to an order terminating parental rights. Thus, a mother who had voluntarily relinquished her parental rights after entering into a postadoption-contact agreement with the child's grandmother was not entitled under the statute to vacate the termination order after the agency removed the child from the grandmother's home and placed her with another pre-adoptive foster family.

         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         In a termination of parental rights case, the trial court did not impermissibly shift the burden of proof with respect to the child's adjustment to his home, school, and community; viewed in context, the trial court was not requiring the father to show that the child would adjust well to his home, but was refuting the argument that the child's complete failure to adjust to alternative community placements somehow supported a placement with the father or militated against termination. The evidence that the child required even more structure, discipline, and counseling than trained therapeutic foster parents were able to provide did not support a placement with the father, whom the evidence showed to be largely incapable of understanding or attending to his extensive needs. In re B.C., 194 Vt. 391, 81 A.3d 1152 (2013).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court's error in employing a preponderance-of-the-evidence standard, rather than a clear-and-convincing evidence standard, to determine whether the mother had stagnated in her ability to care for the children could not be considered harmless. Given the close balancing that the trial court engaged in and its explicit determination of the issue by an impermissibly low standard of proof, the appellate court could not conclude that as a matter of law the trial court's conclusion would have been the same under a clear-and-convincing-evidence standard. In re R.W., 191 Vt. 108, 39 A.3d 682 (2011).

         In a termination of parental rights case, the family court properly found that the mother was unfit. It did not terminate her rights because she was poor; rather, it found that she was not taking medications to address her mental-health issues, had no idea where she would be living month to month, acknowledged not knowing what the child's needs were, did not recognize the significance of the child's developmental delays, and had not taken any steps to be in a position to parent the child.

        </h5>
        <p>
         In a termination of parental rights case, the trial court properly found that the parents would not be able to parent the children within a reasonable time, as the evidence, including the parents' inability to maintain a home free of filth and to learn from parenting coaching, supported the finding of lack of progress and of stagnation. Furthermore, the trial court was not required to expressly consider the opinions of the guardians ad litem in reaching its decision. In re H.T., 211 Vt. 476, 227 A.3d 504 (2020), cert denied, S.T. v. VT Dep't for Children and Families, 2020 U.S. LEXIS 4397, - U.S.
    - , 141 S. Ct. 418, 208 L. Ed. 2d 121 (U.S. 2020).
        </p>
        <p>
         It was error to terminate the parental rights of the child's biological father. While there was a change of circumstances arising from the identification of the father, who had previously acted as a caretaker for the child, as a legal parent not previously identified or recognized in the approved case plan adopted in the disposition order, the family court based its conclusion that termination was in the child's best interests on its finding of stagnation, which was inapplicable in the absence of a disposition order that included a case plan that the father had to follow. In re M.P., 211 Vt. 20, 219 A.3d 1315 (2019).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court properly terminated a mother's parental rights, as it did not focus on her incarceration per se, but on its impact on her ability to resume parenting within a reasonable time, and it duly weighed the statutory best-interests criteria and determined by clear and convincing evidence that the mother could not resume her parental duties within a reasonable period of time and that whatever bond she had with the child did not overcome other criteria compelling termination of her parental rights. In re N.L., 209 Vt. 450, 207 A.3d 475 (2019).
        </p>
        <p>
         In a termination of parental rights proceeding, the Family Division made inadequate findings on the best interests of the child with respect to the father, most particularly regarding whether he would be able to resume his parental duties within a reasonable period of time from the child's perspective. It did not discuss or evaluate father's failure to seek contact with the child, notwithstanding the undisputed evidence that he made no effort to contact the Department for Children and Families or seek contact with the child from the time she was taken into State custody in August 2017 until the termination petition was filed in January 2018. In re N.L., 209 Vt. 450, 207 A.3d 475 (2019).
        </p>
        <p>
         Statutory best-interests factors compelled termination of a father's parental rights when the father had never played a constructive role in the child's life, made no effort to establish visits with her for a critical period of several months after she was taken into State custody, was responsible for the lengthy delay in establishing any contact, and would not be able to resume any parenting role within a reasonable period of time from the child's perspective, considering her age, the length of time she had spent in State custody, and her need for permanency. In re N.L., 209 Vt. 450, 207 A.3d 475 (2019).
        </p>
        <p>
         For purposes of the statutory best-interests analysis in a termination of parental rights case, the record did not support the mother's contention that she had a significant or constructive relationship with the children, as the mother had not progressed beyond supervised weekly visits, the foster families had been the people who had met the children's substantial needs, and while the mother had made some progress, she still struggled with her parenting skills. In re N.C. & A.F., 204 Vt. 658, 159 A.3d 1098 (Apr. 24, 2017).

        <p>
         In a termination of parental rights case, it was appropriate for the family court, irrespective of the fact that the criminal charges against the father were still pending, to consider his pretrial incarceration and its consequences in evaluating what course of action was in the child's best interests. In re M.W., 201 Vt. 622, 145 A.3d 1250 (2016).
        </p>
        <p>
         Family court properly terminated a father's parental rights when it found that the father was never the child's primary caregiver; the father was incarcerated and was now unknown to the child; the father had been incarcerated for nearly two years, during which period the child had endured trauma and had since developed a significant bond with his maternal grandparents; the child was a fragile child in dire need of stability and permanence; the length of the father's pretrial incarceration was uncertain; and even if the father was ultimately not convicted of the multiple crimes with which he had been charged, it would require a significant period of time for him to become part of the child's life. In re M.W., 201 Vt. 622, 145 A.3d 1250 (2016).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err in terminating a father's parental rights. It concluded that it would be impossible for the father to care for the mother, protect the children, meet everyone's needs, including his own, and support the family, and that the father could not care for the children on his own even if he chose to live apart from the mother; while the trial court recognized that a relative had played some role in the father's lack of contact with the children, it found the father responsible for the lack of contact as well. In re R.B., 200 Vt. 45, 126 A.3d 496 (2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err in terminating a mother's parental rights due to the child's need for permanency while at the same time not terminating the father's, as it terminated the mother's rights for multiple reasons, only one of which was the child's need for permanency, and it found that unlike the mother, the father would most likely be able to resume his parental duties within a reasonable period of time, given his relatively short history of drug use and his demonstrated commitment to overcoming his addiction and caring for his son. Furthermore, speculation over whether the father might move back in with the mother was not a sufficient basis to reverse the Family Division's termination order with respect to the mother. In re C.F., 198 Vt. 504, 117 A.3d 819 (2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         In a termination of parental rights case, the evidence supported the trial court's critical conclusion that the father would not be able to resume parental responsibilities within a reasonable period of time; the trial court expressly found that in light of the overwhelming evidence of the child's extreme trauma and the need for trained care providers to provide a safe and stable environment, neither the father nor the child's paternal grandparents could provide for the child's highly specialized needs. The father also overlooked the fundamental requirement that a reasonable time had to be measured from the viewpoint of the child's needs, and the substantial evidence attesting to the child's critical need for permanence immediately, while he was still relatively young. In re B.C., 194 Vt. 391, 81 A.3d 1152 (2013).
        </p>
        <p>
         In a termination of parental rights case, the trial court did not err in finding that the father had not played a significant role in the child's life. The evidence supported the finding that the father's role in caring for the child was limited, and the trial court did not give the long suspension of visitation substantial weight in its ruling, which was based fundamentally on the inability of the father or his extended family to understand or address the child's extensive needs now or in the future, and thus his inability to resume parental responsibilities within a reasonable time. In re B.C., 194 Vt. 391, 81 A.3d 1152 (2013).
        </p>
        <p>
         Despite the mother's progress in meeting her personal goals, termination of her parental rights was in the child's best interests. The mother had little capacity to adapt her care to the child's needs, the residence where mother and father reside was not a suitable place for the child, neither parent was capable of living independently of their communal living situation, the child suffered developmental delays while living with his parents, the mother and the child did not share a close bond, and the child would suffer lasting damage if reunification were attempted and unsuccessful.

         In a termination of parental rights case, the level of assistance provided to parents is relevant in determining whether a parent is unlikely to be able to resume parental duties within a reasonable period of time. But whether the Department for Children and Families made reasonable efforts to achieve permanency is a separate question from whether termination is in the child's best interests, and the former is not a prerequisite to the latter.

        <p>
         Statute governing protective orders in juvenile proceedings generally permits the Superior Court to issue protective orders upon a showing that the conduct of a person is or may be detrimental or harmful to a child. Approving a postadoption-contact agreement based, in part, on a finding that the agreement will serve the child's best interests is not the same as finding that the child will be harmed if the agreement is not fulfilled.

         When a mother who had voluntarily relinquished her parental rights after entering into a postadoption-contact agreement with the child's grandmother sought a protective order after the agency removed the child from the grandmother's home and placed her with another pre-adoptive foster family, permitting a protective order would be directly inconsistent with the Legislature's more specific and recent recognition that although a postadoption-contact agreement could not be approved unless it served the child's best interests, any parent who was a party to such an agreement had to acknowledge that the termination of that parent's parental rights was final even if the adoption or expected contact did not occur.

         Although the statute governing Human Services Board hearings designates the family court's adjudication "competent evidence" in a substantiation proceeding, it does nothing to circumvent the clear requirement in the statute governing records in juvenile judicial proceedings that the Board receive that evidence only when its release has been authorized by a designation order from the family court. In re Appeal of H.H., - Vt.
    - , 251 A.3d 560 (Dec. 31, 2020).
        </p>
        <p>
         Need-to-know designation from the family court in a child-in-need-of-care-or-supervision (CHINS) proceeding was required before the Human Services Board in a substantiation proceeding could inspect the contents of the juvenile files in question. Thus, because this essential step had been bypassed, the facts stipulated to in the CHINS proceeding were not properly considered by the Board in granting summary judgment based on collateral estoppel. In re Appeal of H.H., - Vt.

         Denial of defendant's motion to seal the record of his 2001 conviction for lewd and lascivious conduct with a child was error, as he committed the crime before he was 21 years old and more than two years had elapsed, but remand was appropriate as the trial court had made no finding as to whether defendant was rehabilitated.

          1. Protective orders.
         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         When a mother who had voluntarily relinquished her parental rights after entering into a postadoption-contact agreement with the child's grandmother sought a protective order after the agency removed the child from the grandmother's home and placed her with another pre-adoptive foster family, permitting a protective order would be directly inconsistent with the Legislature's more specific and recent recognition that although a postadoption-contact agreement could not be approved unless it served the child's best interests, any parent who was a party to such an agreement had to acknowledge that the termination of that parent's parental rights was final even if the adoption or expected contact did not occur. In re P.K., 204 Vt. 102, 164 A.3d 665 (Jan. 6, 2017).

          A petition for reinstatement of parental rights may be filed by the Department for Children and Families on behalf of a child in the custody of the Department under the following conditions:

        Permanency plan.
    
    The Department shall file an updated permanency plan with the petition for reinstatement. The updated plan shall address the material change in circumstances since the termination of parental rights, the Department's efforts to achieve permanency, the reasons for the parent's desire to have rights reinstated, any statements by the child expressing the child's opinions about reinstatement, and the parent's present ability and willingness to resume or assume parental duties.

           <li id="t33p04c51s5125ol1c1A">

The court may order the Department to provide transition services to the family as appropriate. If during this time period the child is removed from the parent's temporary conditional custody due to allegations of abuse or neglect, the court shall dismiss the petition for reinstatement of parental rights if the court finds the allegations have been proven by a preponderance of the evidence.

        Final order.
    
    After the child is placed with the parent for up to six months pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the court shall hold a hearing to determine if the placement has been successful. The court shall enter a final order of reinstatement of parental rights upon a finding by a preponderance of the evidence that placement continues to be in the child's best interests.
       </li>
       <li id="t33p04c51s5125ol1e">
        Effect of reinstatement.
    
    Reinstatement of parental rights does not vacate or otherwise affect the validity of the original order terminating parental rights. Reinstatement restores a parent's legal rights to his or her child, including all rights, powers, privileges, immunities, duties, and obligations that were terminated by the court in the termination of parental rights order. Such reinstatement shall be a recognition that the parent's and child's situations have changed since the time of the termination of parental rights, and reunification is appropriate. An order reinstating the legal parent and child relationship as to one parent of the child has no effect on the legal rights of any other parent whose rights to the child have been terminated by the court; or the legal sibling relationship between the child and any other children of the parent. A parent whose rights are reinstated pursuant to this section is not liable for child support owed to the Department during the period from termination of parental rights to reinstatement.

        Legislature's attempt to clarify the law in 2011 after defendant was charged created an entirely new jurisdictional statute providing procedures for adjudicating delinquency petitions involving adult defendants where none existed before. The new statute was plainly inconsistent with the prior law and could not be considered merely a clarification of what a previous Legislature had intended the statute to mean.

      Prior to the preliminary hearing, the child shall be afforded an opportunity to undergo a risk and needs screening, which shall be conducted by the Department or by a community provider that has contracted with the Department to provide risk and need screenings for children alleged to have committed delinquent acts.
     </p>
     <p>
      (2) If the child participates in such a screening, the Department or the community provider shall report the risk level result of the screening, the number and source of the collateral contacts made, and the recommendation for charging or other alternatives to the State's Attorney. The State's Attorney shall consider the results of the risk and needs screening in determining whether to file a charge. In lieu of filing a charge, the State's Attorney may refer a child directly to a youth-appropriate community-based provider that has been approved by the Department, which may include a community justice center or a balanced and restorative justice program. Referral to a community-based provider pursuant to this subsection shall not require the State's Attorney to file a charge. If the community-based provider does not accept the case or if the child fails to complete the program in a manner deemed satisfactory and timely by the provider, the child's case shall return to the State's Attorney for charging consideration.

If the court diversion program does not accept the case or if the child fails to complete the program in a manner deemed satisfactory and timely by the provider, the child's case shall return to the State's Attorney for charging consideration.

        There was no merit to a mother's argument that evidence was improperly excluded from a delinquency disposition proceeding, as the mother failed to identify hearsay reports that should have been admitted or indicate what they would have shown, and she failed to show how admission of the child's school records would have changed the result. The court's findings were amply supported by the testimony of school personnel and a State detective, and the disposition was based in large part on the improvements the child had made.

       <p>
        With regard to whether the statutory timeline for adjudicating the merits of a delinquency petition concerning a juvenile being held in a secure treatment facility applies to a delinquency petition in which there is no secured-facility placement order because the subject juvenile has already been placed at a secure facility pursuant to a prior, separate delinquency petition, the statutory timeline does not apply in such situations. In re A.A., - Vt.
    - , 236 A.3d 1287 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the statutory timeline for adjudicating the merits of a delinquency petition concerning a juvenile being held in a secure facility is mandatory, the plain meaning of its language indicates that it applies only to the particular delinquency petition before the court. In re A.A., - Vt.
    - , 236 A.3d 1287 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the statutory timeline for adjudicating the merits of a delinquency petition concerning a juvenile being held in a secure facility applied on a case-specific basis, and here defendant juvenile had already been placed at a secure facility pursuant to a prior, separate delinquency petition, the timeline did not apply, and therefore there was no need to dismiss the case. In re A.A., - Vt.

        Delinquency provision requiring an independent, second evidentiary hearing does not apply to the provision which gives the Commissioner of the Department for Children and Families sole authority to place a child in a secure facility in a post-disposition setting. Thus, defendant juvenile, whose case involved a a post-disposition placement decision, was not entitled to a second evidentiary hearing. In re N.M., - Vt.

       <p>
        Trial court did not err in applying to its decision to revoke defendant's youthful offender status the same factors the Legislature provided for granting youthful offender status. State v. Suhr, 207 Vt. 379, 189 A.3d 552 (Apr. 27, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in revoking defendant's youthful offender status, as it had found that he had never been offered adequate sex-offender treatment, which was particularly important given the underlying sex offense, and it was too speculative to find that he would have violated his probation conditions even if he had received appropriate sex-offender therapy.

        Trial court properly found that public safety would not be protected if defendant juvenile were granted youthful-offender status, as it found that defendant, who was charged with aggravated assault and had a history of drug and alcohol abuse, had engaged in a new violent act while under the influence of alcohol, despite being underage and under a condition of release that he not drink alcohol, that the juvenile justice system offered no meaningful accountability mechanism because it was entirely a rehabilitative system without punishment, and that defendant had an unstable residential and employment situation.

        Because neither parent objected to the family court's failure to take evidence or sought to introduce evidence at a temporary care hearing or at any subsequent hearing, there was no basis for their claim that the family court violated their due process rights by improperly failing to hold a contested evidentiary hearing at the temporary care hearing. Furthermore, under the statute governing temporary care hearings, "all parties shall have the right to present evidence," but nothing in the statutory scheme requires it.

        Mother could not now challenge a termination of parental rights order through a belated claim that the Department for Children and Families (DCF) failed to make reasonable efforts to prevent the child's removal from his home. During the lengthy period when the mother played a limited role in the child's life and agreed to other family members assuming custody of the child, she made no progress in reaching a point where she could care for the child. In re D.C., 193 Vt. 101, 71 A.3d 1191 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether the Department for Children and Families made reasonable efforts to prevent a child's removal from his home is a separate question from, and not a prerequisite to, the issue of whether termination of parental rights is warranted under the statutory criteria regarding the best interests of the child.

       <p>
        Child was properly adjudicated as a child in need of supervision based on the mother's admission that her substance abuse had an impact on the child, which was made in the context of stipulating to a concession that her behavior of long-term substance abuse and her failure to access and engage in services to address her use rendered the child without proper parental care necessary for his well-being. In re B.R., 196 Vt. 304, 97 A.3d 867 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Admissible testimony established that a child was living, and continued to live, with his parents in the same household until around the time that the child was in need of care or supervision petition was filed, as the social worker's failure to visit the home during a particular period did not render her testimony inadmissible. In re B.R., 196 Vt. 304, 97 A.3d 867 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Findings that a child's allegations of abuse by the father were the product of the mother's coaching, that this had caused psychological harm to the child, and that this posed a continuing risk of harm were sufficient to support the judgment that the child was a child in need of care or supervision. In re M.A., 193 Vt. 665 (mem.), 60 A.3d 732 (2012).

       <p>
        Merits decision in a child-in-need-of-care-or-supervision proceeding is a final order, and failure to bring an appeal of that order within 30 days bars subsequent challenges to the order. In re D.D., 194 Vt. 508, 82 A.3d 1143 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Given the uncertainty regarding whether a merits decision child-in-need-of-care-or-supervision proceeding had to be appealed immediately or could instead be combined with an appeal of disposition, it would be fundamentally unfair to foreclose a father from appealing the merits decision where important rights were at stake.

        As the family court plainly had jurisdiction over the category of case and was explicitly authorized to approve a written stipulation to the merits of the petition, even if it improperly adjudicated a child as a child in need of care or supervision based on the mother's stipulation alone, the judgment was not void for lack of subject-matter jurisdiction. For the same reason, the parents' argument that the adjudication was not supported by sufficient evidence because it was based on pre-birth circumstances was insufficient to render the judgment void.

       <p>
        In its decision
        In re B.C.,
        the Vermont Supreme Court noted that a termination petition starts a new proceeding if it is not part of the initial disposition process, but to the extent that that language can be taken as a ruling that disposition generally, and termination of parental rights at disposition specifically, does not start a new proceeding, this interpretation is erroneous. In view of the Court's conclusion that a child in need of care or supervision merits adjudication is a final appealable order, disposition is necessarily a separate proceeding, irrespective of whether termination is sought at that time; it is separately defined by statute and requires separate procedures.

         1. Termination of parental rights.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In terminating a father's parental rights, the trial court had properly found the requisite change of circumstances for modifying its earlier order denying the State's termination petition. The evidence here amply supported the finding that the father's ability to care for the child had stagnated; the fact that the child had been receiving love and stability from his stepmother during the same period did not mean that the father's inaction in obtaining counseling had not negatively affected the child. In re J.G., 188 Vt. 562, 2 A.3d 817 (mem.) (2010).

         2. Custody.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Even if it were reasonable to assume that the Legislature intended the courts in post-disposition proceedings to utilize the options set forth in the statute governing children-in-need-of-care-and-supervision disposition orders, nothing in the statutory language suggests that the list of custodial options is exclusive. On the contrary, the statute provides that the court shall make such orders relating to legal custody as are in the best interests of the child, "including" the seven enumerated. In re J.G., 188 Vt. 562, 2 A.3d 817 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute governing children-in-need-of-care-and-supervision disposition orders may address the typical case where a termination of parental rights leaves no custodial option other than the Department for Children and Families, but this is hardly the only possible scenario. As the Legislature's intentional use of the term "including" implies, therefore, the more reasoned and likely purpose of the provision allowing an "order terminating all rights and responsibilities of a parent by transferring legal custody and residual parental rights to the commissioner without limitation as to adoption" was to provide one termination option, but not the only one. In re J.G., 188 Vt. 562, 2 A.3d 817 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not lack authority to terminate a father's parental rights and award custody to a stepmother instead of to the Department for Children and Families. Even if the Legislature intended courts in post-disposition proceedings to use the options in the statute governing children-in-need-of-care-and-supervision disposition orders, nothing suggested that the list of custodial options was exclusive. In re J.G., 188 Vt. 562, 2 A.3d 817 (mem.) (2010).

         3. Appeal.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Because a motion by the Department for Children and Families (DCF) to retransfer custody to DCF was essentially a motion to modify the disposition plan, the trial court's order granting the motion, though erroneously styled as a temporary care order, was procedurally an order modifying the custodial aspects of the court's prior disposition order and as such was an appealable final order. In re I.B., 202 Vt. 311, 149 A.3d 160 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because a disposition order in a child-in-need-of-care-or-supervision case is a "final order," and thus meets the standard for an appealable order, the parties can appeal a disposition order whether original or as a result of modification. Thus, because the order that a mother appealed from was an amended disposition order, the court had jurisdiction over the appeal. In re R.M., 194 Vt. 431, 82 A.3d 565 (2013).

       </h5>
       <p>
        At the disposition stage of a child-in-need-of-care-or-supervision case, the trial court did not err in not allowing the mother to present evidence concerning the grandmother's suitability as a placement, as it had the discretion to decide whether to allow parents to put on new evidence regarding the suitability of a third-party caretaker and had recently taken extensive evidence on the grandmother's suitability.

       </h5>
       <p>
        In a child-in-need-of-care-or-supervision (CHINS) proceeding, the Family Division erred in directing the mother to pay 75 percent of the costs for the child's visits to Vermont, as the CHINS statute did not explicitly authorize the Family Division to allocate the costs of unsupervised parent-child contact between a custodial parent and a noncustodial parent or to allocate travel costs when the Family Division transferred custody to a noncustodial parent at disposition; furthermore, the authority was not inherent in the overall statutory scheme for CHINS proceedings.

       <p>
        Statutory scheme governing permanency proceedings expressly authorizes the suspension of parent-child contact while the child is in Department for Children and Families custody if necessary for the protection of the physical safety or emotional well-being of the child. This provision clearly contemplates a temporary deprivation of rights, and therefore may be satisfied by a preponderance of the evidence showing that a suspension of contact is necessary for the protection of the child's physical or emotional safety. In re B.C., 194 Vt. 391, 81 A.3d 1152 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although in retrospect, the suspension of father's contact with the child led to a permanent termination of his parental rights, at the time the suspension was temporary and did not purport to permanently cut off his parental rights; accordingly, no finding of unfitness was required at that time, and there was no deprivation of father's fundamental rights. Moreover, although the trial court noted the father's extended lack of contact with the child, it did not give this factor substantial weight in its decision terminating his parental rights.

       Upon the filing of a petition for a finding of reasonable efforts and a report or affidavit by the Department for Children and Families with notice to all parties, the court shall hold a hearing within 30 days of the filing of the petition to determine, by a preponderance of the evidence, whether the Department for Children and Families has made reasonable efforts to finalize the permanency plan for the child that is in effect at the time of the hearing. The hearing may be consolidated with or separate from a permanency hearing. Reasonable efforts to finalize a permanency plan may consist of:

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In a child-in-need-of-care-or-supervision case, the trial court did not err in finding six months to be a reasonable period of time to achieve the permanency goal of reunification, given the relatively slow pace of the mother's progress and the children's need for permanency. The time period was simply an estimate, and if the State sought to terminate the mother's rights, the mother was not foreclosed from challenging the time-period as unreasonable in hindsight. In re R.M., 194 Vt. 431, 82 A.3d 565 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a termination of parental rights case, the level of assistance provided to parents is relevant in determining whether a parent is unlikely to be able to resume parental duties within a reasonable period of time. But whether the Department for Children and Families made reasonable efforts to achieve permanency is a separate question from whether termination is in the child's best interests, and the former is not a prerequisite to the latter. In re C.P., 193 Vt. 29, 71 A.3d 1142 (2012).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Court does not read the various avenues for review of the circumstances and expectations of the parents and children to create independent opportunities to modify a disposition order in a child-in-need-of-care-or-supervision case without a showing of changed circumstances. Instead they reflect that circumstances must change within relatively short periods of time to reflect the goals of the case plan and achieve permanency for the children; thus, one result of a permanency hearing is to produce an estimate of when the permanency goal will be achieved. In re R.M., 194 Vt. 431, 82 A.3d 565 (2013).

       <p>
        In a termination of parental rights (TPR) case, the father's challenge to the trial court's "reasonable efforts" determination was moot, because having found that the trial court properly granted the TPR petition, there was no further relief the court could grant to the father by reviewing the standalone reasonable-efforts determination. In re D.F., 209 Vt. 272, 204 A.3d 641 (2018).

      1. Constitutional requirements.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     Although juvenile proceedings are summary, they must not be so summary that they fail to measure up to the minimum essentials of substantive due process. In re Lee, 126 Vt. 156, 224 A.2d 917 (1966).
    </p>
    <p>
     A juvenile proceeding must not be so summary that it fails to measure up to the minimum essentials of substantive due process. In re Rich, 125 Vt. 373, 216 A.2d 266 (1965).
    </p>
    <p>
     A juvenile proceeding may properly dispense with formal constitutional requirements relating to criminal proceedings, the justification being based on the conception of the proceeding as noncriminal and as being an exercise of the parens patriae authority of the State, making it essentially a custody proceeding. In re Rich, 125 Vt. 373, 216 A.2d 266 (1965).
    </p>
    <h5 id="t33p04c55-annotationsfromformerchapter55-2">
     <b>
      2. Construction.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     The goal of furthering the best interests of the children whose future is at stake underlies the governing juvenile proceedings statutory scheme. In re M.B., 158 Vt. 63, 605 A.2d 515 (1992).
    </p>
    <p>
     This chapter was enacted in a valid exercise of the police power, is not penal, but protective, and is to be liberally construed. In re Hook, 95 Vt. 497, 115 A. 730 (1922).
    </p>
    <h5 id="t33p04c55-annotationsfromformerchapter55-3">
     <b>
      3. Construction with other laws.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     The procedural safeguards attendant upon any proceeding under this chapter, including the right to appointment of a guardian ad litem if the juvenile has no parent or guardian appearing for him, or if their interest conflicts with the juveniles', or if the court believes it is required in the interests of the child, apply to a hearing under that section of Vermont's statute adopting the Interstate Compact on the Placement of Children which allows an adjudicated delinquent to be placed in an out-of-state institution upon hearing and a finding that equivalent facilities are not available in Vermont and institutional care in the other state is in the best interests of the juvenile and will not produce undue hardship. In re J.S., 139 Vt. 6, 420 A.2d 870 (1980).
    </p>
    <h5 id="t33p04c55-annotationsfromformerchapter55-4">
     <b>
      4. Nature of proceedings.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     Proceedings under this chapter are protective, not penal. In re R.S., 143 Vt. 565, 469 A.2d 751 (1983).
    </p>
    <p>
     Child neglect proceedings are concerned entirely with the welfare of the child. In re Neglected Child, 130 Vt. 525, 296 A.2d 250 (1972).
    </p>
    <p>
     Proceedings as to dependent and neglected children are protective, not penal, with no legislative purpose to condemn the child or its parents for the difficulties of the situation. In re Rathburn, 128 Vt. 429, 266 A.2d 423 (1970).
    </p>
    <p>
     Juvenile proceedings in Vermont are protective proceedings concerned entirely with the welfare of the child, and are not punitive; the inquiry relates to proper custody for the child, not his guilt or innocence as a criminal offender. In re Rich, 125 Vt. 373, 216 A.2d 266 (1965).
    </p>
    <h5 id="t33p04c55-annotationsfromformerchapter55-5">
     <b>
      5. Authority of State.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     State, pursuant to long-recognized doctrine of parens patriae, is empowered to enact laws for the protection, care, custody, and support of children within its jurisdictional limits. In re N.H., 135 Vt. 230, 373 A.2d 851 (1977).
    </p>
    <p>
     Power allocated to state to enact laws for protection, care, custody, and support of children is awesome and is necessarily subject to certain restraints imposed by Legislature. In re N.H., 135 Vt. 230, 373 A.2d 851 (1977).
    </p>
    <p>
     When the State is regulating the area of child neglect, it acts as parens patriae to the child. In re Neglected Child, 130 Vt. 525, 296 A.2d 250 (1972).

     <b>
      6. Intervention by State.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     In determining that a child is endangered and that State intervention is necessary, the court is to act with great care in deciding what type of intervention is appropriate.

      7. Minors subject to jurisdiction.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     Under this chapter, persons who are under 18 and have had a petition of neglect or unmanageability brought, or persons from 10 to 16 who are declared by the court to be delinquent, are minors subject to the jurisdiction of the juvenile court; furthermore, persons from 16 to 18 who are charged as criminal defendants can be transferred to juvenile court jurisdiction and once jurisdiction is in the court, it remains there until a child turns 21 years of age. 1968-70 Op. Atty. Gen. 182.

      8. Confidentiality.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     The confidentiality provisions of this chapter do not by their terms restrict their application to delinquency proceedings. In re J.R., 146 Vt. 185, 499 A.2d 1155 (1985).

    <h5 id="t33p04c55-annotationsfromformerchapter55-9">
     <b>
      9. Evidence.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     Where there was no statutory authorization for court to order a psychiatric examination of the mother in proceeding upon petition alleging her children were in need of care and supervision, the psychiatrist's report and testimony should have been excluded from evidence, and given the insufficiency of the State's case without that evidence, the decision that the children were without parental care necessary for their emotional and mental well-being and that they should be transferred to the State, with residual rights remaining in the mother, must be reversed. In re T.L.S., 139 Vt. 197, 425 A.2d 96 (1980).
    </p>
    <p>
     Hearsay, opinion, gossip, bias, prejudice, trends of hostile neighborhood feeling, the hopes and fears of social workers, are all sources of error and have no more place in juvenile courts that in any other court. In re Lee, 126 Vt. 156, 224 A.2d 917 (1966).

         1. Constitutional requirements.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The freedom of children and parents to relate to one another in the context of the family, free of governmental interference, is a basic liberty long established in constitutional law, thus in order to insure that this fundamental liberty will not be unduly tampered with the Legislature has expressly provide that a child be separated from its parents only when necessary for his welfare or in the interests of public safety.

         2. Welfare of child.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        When a juvenile defendant charged with the second-degree murder of a man who came to his home to have sex with his mentally ill mother sought transfer of his case to juvenile court, his case had to be considered in the context of defendant's increasing frustration at his inability to control the escalating events at home - events of the most humiliating and degrading nature for a child. That these events might have combined to overwhelm his youthful judgment was to inform the district court's discretion in light of the special status accorded juvenile cases by the Legislature. Chase v. State, 184 Vt. 430, 966 A.2d 139 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Ability of the public to follow a case through the judicial system was not a proper consideration in denying defendant's motion to transfer his case to juvenile court, and was not entitled to independent weight as a matter of law. A primary purpose of the juvenile court system is to protect juveniles from the taint of criminality that inevitably results from the publicity and permanence of convictions in the district court; the other provisions of the chapter regarding judicial proceedings in juvenile cases, including the discretionary transfer provisions, are to be construed to give effect to the purposes announced for the chapter. State v. Dixon, 185 Vt. 92, 967 A.2d 1114 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Primary concern of court construing this section must be with the welfare of the child. In re R.B., 152 Vt. 415, 566 A.2d 1310 (1989), cert. denied, Appleby v. Young, 493 U.S. 1086, 110 S. Ct. 1151, 107 L. Ed. 2d 1055 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Laws adopted by state for protection, care, custody, and support of children are designed to establish protective procedures, primarily concerned with welfare of the child. In re N.H., 135 Vt. 230, 373 A.2d 851 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Juvenile proceedings in Vermont are protective proceedings entirely concerned with the welfare of the child, and are not punitive; the inquiry relates to proper custody for the child, not his guilt or innocence as a criminal offender. In re Rich, 125 Vt. 373, 216 A.2d 266 (1965).

        Provision of this section that a child be separated from its parents only when necessary for his welfare or in the interests of public safety does not allow for intervention simply because a child might be better off somewhere else. In re N.H., 135 Vt. 230, 373 A.2d 851 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where child who had been abused by mother was in need of care or supervision, and father, despite existence of questions concerning his ability to assume active, responsible parental role, stood willing and able, with support of his parents, to provide child with a family environment, disposition order transferring custody to the Department would be vacated in absence of any convincing proof that father was an unfit parent, demonstrably incapable of providing appropriate home for child.

        Parental rights cannot be terminated simply because a child may be better off in another home. In re E.B., 158 Vt. 8, 603 A.2d 373 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is a legislative policy of permitting adoption without parental consent only when the best interests of the child cannot be achieved by temporary removal and placement outside the home, and that total termination of parental rights will not be ordered in the first instance if there is a reasonable possibility that the situation can be remedied and the family reunited within a reasonable time. In re D.R., 136 Vt. 478, 392 A.2d 951 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Though juvenile court has the power to sever all parental rights upon a finding that a minor is in need of care or supervision, such power should be used with extreme care and only as a last resort in carrying out the legislative purpose of providing for the care, protection, and wholesome development of children, and this purpose is to be achieved, when possible, in a family environment, with separation of child and parents only when necessary for the child's welfare or in the interests of public safety. In re D.R., 136 Vt. 478, 392 A.2d 951 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order completely severing all parental rights and allowing adoption of six-year-old girl would be vacated where it was entered after initial finding of inability of parents to properly care for the child without leaving open the possibility in the future that the situation could be remedied and the family reunited.

       <p>
        In a termination of parental rights case where the trial court denied the parents' request to transfer their rights to the child's aunt and uncle, there was ample current evidence to support the trial court's findings. While their exact placement recommendations might not have been current, both experts provided credible evidence to support the findings that the child had a strong bond with her foster mother and that a transition to her aunt and uncle would take time and would require the cooperation of both households; furthermore, the trial court also heard testimony from people directly involved in the child's care, including her therapist, day-care provider, foster parent, aunt, and caseworkers, who provided current information about the child and her relationships. In re W.L., 185 Vt. 641, 974 A.2d 602 (mem.) (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a termination of parental rights case where the trial court denied the parents' request to transfer their rights to the child's aunt and uncle, the trial court properly held that a shared custody arrangement between the child's foster mother and the aunt and uncle was not in the child's best interests. The trial court primarily rejected the arrangement because it would delay permanency, and it also credibly found that a shared arrangement was not a possibility given the inability of the foster mother and the aunt and uncle to work together. In re W.L., 185 Vt. 641, 974 A.2d 602 (mem.) (2009).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Protection and interest of the public was a rational basis, for purposes of due process analysis, of statute vesting original jurisdiction in the criminal court over certain enumerated serious offenses committed by persons 14 to 16 years of age, and for mandating that, absent mitigating circumstances such as would justify transfer to juvenile court, such persons be tried as adults. State v. Buelow, 155 Vt. 537, 587 A.2d 948 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where determination of district court that child was in need of care and supervision was based on a finding that the mother was not caring for or supervising her child, and not upon the mother's having travelled out of the State, the court's finding that the child was in need of care and supervision and transfer of custody of the child to the State based upon that finding did not violate the mother's right to travel under the United States and Vermont Constitutions. In re S.A.M., 140 Vt. 194, 436 A.2d 736 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutory definition of neglected child is detailed enough to govern the achievement of the purposes the statute seeks to fulfill, establishes reasonable standards, and is not so broadly termed as to be unconstitutional. In re Neglected Child, 130 Vt. 525, 296 A.2d 250 (1972).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Because he was 14 years old at time of alleged offense, juvenile was himself a person within protection of statutory rape statute and thus could not be adjudicated a delinquent child based on his alleged violation of that statute. In re G.T., 170 Vt. 507, 758 A.2d 301 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        In making a determination of delinquency, the crucial inquiry is whether the act committed is designated a crime under a statute, not whether the juvenile could be criminally prosecuted under the statute. In re P.M., 156 Vt. 303, 592 A.2d 862 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since a delinquent act is defined as an act designated as a crime under State law, and juvenile was found to have engaged in conduct which would constitute the crime of engaging in lewd or lascivious conduct with a child, under the plain language of the statutory provisions, juvenile could be found guilty of having committed a delinquent act. In re P.M., 156 Vt. 303, 592 A.2d 862 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since all constitutional guarantees associated with traditional prosecutions apply to juvenile delinquency proceedings, Supreme Court will not search the record or accept conclusionary findings which merely repeat the definition of "delinquent act" in this section. In re R.B., 134 Vt. 368, 360 A.2d 77 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, though it was stipulated that a lewd and lascivious act was performed upon the complaining witness, no other facts were stipulated, the only finding was that the alleged delinquent committed a lewd act, and the lower court judge failed to state the facts bringing the case within the ambit of 13 V.S.A.
        §
        2602, making it a crime to commit a lewd and lascivious act on a child under the age of 16, a delinquent child being defined as one who has committed a delinquent act and such an act being defined as an act designated a crime under the laws of the State, the ultimate conclusion of delinquency could not stand; and argument that the act had been stipulated to was to no avail where the ultimate finding of delinquency and who had committed the act were disputed.

        Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services, as legal custodian of a juvenile adjudicated to be a child in need of care and supervision, had authority to place the juvenile in a group home without judicial approval, so long as the placement was not prohibited by statute. In re B.L., 149 Vt. 375, 543 A.2d 265 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The definition of "legal custody" in subdivision (a)(10) of this section leaves no doubt that once a child is placed in legal custody his or her custodian has the authority to determine where he or she shall be placed, and implicit in the subdivision is the admonition that the juvenile court has no authority to dictate where and with whom a juvenile should live, since this would contravene the clear authority granted to the legal custodian. In re G.F., 142 Vt. 273, 455 A.2d 805 (1982).

         4. Need of care or supervision

        .
       </h5>
       <p>
        In statute defining a child in need of care or supervision (CHINS) as one who, among other things, is "without proper parental care," use of term "parental care" does not compel a CHINS adjudication whenever incapacitated parents leave their children with relatives or others to provide "parental" care during period of incapacitation. In re G.C., 170 Vt. 329, 749 A.2d 28 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Notice to parents in CHINS cases is sufficient if the supporting affidavits recite the substance of the allegations plainly and with particularity so that the parties are afforded an adequate opportunity to respond; thus where the petitions clearly noted that the State was proceeding under
        §
        5502(a)(12)(A) and (B) and specific allegations appeared in the affidavits, the court was free to conclude that the children were CHINS under either subsection of the statute, and the parent was not denied adequate notice. In re F.P., 164 Vt. 117, 665 A.2d 597 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The State is not required to make an election under subdivision (a)(12) of this section, as its possible for a child to be in need of care or supervision because of the existence of circumstances described in one or more of the subdivisions of subdivision (a)(12). In re R.M., 150 Vt. 59, 549 A.2d 1050 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although it would be better practice for the State to provide for specific allegations of the grounds relied on in a petition to have a child declared to be in need of care or supervision, a petition which merely quotes the definition of a child in need of care or supervision in subdivision (a)(12)(B) of this section is sufficient. In re A.D., 143 Vt. 432, 467 A.2d 121 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        In proceedings to have a child declared to be a child in need of care and supervision, it would be better practice for the State to provide for specific allegations of the grounds relied on in its petition. In re S.A.M., 140 Vt. 194, 436 A.2d 736 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there were two affidavits attached to the petition filed in proceedings to have a child declared to be a child in need of care and supervision which plainly recited that the child was "without proper parental care or subsistence, education, medical or other care necessary for her well-being," this was sufficient notice of the grounds on which the State based its case that the child was in need of care and supervision. In re S.A.M., 140 Vt. 194, 436 A.2d 736 (1981).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Minor was properly enrolled in a home-study program under statute because Commissioner of Education failed to order hearing within 45 days of receiving mother's notice of enrollment; minor could therefore not properly be adjudicated a child in need of care and supervision on basis of truancy from school. In re T.M., 171 Vt. 1, 756 A.2d 793 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court's determination that infant child was in need of care or supervision (CHINS) was supported by evidence of mother's extensive psychiatric history, and although there was no evidence that foster-care arrangement for mother and child had failed to provide child with support at time it was removed from foster family's home, family court correctly focused on likelihood of prospective harm to child. In re G.C., 170 Vt. 329, 749 A.2d 28 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence did not adequately support finding that child was in need of care and supervision (CHINS), where finding was based on mother's disbelief of a single act of alleged abuse by her boyfriend, and there was testimony that child had injured his head by falling on ice. In re T.R., 169 Vt. 574, 730 A.2d 621 (mem.) (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        There must be some evidence of a sexual motive or intent for a finding of sexual abuse. In re D.C., 160 Vt. 608, 648 A.2d 816 (mem.) (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence that, for substantial periods, child was unclean, poorly clothed, and exposed to dangerous living conditions was sufficient to support finding that child was in need of care or supervision. In re M.B., 158 Vt. 63, 605 A.2d 515 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Generally, an allegation of sexual abuse by a stranger in the home is insufficient to support a CHINS finding as an innocent family should not be punished for another's crime; but a CHINS finding is proper in circumstances in which children suffer not from an isolated incident of abuse, but rather are being raised in a manner that allows such abuse to occur and subjects them to dangers that their parent cannot prevent. In re M.B., 158 Vt. 63, 605 A.2d 515 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        For purposes of determination of whether a child is in need of care and supervision (CHINS), the fact that the child refuses to return home after staying with a relative for a short period of time with parental permission cannot support the conclusion that the child is without or beyond the control of his parents. In re B.B., 155 Vt. 365, 584 A.2d 1126 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where evidence did not support juvenile court's determination that child was in need of care and supervision (CHINS) on the basis that she had run away from home and refused to return and was thus beyond parental control, fact that evidence might have supported the same conclusion on alternate basis of parental abuse would not suffice to uphold CHINS determination; Supreme Court would not reconstruct the State's case on a theory not relied upon in the petition and not accepted by the juvenile court. In re B.B., 155 Vt. 365, 584 A.2d 1126 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court which transferred legal custody and guardianship of two children to the Commissioner of Social and Rehabilitation Services did not err in concluding that the children were in need of care and supervision where evidence adduced at hearings disclosed that the mother had applied a commercial cleanser to the body of one child when he was an infant, had threatened to throw him from a second-story porch, had tried to strangle him, when he was three years old that child had told a social worker that he had been punched and kicked by his mother, on another occasion that same social worker had witnessed the mother shove a bassinet containing the other child against a couch and them remove the infant by one leg and carry her in that manner into another room, the mother had once struck one of the children causing a significant bruise to his jaw, banged his head against the wall and threw him to the floor, the mother had been offered mental health treatment as well as parental and marriage counselling but her cooperation with these efforts had been infrequent or inadequate, and the children's stepfather had been unable to control the mother's violent behavior or provide a stable and caring atmosphere in the presence of the mother. In re T.L.S., 144 Vt. 536, 481 A.2d 1037 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where grandparents of child who was subject of proceedings to determine whether child was in need of care and supervision did not have legal custody of the child, but merely cared for the child, evidence that grandparents failed to provide care to child was not necessary to support filing of petition alleging that child was in need of care and supervision and seeking transfer of custody of child to State. In re S.A.M., 140 Vt. 194, 436 A.2d 736 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any time the State seeks to interfere with the rights of parents on the generalized assumption that the children are in need of care and supervision it must first produce sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the statutory directives allowing such intervention are fully satisfied. In re N.H., 135 Vt. 230, 373 A.2d 851 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court was justified in assuming jurisdiction to determine if child was in need of care or supervision and in rendering its conclusion that child was an abused child without proper parental care and control, although State had not demonstrated that both parents were involved in the abuse, or showed a culpable disinterest in the child's welfare. In re N.H., 135 Vt. 230, 373 A.2d 851 (1977).

       <p>
        Family court's findings supported the conclusion that the father physically abused his children, despite his assertion that he had a constitutional right to hit his children and that unless the court found that the children's general health was threatened by his blows or that those blows resulted in medical attention it could not conclude that his corporal punishment was abusive and unreasonable. In re F.P., 164 Vt. 117, 665 A.2d 597 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where ample evidence justified family court's determination that child was without proper parental care as to her mother and there was no evidence that her father was ready, willing, or able to undertake custody, any error
    in court's CHINS ruling as to abuse or abandonment was harmless. In re A.O., 161 Vt. 302, 640 A.2d 537 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        On appeal from determination that child was in need of care and supervision (CHINS), facts of father's abuse and mother's refusal or inability to keep daughter from husband's sole company were clear on the record and were sufficient, standing alone, to support CHINS finding as a matter of law. In re C.M., 157 Vt. 100, 595 A.2d 293 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        In disposition order determining that three siblings were children in need of care and supervision, in which the court made a specific finding of abuse only with respect to the eldest child, findings concerning the two younger children, although brief, were sufficient in the circumstances; testimony of eldest child provided sufficient evidence of the abuse of younger siblings and court was justified in finding that a pattern of abuse and general inability of the mother to protect any of the children required the court to protect all three children from further physical violations. In re L.A., 154 Vt. 147, 574 A.2d 782 (1990).

       <p>
        Lower courts must carry out their duty to state facts which bring a particular neglected child case within the ambit of the statutory law, for the Supreme Court will no longer search the record nor will it accept conclusionary findings which merely repeat the definition of neglected child set forth in the statutes. In re J.M., 131 Vt. 604, 313 A.2d 30 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where evidence was undisputed that bruises on the body and injuries on the throat of a ten-month old baby were the result of the father's blows and improper feeding, the child was without proper parental care and "neglected." In re Neglected Child, 129 Vt. 234, 276 A.2d 14 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        A statutory provision as to what constitutes a neglected child should be liberally construed to aid the purpose of its enactment. In re Rathburn, 128 Vt. 429, 266 A.2d 423 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        The phrase "without proper parental care" has a less restricted meaning than the word "neglect," which in a legal sense means failure to do what the law requires. In re Rathburn, 128 Vt. 429, 266 A.2d 423 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Provision of this section defining "neglected child" does not require, in cases where the child is sought to be taken from the custody of a parent, that there be a willful conduct by the parent. In re Rathburn, 128 Vt. 429, 266 A.2d 423 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Provision of this section defining "neglected child" did not require that baby which State sought to have declared neglected, and whose father was unknown, be in the physical custody of mother who sought to keep baby. In re Rathburn, 128 Vt. 429, 266 A.2d 423 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Baby whose father was unknown lacked proper parental care and control, and its mother, who sought to keep it, could not meet the demands of this section, where the mother had a mental illness of a lasting type, would probably not recover, was unable to withstand stressful situations, became emotional and upset, was unable to assume responsibility, even for her own personal care, and was confined to a mental hospital. In re Rathburn, 128 Vt. 429, 266 A.2d 423 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Baby was a neglected child within the meaning of this section where its father was unknown and its mother was confined to a mental hospital with a mental illness of a lasting type from which she would probably not recover and was unable to withstand stress, became emotional and upset, and was unable to assume responsibility, even for her personal care.

        Where mental condition of mother of baby whose father was unknown and which State sought to have declared neglected was such that she was unable to withstand stressful situations, became emotional and upset, was unable to assume responsibility, and was not competent to be responsible for her own personal care, whether the baby had been under her actual care and custody made no difference.

        §
        5503(a), the family court has exclusive jurisdiction over all proceedings concerning any child who is or who is alleged to be a child in need of care or supervision (CHINS); the statute clearly empowers the family court to hear the CHINS petition, regardless of its merit.

        Although this section confers broad jurisdiction in cases of abuse and neglect, in most instances involving interstate disputes the Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act, 15 V.S.A.
        §
        1031 et seq., will operate to require this State to decline to exercise jurisdiction in deference to the other state where the latter is the home state of the child or if the other state has jurisdiction over the matter and is the more appropriate forum.

        §
        5527) of this title included a condition that mother obtain counselling, mother's claim that the Department should pay for her counseling fees, although related to the case plan, was not a proceeding over which the juvenile court had exclusive jurisdiction under subsection (a) of this section, and Human Services Board erred in determining that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction to address mother's appeal of the Department's denial of her claim.

        This section and section 667 (now
        §
        5540) of this title, which give the juvenile court the ultimate decision as to what is in the child's best interest, clearly imply the authority of the juvenile court to reject a treatment plan proposed by the legal guardian; the requirement of section 655 (now
        <span class="s1">
         §

       <p>
        In considering defendant's motion to transfer his case to juvenile court, the trial court did not err in finding that the prospect for adequate protection of the public and the likelihood of reasonable rehabilitation of defendant weighed against transfer. The trial court's finding that defendant's supervisory needs would exceed the temporal grasp of the juvenile court was supported by the testimony of the State's expert, and the court would not question on appeal the factfinder's decision to credit that testimony over the contrary testimony of defendant's expert; it was within the trial court's discretion to conclude that despite there being no public-protection basis for retaining jurisdiction, the need for more time to rehabilitate defendant supported trial in district court. State v. Dixon, 185 Vt. 92, 967 A.2d 1114 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a juvenile defendant charged with the second-degree murder of a man who came to his home to have sex with his mentally ill mother sought transfer of his case to juvenile court, his case had to be considered in the context of defendant's increasing frustration at his inability to control the escalating events at home - events of the most humiliating and degrading nature for a child. That these events might have combined to overwhelm his youthful judgment was to inform the district court's discretion in light of the special status accorded juvenile cases by the Legislature. State v. Dixon, 185 Vt. 92, 967 A.2d 1114 (2008).
       </p>

        The decision to transfer a case to juvenile court lies within the sound discretion of the trial court, and the Supreme Court will review the court's exercise of discretion on a case-by-case basis. State v. Buelow, 155 Vt. 537, 587 A.2d 948 (1990).

       </p>
       <p>
        Although transfer proceedings are open to the public and juvenile records are not statutory protected from public scrutiny, the trial judge should exercise his discretion to accommodate a defendant's concern for the confidentiality of his juvenile records.

       </p>

        To achieve the rehabilitative functions of the juvenile justice systems, the Legislature left the propriety of transferring a case to juvenile court to the sound discretion assessment in this regard, the court must have access to otherwise confidential juvenile records.

       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of motion to transfer case to juvenile court was affirmed where trial court properly exercised its discretion to protect confidentiality of defendant's juvenile records insofar as possible under the circumstances by reviewing the records in camera and striking references to it in the State's memorandum.

       <p>
        Trial court's refusal to transfer criminal case to juvenile court was supported where adult probation could be more effectively enforced than juvenile probation, defendant lacked empathy or sadness about doing crimes, defendant's prior juvenile record included petty larceny, burglary, and retail theft, and defendant's crimes of simple assault and unlawful mischief were more serious than past offenses. State v. Lafayette, 152 Vt. 108, 564 A.2d 1068 (1989), overruled on other grounds, In re J.G. (1993) 160 Vt. 250, 627 A.2d 362.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's denial of motion to transfer criminal case to juvenile court, based on inability of juvenile court to effectively enforce restitution, was erroneous because juvenile court could use its contempt power under section 666 [now
        §
        5539] of this title to enforce or punish noncompliance with its orders. State v. Lafayette, 152 Vt. 108, 564 A.2d 1068 (1989), overruled on other grounds, In re J.G. (1993) 160 Vt. 250, 627 A.2d 362.

        Emancipation of 16-year-old defendant was supported by father's testimony that defendant was pretty much emancipated and that plans to return to school were uncertain, and seriousness of crime, found by trial court in severe property damage connected with burning of car and defendant's contempt for victims, was sufficient to warrant treatment as adult, when considered with findings on emancipation.

       </h5>
       <p>
        In considering a motion by a juvenile defendant to transfer his second-degree murder case to juvenile court, the factor of whether the offense was against persons or property was not entitled to great weight, because it was nearly identical to the factor concerning the offense's seriousness. State v. Dixon, 185 Vt. 92, 967 A.2d 1114 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Ability of the public to follow a case through the judicial system was not a proper consideration in denying defendant's motion to transfer his case to juvenile court, and was not entitled to independent weight as a matter of law. A primary purpose of the juvenile court system is to protect juveniles from the taint of criminality that inevitably results from the publicity and permanence of convictions in the district court; the other provisions of the chapter regarding judicial proceedings in juvenile cases, including the discretionary transfer provisions, are to be construed to give effect to the purposes announced for the chapter. State v. Dixon, 185 Vt. 92, 967 A.2d 1114 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a juvenile defendant charged with second-degree murder sought transfer of his case to juvenile court, the trial court was plainly correct in finding that second-degree murder was a serious offense. State v. Dixon, 185 Vt. 92, 967 A.2d 1114 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        In considering a motion by a juvenile defendant to transfer his case to juvenile court, it was within the province of the trial court to determine from the weight of the evidence that the offense was committed in an aggressive, violent, or premeditated manner. State v. Dixon, 185 Vt. 92, 967 A.2d 1114 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        By definition, in all cases in which a juvenile defendant seeks transfer from the district court to the juvenile court, the "prosecutive merit" question has already been decided by the court's finding of probable cause. Accordingly, where defendant sought a transfer to juvenile court, the trial court's conclusion that this factor weighed against transfer was erroneous. State v. Dixon, 185 Vt. 92, 967 A.2d 1114 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        In considering a defendant's motion to transfer a case to juvenile court, the better approach to the prosecutive-merit analysis is for the court to determine whether the State can make out a prima facie case for the charged crime. That is, the State must prove that it has evidence that would fairly and reasonably tend to show beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant committed the offense. State v. Dixon, 185 Vt. 92, 967 A.2d 1114 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appellate review of a trial court's decision on a motion to transfer a case to juvenile court is not based solely on a mathematical computation of factors; to do so would suggest unnecessary limits on the exercise of discretion. The trial court must also exercise its discretion based on consideration of all the circumstances, whether assigned or assignable to any particular factor or factors. State v. Dixon, 185 Vt. 92, 967 A.2d 1114 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where trial court acted within its discretion denying motion of 14-year-old defendant charged with murder to transfer proceeding to juvenile court, the court's imprecise and mistaken characterizations that statute granting criminal curt original jurisdiction created a "presumption" against defendant's suitability for juvenile proceedings, and that defendant had not presented any "extraordinary attributes" that would remove him from the jurisdiction of the criminal court were not significant where findings and conclusions otherwise demonstrated the court's understanding of its jurisdiction and discretion. State v. Buelow, 155 Vt. 537, 587 A.2d 948 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under subsection (b) of this section adequate findings of fact are required, so that Supreme Court may determine whether the sound discretion of the trial court implicitly mandated by subsection (b) was in fact exercised. State v. Jacobs, 144 Vt. 70, 472 A.2d 1247 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Purported findings of district court which denied defendant's motion to transfer his case to juvenile court which merely recited testimony of witnesses and summarized the arguments and position of the State's Attorney could not stand as findings. State v. Jacobs, 144 Vt. 70, 472 A.2d 1247 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Determination under this section is critical one, and literal compliance with this section is not enough; adequate findings of fact are required, so that it may be determined whether sound discretion implicitly mandated by statute was in fact exercised. State v. Powers, 136 Vt. 167, 385 A.2d 1067 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where determination is to be made whether to transfer offender to juvenile court to be treated as delinquent child rather than as criminal, hearing, and findings of fact resulting therefrom, must be accorded offender on remand, and, because of summary and arbitrary nature of ruling that denied these rights in first instance, to avoid any claim of bias or prejudice on rehearing it is advisable that different judge preside over hearings on remand. State v. Powers, 136 Vt. 167, 385 A.2d 1067 (1978).

         9. Appeal.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where motion of 23-year-old defendant to transfer charges to juvenile court would result in dismissal of the charges since juvenile court would not have jurisdiction to try defendant, the motion to transfer charges was like a motion to dismiss that has been denied by the trial court and fell outside the "small class" of decision excepted from the final-judgment rule; however, the Supreme Court would review the merits in this instance in order to conserve judicial resources. State v. Gilman, 155 Vt. 649, 583 A.2d 84 (mem.) (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's denial of 23-year-old defendant's motion to transfer to juvenile court charges of assault and robbery resulting in physical injury allegedly committed when defendant was 16 was proper in light of defendant's extensive juvenile record and his mental status and of defendant's failure to show there was no reasonable basis for trial court's decision. State v. Gilman, 155 Vt. 649, 583 A.2d 84 (mem.) (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The only issues in an appeal from an order denying transfer of a criminal proceeding to juvenile court would be the sufficiency of the findings made by the trial court to support its decision and whether it abused its discretion in denying transfer. State v. Lafayette, 148 Vt. 288, 532 A.2d 560 (1987), overruled on other grounds, In re J.G. (1993) 160 Vt. 250, 627 A.2d 362.
       </p>
       <p>
        Order denying transfer of criminal proceeding to juvenile court was not an appropriate subject for interlocutory appeal pursuant to V.R.A.P. 5 (b)(1), since the issues involved in such appeal would hinge in large part, if not entirely, on an analysis of the factual record, and, therefore, were not "controlling questions of law" within the meaning of V.R.A.P 5(b)(1). State v. Lafayette, 148 Vt. 288, 532 A.2d 560 (1987), overruled on other grounds, In re J.G. (1993) 160 Vt. 250, 627 A.2d 362.

        The language of Vermont statutes defining a felony and providing that criminal proceedings against defendants between the ages of 16 and 18 may be transferred to juvenile court from the criminal courts at the discretion of the criminal courts makes plain that the Legislature intended that felony convictions of minor defendants could, in the trial court's discretion, be counted toward habitual-criminal status under the Vermont's habitual-criminal statute.

       <p>
        Unauthorized retransfer of sexual assault charge from family court to district court was a procedural shortcoming that was waived by defendant's guilty plea, and therefore district court did not lack jurisdiction to order adult probation or imprisonment. State v. Page, 171 Vt. 110, 757 A.2d 1038 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Juvenile court was without jurisdiction to retransfer 16-year-old defendant to district court for prosecution as an adult on a simple assault charge, since there had been no adjudication of delinquency and simple assault charge did not fall within the list of serious offenses which could be transferred to adult court.

         1. Petition by State's Attorney.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        There is no requirement that a voluntary petition by a parent, guardian, or person acting in behalf of a child be the only means for the State to intervene and provide substitute parental care and custody for a child; the Commissioner of Rehabilitation Services may request the State's Attorney to file a petition, which gives a court full authority to make the determination of whether or not a child is in need of care and supervision. In re S.A.M., 140 Vt. 194, 436 A.2d 736 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is proper for a State's Attorney to draft petitions for commitment of defendant or delinquent juveniles, sign such petitions, and give advice to prospective petitioners with respect to the contents of the petition. 1962-64 Op. Atty. Gen. 475.

       <p>
        Subsection (a) of this section, which states that a hearing must be held no later than 15 days after the filing of a petition to have children found in need of care or supervision, is a measure intended to protect all of the interests involved and to summon the participation of all parties forthwith.

       <p>
        This section and
        §§
        5520 and 5532(b) of this title require the family court to provide direct notice of a pending termination petition and hearing to the parents of children who are the subject of the petition, in addition to the parents' attorneys. Because that was not done, a termination order was required to be reversed and the matter remanded for further proceedings. In re M.T., 180 Vt. 643, 912 A.2d 456 (mem.) (November 7, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Hearing required by subsection (a) of this section occurs when all parties are present, jurisdiction is found, and an entry of a denial or admission to the petition is made. In re J.E.G., 144 Vt. 309, 476 A.2d 130 (1984).

         3. Time for hearing.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Although juvenile proceedings should be resolved as quickly as is reasonably possible, the time limits established by the governing statutes are directory and not jurisdictional; underlying the statutory scheme is the goal of furthering the best interests of the children whose future is at stake. In re M.B., 158 Vt. 63, 605 A.2d 515 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although CHINS proceedings were unusually protracted between time when the children were taken into temporary custody and the date of the court order finding that the children in fact were in need of care and supervision, and despite the fact that a seven-month delay in the issuance of the court's decision was not explained, the delay was no basis on which to grant relief from the court's order in light of the substantiated allegation that the mother was unable to care adequately for her two children. In re M.B., 158 Vt. 63, 605 A.2d 515 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Provision of this section requiring trial court to fix a time for hearing on petition to declare a child in need of supervision within 15 days of filing of the petition is directory, not jurisdictional, and failure to comply with the time requirements does not automatically divest the trial court of jurisdiction or result in voiding of a child in need of supervision adjudication or disposition order. In re C.I., 155 Vt. 52, 580 A.2d 985 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutory requirement that hearing be held within 15 days of filing petition to declare child in need of supervision was complied with, where hearing which was convened within limit addressed preliminary matters and mother's request for a continuance. In re C.I., 155 Vt. 52, 580 A.2d 985 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        For purposes of statutory requirement that hearings on petition to declare a child in need of supervision be held within 15 days of filing of petition, compliance does not depend on whether a particular hearing is "significant." In re C.I., 155 Vt. 52, 580 A.2d 985 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Time limits in statutes providing for hearings to determine whether a child is in need of care and supervision and for disposition hearings following such determinations are directory only and not jurisdictional, so that noncompliance does not void either a disposition order or an adjudication that a child is in need of care or supervision. In re J.V., 154 Vt. 644, 573 A.2d 1196 (mem.) (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where State filed juvenile delinquency petition on January 26, 1981, hearing held on February 5, 1981, at which all parties were present, the court found jurisdiction and probable cause, substitute counsel for juvenile entered a denial to the petition and the court continued the hearing, which reconvened on February 25, 1981, to allow juvenile's regular attorney time to prepare, satisfied requirement of subsection (a) of this section that a hearing be held not later than 15 days after the filing of the delinquency petition. In re J.E.G., 144 Vt. 309, 476 A.2d 130 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        The important policies supporting the need resolution of juvenile proceedings outweigh the hardship which subsection (a) of this section imposes upon parties by requiring them to prepare their cases on short notice. In re R.S., 143 Vt. 565, 469 A.2d 751 (1983); In re J.E.G., 144 Vt. 309, 476 A.2d 130 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Juvenile court complied with subsection (a) of this section, requiring a detention hearing to be held within 15 days of the filing of a petition to have children found to be in need of care or supervision, where a hearing at which all parties were present was convened within the mandated time but continued to allow the parties additional time to prepare. In re R.S., 143 Vt. 565, 469 A.2d 751 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where this chapter required that a hearing be held not later than 15 days after the filing of petition alleging that a child is in need of care or supervision and hearing was held some two months after the filing of the petition, and court did not state the facts which brought the case within the ambit of this chapter, disposition order would be vacated. In re F.E.B., 133 Vt. 463, 346 A.2d 191 (1975).

        Neither the Vermont nor the United States Constitution, as interpreted by the United States Supreme Court or the Vermont Supreme Court, provides a right of public access which overrides the compelling interests served by this section. In re J.S., 140 Vt. 458, 438 A.2d 1125 (1981).

         2. Confidentiality.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The family court, in authorizing disclosure of appellant's alcohol abuse treatment records, erred in failing to consider the potential injury to the physician-patient relationship and to treatment services in balancing the relevant interests, instead looking solely at the embarrassment to appellant from disclosure in light of the nonpublic nature of juvenile proceedings; although it is relevant that juvenile proceedings are not public, the court's inquiry was far too narrow and omitted any consideration of appellant's willingness to participate in treatment if she knew that her diagnosis and treatment information could be used to terminate her parental rights. In re B.S., 163 Vt. 445, 659 A.2d 1137 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section requires that juvenile court proceedings be confidential. In re J.S., 140 Vt. 458, 438 A.2d 1125 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Provisions of this section are clear and unambiguous; the Legislature did not intend that either the news media or the general public should attend juvenile hearings or report what transpired there. In re J.S., 140 Vt. 458, 438 A.2d 1125 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Reading provision of this section dealing with admissibility of the general public to juvenile proceedings and provision dealing with publicity of proceedings together, to give effect to each, leads to the inescapable result that a desire to publicly disseminate the facts of a juvenile proceeding is not a "proper interest in the case or in the work of the court" such as to entitle persons so interested to access to juvenile proceedings. In re J.S., 140 Vt. 458, 438 A.2d 1125 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        The State's compelling interests in confidential juvenile proceedings prescribed by this section override the countervailing interests of the public and the news media in access to those proceedings and the news media's interest in publicly disseminating what its reporters learn while attending for many reasons: publication of the youth's name could impair the rehabilitative goals of the juvenile justice system; confidential proceedings protect the delinquent from the stigma of conduct which may be outgrown and avoids the possibility that the adult is penalized for what he used to be, or worse yet, the possibility that the stigma becomes self-perpetuating, thereby making change and growth impossible; publication of a delinquent's name may handicap his prospects for adjustment into society, for acceptance by the public, or it may cause him to lose employment opportunities; and public proceedings could so embarrass the youth's family members that they withhold their support in rehabilitative efforts. In re J.S., 140 Vt. 458, 438 A.2d 1125 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Argument by newspaper seeking access to juvenile proceedings that pervasive newspaper publicity had already compromised the rehabilitative goals of confidentiality in the particular proceedings, and that, therefore, it should be allowed to attend and publicize proceedings, ignored the purpose of confidentiality to prevent publicity as a reward for the hardcore juvenile delinquent, thereby encouraging him to commit further antisocial acts to attract attention, and to further the legislative goal of expunging the juvenile's delinquency record, which would be vitiated if the same information could at any subsequent time be obtained freely from newspaper files. In re J.S., 140 Vt. 458, 438 A.2d 1125 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Argument by newspaper seeking access to juvenile proceedings that because of pervasive publicity there was no longer any reason for the confidentiality imposed by this section in the case before the court, and that a special exception should be made allowing public and private access to the juvenile proceeding, was unacceptable on several grounds; first, publicity sometimes serves as a reward for incorrigible delinquents, encouraging the very behavior sought to be deterred; second, such an approach calls for a case-by-case analysis to determine if, when and to what extent access to juvenile proceedings should be limited; third, such a case-by-case analysis would allow the news media to control access to juvenile proceedings or to base access on chance circumstances and not the child's needs; and finally, this section protects by anonymity not just the names of delinquents but other matters which surface in a juvenile proceeding. In re J.S., 140 Vt. 458, 438 A.2d 1125 (1981).

        A guardian ad litem may be appointed for a child subjected to juvenile proceedings despite the existence of a parent or guardian and despite the dissent of the parent or guardian, if the interests of the child conflict with the interests of the parent or guardian.

        Father's dissent to appointment of guardian ad litem for juvenile whom State sought to send to an institution out of the State did not render the appointment erroneous, for the dissent of the father amounted to the appearance of a conflict of interest between father and child and rendered the father's guardianship for naught in the institutionalization proceeding.

        Although CHINS proceedings were unusually protracted between time when the children were taken into temporary custody and the date of the court order finding that the children in fact were in need of care and supervision, and despite the fact that a seven-month delay in the issuance of the court's decision was not explained, the delay was no basis on which to grant relief from the court's order in light of the substantiated allegation that the mother was unable to care adequately for her two children. In re M.B., 158 Vt. 63, 605 A.2d 515 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although juvenile proceedings should be resolved as quickly as is reasonably possible, the time limits established by the governing statutes are directory and not jurisdictional; underlying the statutory scheme is the goal of furthering the best interests of the children whose future is at stake. In re M.B., 158 Vt. 63, 605 A.2d 515 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        The time limits within which delinquency and disposition hearings are to be held are directory rather than jurisdictional requirements, so that noncompliance does not void either a disposition order or an adjudication that a child is in need of care or supervision. In re J.V., 154 Vt. 644, 573 A.2d 1196 (mem.) (1990).

        Thirty-day time limit of subsection (b) of this section is only directory, so that noncompliance with it does not result in voiding either the disposition order or the CHINS adjudication. In re J.R., 153 Vt. 85, 570 A.2d 154 (1989).

        Disposition order which allowed the parties to reopen the order for any reason and at any time after 30 days and to require a full dispositional hearing as if the first hearing and order never existed could not be reconciled with requirement of subsection (b) of this section that disposition hearing be no later than 30 days after merits hearing.

        A child may be found to be in need of care and supervision without any inquiry into the culpability of the child's noncustodial parent; it is only at the disposition stage of the proceedings that the fitness of a noncustodial parent becomes an issue. In re B.L., 145 Vt. 586, 494 A.2d 145 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since petitions filed by the State alleging abuse and neglect of minor children concerned only issues to be resolved at the merits hearing and rights of the children's noncustodial parents were not at issue at the merits hearing, there was no error in the petitions failing to allege that the noncustodial parents were responsible for the alleged abuse and neglect.

       </p>
       <p>
        At the merits stage of a CHINS proceeding, the State has the burden to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that the children in question are in need of care or supervision, i.e., that they have been abandoned or abused or are without proper parental care or subsistence necessary for their well-being.

       <p>
        The key word in provision of this section that "if the court finds that the allegations made in the petition have been established, it shall find that the child is delinquent, or neglected, or unmanageable" is the word "established," and where criminal conduct is involved it means proof beyond a reasonable doubt, consistent with constitutional requirements.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Where noncustodial fathers had notice of all proceedings relative to the care and custody of their minor children, and were present and represented by counsel at the disposition hearing, they were afforded notice and an opportunity to be heard at the proceedings at which their parental rights were at issue. In re B.L., 145 Vt. 586, 494 A.2d 145 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the case of three children found to be in need of care or supervision where the termination of residual parental rights was not at issue, the juvenile court was correct in accepting a judicial admission by the father's counsel at the merits hearing, conceding that the children were in need of care or supervision, without first inquiring whether he understood the rights he relinquished and the consequences thereof, since the hearing could not, of itself, prevent the father from gaining custody and he was present when the admission were entered on his behalf. In re R.S., 143 Vt. 565, 469 A.2d 751 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        A parent has a fundamental right to custody and control of his child, which can be defeated only upon a showing that the child has been abandoned or abused, or that it is without proper parental care or subsistence, education, medical, or other care necessary for its well-being.

       </p>
       <p>
        Hearsay evidence, though admissible in a disposition hearing, may not be relied upon in determining parental unfitness where a proper objection has been made. In re R.L., 148 Vt. 223, 531 A.2d 909 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence concerning the appropriate disposition of children is irrelevant to the issue of whether children are in need of care and supervision, and should be excluded from the merits hearing. In re M.B., 147 Vt. 41, 509 A.2d 1014 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Testimony by father's brother and sister-in-law that they would work with the father, encouraging him to stay away from his family, to stay involved with the children to a certain extent while permitting the mother to establish an independent household, was relevant to whether the children were in need of care and supervision and should have been admitted at hearing held pursuant to this section. In re M.B., 147 Vt. 41, 509 A.2d 1014 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a petition was filed to declare a child to be in need of care and supervision, hearsay allegations of parental unfitness in the affidavit which accompanied the petition and in the disposition report filed by the Commissioner of Social and Rehabilitation Services, although admissible at the disposition hearing, would have been inadmissible at the merits hearing and thus could not be used as a factual basis for determining parental unfitness. In re Y.B., 143 Vt. 344, 466 A.2d 1167 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a child neglect hearing on the merits, a psychiatric report on mother, considered by the court even though its maker is not available for cross-examination, is inadmissible hearsay, for parties to a juvenile proceeding have the right of cross-examination; but if the merits have been decided and a disposition hearing is in progress, the report is admissible.

        Where, in finding child neglected, court relied on hearsay psychiatric report on mother, the doctor not having been available for cross-examination, and the findings other than the report did not support a conclusion of neglect, the mother did not receive full due process and order transferring all parental rights to charity organization with no adoption limitation would be reversed.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Family court's determination that prematurely born child was in need of care and supervision (CHINS) was upheld, where court's findings as to lack of attention paid by parents to child, and their inability to attend to his special nutritional and nurturing needs, were not clearly erroneous and were supported in the record. In re D.T., 170 Vt. 148, 743 A.2d 1077 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the family court adopted a disposition report and plan to remove a child from the home, but failed to make written findings on the matter, the Supreme Court remanded the case because a disposition order removing a child from the parental home must be accompanied by written findings of fact. In re L.H., 165 Vt. 591, 682 A.2d 969 (mem.) (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the trial court adjudicating juvenile delinquency is statutorily required to make finding beyond mere conclusion that juvenile is delinquent, the court need not make findings on an element not disputed at trial. In re K.B., 155 Vt. 514, 586 A.2d 552 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        At hearing to adjudicate delinquency based on count of unlawful trespass, the trial court was not required to make specific finding that juvenile was on premises "without legal authority" where this element of the offense was not disputed at trial, and even if juvenile's status as personal friend of person entering premises who accompanied that friend to assist him in retrieving personal property was sufficient to give him legal authority to be on the premises, he was divested of authority by owner's request that defendant leave. In re K.B., 155 Vt. 514, 586 A.2d 552 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court in juvenile delinquency proceedings is statutorily required to make findings whether or not a party makes a request, under criminal procedural rules, for special findings; the mandated findings must be more than a conclusory statement that defendant is delinquent.

       </p>
       <p>
        Both merits and disposition orders must be accompanied by findings of fact which are sufficient to support court's conclusion that child is in need of care or supervision on its disposition order. In re M.C.P., 153 Vt. 275, 571 A.2d 627 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        In proceeding to determine if juvenile is a child in need of care of supervision, merits findings must be issued within a reasonable time. In re M.C.P., 153 Vt. 275, 571 A.2d 627 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's failure to issue timely merits findings before disposition hearing and to make valid merits and disposition finding was cured where, by agreement of the parties, a new disposition hearing was held and detailed findings were issued. In re M.C.P., 153 Vt. 275, 571 A.2d 627 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Merits findings which recited statutory grounds for finding a child to be in need of care or supervision and adopted by reference police officer's affidavit which only recited what the juvenile had told the officer were not sufficient to support court's conclusion that adjudged the juvenile a child in need of care of supervision.

       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme Court would not accept finding that child was without proper parental care, education, subsistence, medical care, and other care necessary for its well-being where the finding was simply a conclusion which repeated the statutory definition of a neglected child; without adequate findings Supreme Court could not determine if the facts supported the judgment in the particulars alleged in the petition and the conclusion child was neglected could not stand and order terminating all of father's residual parental rights, the father being in prison under a life sentence and the mother having relinquished all her parental rights, would be reversed.

       <p>
        Superior court had jurisdiction of writ of habeas corpus filed by mother requesting release of juvenile from detention pursuant to order under law relating to juveniles in need of care or supervision, and erroneously ruled it lacked jurisdiction on ground that proper avenue for review of the order was by appeal to supreme court, for both at time of the habeas corpus petition and the time of the hearing thereon, the juvenile was being restrained without any final adjudication of the juvenile petition. In re B.M.L. (1979) 137 Vt. 396, 406 A.2d 383, overruled, In re A.S., 152 Vt. 487, 567 A.2d 1139 (1989), cert. denied, Appleby v. Young, 493 U.S. 1087, 110 S. Ct. 1151, 107 L. Ed. 2d 1055 (1990).

        Where provision of this section establishing the requirements for finds and an order following hearing on the merits of a juvenile petition in regard to delinquent juvenile or juvenile in need of care and supervision did not impose a time limit upon juvenile court for filing either findings or an order, the court could not continue to detain a juvenile indefinitely until such time as it filed the required findings and order, as to do so would frustrate the intent of the juvenile proceeding statute, and superior court, to which habeas corpus petition claiming unreasonable delay in issuing findings and order was brought, had duty to determine whether an unreasonable time had elapsed since the hearing on the merits and issue a writ of habeas corpus if it determined the delay was unreasonable.

       <p>
        In a custody case, where the record illustrating a history of abuse strongly supported the conclusion that neither the father nor mother would be a suitable custodian for their juvenile son, leaving the family court to choose between granting custody to the child's grandmother or to the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services, with placement in a foster home, the court weighed the advantages and disadvantages of each option and properly awarded custody to the child's grandmother, with whom he had a positive relationship, determining that placement with the grandmother was in the child's best interests. In re J.D., 165 Vt. 440, 685 A.2d 1095 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Upon finding child to be a CHINS, court had authority to transfer custody from mother to child's father or grandmother only if it found that individual to be qualified to receive and care for child. In re C.A., 160 Vt. 503, 630 A.2d 1292 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where child's father was not custodial parent before CHINS proceeding, court could not transfer custody to father under provision of statute allowing court to permit child to remain with his parents. In re C.A., 160 Vt. 503, 630 A.2d 1292 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        When juvenile court transfers legal custody of a child adjudicated a child in need of care and supervision, but leaves residual parental rights and responsibilities with the parents, it is error if the court fails to consider parental visitation rights consistent with the best interests of the child. In re L.A., 154 Vt. 147, 574 A.2d 782 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a court seeks to remove a child from the parental home, it may do so only upon convincing proof that the parent is an unfit parent, demonstrably incapable of providing an appropriate home for his or her child. In re L.S., 147 Vt. 36, 509 A.2d 1017 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Before a child may be removed from the parental home at the dispositional stage, there must be convincing proof and findings that the parents are unfit and demonstrably incapable of providing an appropriate home, and that separation is necessary for the child's welfare or in the interest of public safety. In re M.B., 147 Vt. 41, 509 A.2d 1014 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        For a juvenile court to justify separation of a child from the parents in the dispositional phase of proceedings following a determination that the child is in need of care and supervision, it must demonstrate that the separation is necessary for the child's welfare or in the interests of public safety; to do so, the court must consider the relative merits of allowing the child to remain with the parents. In re T.L.S., 144 Vt. 536, 481 A.2d 1037 (1984).

         5. Termination of parental rights.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The polestar in disposition proceedings is the best interests of the child, considering the criteria enumerated in
        §
        5540 of this title and the most important of those statutory factors when considering termination of parental rights is the likelihood that parent will be able to resume parental duties within a reasonable time. In re B.M., 165 Vt. 194, 679 A.2d 891 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where father had abused wife, which was a significant reason the children were placed in state custody, and where, for more than 18 months, the father did not take advantage of the services that the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services made available to him, nor did he follow through with counseling, there was no error in terminating father's parental rights at the initial disposition of the parental termination hearing. In re B.M., 165 Vt. 194, 679 A.2d 891 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Most important issue in determining whether child's best interests require termination of parental rights is whether parents will be able to resume their parental duties within reasonable period of time; other factors court must consider include child's relationship with foster parents. In re E.B., 158 Vt. 8, 603 A.2d 373 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure of CHINS children's foster parents to be chosen by SRS as adoptive parents in termination of residual parental rights case did not undermine court's termination decision such that reversal was warranted; termination of residual parental rights does not depend on the existence of an alternative placement. In re E.B., 158 Vt. 8, 603 A.2d 373 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        The juvenile court may terminate all parental rights in a proceeding to determine if a child is in need of care or supervision if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that it is in the best interests of the child as determined by consideration of factors, the most important of which is whether the parent will be able to resume his parental duties within a reasonable time.

        Where no request was made of court which terminated mother's parental rights so have a guardian ad litem appointed for her, the court addressed an inquiry to the mother to assure itself that she understood the nature and ramifications of the proceedings, and the record revealed no evidence which would have put the court on notice that she lacked the capacity to understand the nature of the proceedings, the court had no responsibility, sua sponte, to appoint a guardian ad litem for her.

       <p>
        Before a court may take action in contravention of a parent's right to relate to his or her child free from governmental intervention, it must have convincing proof that he or she is an unfit parent demonstrably incapable of providing an appropriate home for his or her child. In re B.L., 145 Vt. 586, 494 A.2d 145 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a child neglect hearing on the merits, a psychiatric report on mother, considered by the court even though its maker is not available for cross-examination, is inadmissible hearsay, for parties to a juvenile proceeding have the right of cross-examination; but if the merits have been decided and a disposition hearing is in progress, the report is admissible. In re M.P., 133 Vt. 144, 333 A.2d 116 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, in finding child neglected, court relied on hearsay psychiatric report on mother, the doctor not having been available for cross-examination, and the findings other than the report did not support a conclusion of neglect, the mother did not receive full due process and order transferring all parental rights to charity organization with no adoption limitation would be reversed.

        Family court's decision to transfer custody of child to SRS was supported by father's history of removing child from residential treatment and father's continued commitment to a home placement; because interruption in treatment would be detrimental to child, transfer of custody to SRS was necessary for best interests of child.

        At a permanency hearing under this section, the party seeking to modify the previous disposition order has the burden of showing changed circumstances. In re L.S., 172 Vt. 549, 772 A.2d 1077 (mem.) (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where Social and Rehabilitation Services (SRS) sought to modify a previous disposition order, which transferred custody to SRS and accepted and approved a case plan with a goal of reunification with mother, SRS had the burden of showing changed circumstances and showing that a modification of the order was in the best interests of the children, and, thus, the family court erred by placing the burden of showing changed circumstances upon mother when SRS sought to change the case plan goal to long-term foster care. In re L.S., 172 Vt. 549, 772 A.2d 1077 (mem.) (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (d) of this section indicates that long-term foster care is the least favorable placement, thus, Social and Rehabilitation Services had the burden first of showing changed circumstances and then of showing a compelling reason why it is not in the best interest of children to return to their mother or to have residual parental rights terminated. In re L.S., 172 Vt. 549, 772 A.2d 1077 (mem.) (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is well settled that the family court must conduct a two-step analysis whenever it considers modifying an existing disposition order relative to termination of residual parental rights:
    (1) the court must find a substantial change in material circumstances and, (2) if a substantial change in material circumstances is established, the court then must determine whether the best interests of the children require termination; this analysis is required whether the court is considering a modification during a dispositional review or during a hearing on a motion to modify disposition. In re S.M., 163 Vt. 136, 655 A.2d 726 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether to terminate residual parental rights, a substantial change in material circumstances is most often found when a parent's ability to care properly for a child has either stagnated or deteriorated over the passage of time; although stagnation may be found when the parent has made no improvement over time, some improvement will not preclude a finding that the parent's capacity to care for the child has, indeed, stagnated. In re S.M., 163 Vt. 136, 655 A.2d 726 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        In evaluating a parent's parenting skills over time in order to determine whether residual parental rights should be terminated, the central question is whether the improvement in parenting substantially conformed with the expectations at the time of the children in need of care and supervision adjudication and with Social and Rehabilitation Services' case plan; if the parent's progress meets the expectations, there is no change of circumstances, but if the improvement does not substantially conform with the established expectations, then the court may find a change of circumstances and proceed to the second prong of the inquiry - whether termination is in the children's best interests. In re S.M., 163 Vt. 136, 655 A.2d 726 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        In any termination of parental rights proceeding, the family court must examine the circumstances of each parent individually. In re S.M., 163 Vt. 136, 655 A.2d 726 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        In termination of parental rights proceeding, it was error for the family court to decline addressing mother's circumstances because, although one parent's improvement may prevent the court from finding a substantial change in material circumstances, the other parent's capacity may have stagnated or deteriorated, thus meeting the change-of-circumstances test and requiring a further inquiry into the best interests of the child. In re S.M., 163 Vt. 136, 655 A.2d 726 (1994).

        At statutorily mandated 18-month reviews of disposition orders in which minors are determined to be in need of care or supervision (CHINS), the proponent of any modification in the disposition bears the burden to show that it is warranted by changed circumstances.

         4. Termination of residual parental rights.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        A two-step analysis is required in determining whether to terminate residual parental rights: first, to modify an existing disposition order, the court must find that changed circumstances so require in the best interest of the child, and the proponent of the modification must show the change to be a substantial change in material circumstances so as to warrant modification; second, the court must determine whether the best interests of the child, as set forth by statute, require that all parental rights and responsibilities be terminated. In re M.M., 159 Vt. 517, 621 A.2d 1276 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court can consider termination of residual parental rights at a review proceeding under this section. In re J.R., 153 Vt. 85, 570 A.2d 154 (1989).

        Court considering termination of residual parental rights at a review proceeding under this section must find a substantial change in material circumstances, and must find that best interests of child requires termination. In re J.R., 153 Vt. 85, 570 A.2d 154 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Clear and convincing evidence supported termination of residual parental rights at a review proceeding under this section, based on passage of time with no improvement in parental capacity, i.e., stagnation, that had occurred since disposition order.

        Although due process requires imposition of clear and convincing evidence standard where State seeks termination of parental rights, proof by a preponderance of the evidence is sufficient to show that there has been a substantial change in circumstances and that the best interests of the child warrant amendment, modification, or vacation of a termination order, unless there has been an intervening adoption of the child, bringing into picture new set of parents whose due process rights must be considered.

         4. Changed circumstances.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where the plan of the Department for Children and Families was not working for the juvenile, and something had to be done to ensure that he received the services he needs, the juvenile's lack of progress in meeting the case plan's goals supported the court's findings that the statutorily required change of circumstances had occurred since the original disposition order. In re J.M., 178 Vt. 591, 878 A.2d 293 (mem.) (June 9, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Clear and convincing evidence supported family court's finding of substantial change in material circumstances based on mother's stagnation, as well as court's determination that terminating mother's parental rights was in children's best interest. In re A.W., 167 Vt. 601, 708 A.2d 910 (mem.) (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        A child disposition order may be modified at any time on petition of a party, or on the court's own initiative, on the ground that changed circumstances so require in the best interests of the child. In re B.B., 159 Vt. 584, 621 A.2d 1270 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        A substantial change in material circumstances warranting termination of parental rights is most often found when the parent's ability to care properly for the child has either stagnated or deteriorated; stagnation can be shown by the passage of time with no improvement in parental capacity to care properly for the child. In re J.M., 160 Vt. 146, 624 A.2d 362 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the State seeks modification of a juvenile case plan, the court may find a substantial change in material circumstances based on "stagnation." In re S.R., 157 Vt. 417, 599 A.2d 364 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        At modification of parental rights hearing, consideration of the preadoptive home did not violate father's fundamental right to care for his juvenile daughter in the context of the family since court first found a change in material circumstances based on stagnation of the parents' ability to properly care for juvenile, and only then did court consider the relationship between juvenile and her foster parents, a factor which State statute requires court to consider, in determining whether modification was in the best interest of juvenile. In re S.R., 157 Vt. 417, 599 A.2d 364 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mother's lack of progress with substance abuse counseling and deterioration of her condition constituted changed circumstances sufficient to support modification of disposition order under this section and transfer of residual parental rights to Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services without limitation as to adoption. In re C.L., 151 Vt. 480, 563 A.2d 241 (1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1026, 110 S. Ct. 732, 107 L. Ed. 2d 751 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where serious, life threatening injuries have been inflicted upon one child, the juvenile court will not be required to wait until further injuries are inflicted upon its sibling, previously also a victim of child abuse, in order to conclude that a substantial change in material circumstances has occurred as to that sibling and modify a disposition order pursuant to subsection (a) of this section. In re D.P., 147 Vt. 26, 510 A.2d 967 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether there were grounds to modify previous order regarding children in need of care and supervision, court could use time period prior to previous order in conjunction with time period after it to decide whether there was the requisite change of circumstances since the previous order: In re G.V., 136 Vt. 499, 394 A.2d 1126 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        In proceeding to modify order placing two children in need of care and supervision in custody of the State, seeking transfer of residual parental rights to the State, court was justified in finding changed circumstances and granting the transfer where there was a pattern of such severe and constant family instability that it could be said to come within the ambit of stagnation coupled with a prospective inability for improvement, consisting, inter alia, of a five-child family, unemployed father, lack of stability and tranquility in the home, unwillingness of parents to provide the two children's basic needs, four separations and reconciliations of the parents, a moving of the family twice, lack of success by agencies attempting to help, and parents unwilling to change their destructive relationship. In re G.V., 136 Vt. 499, 394 A.2d 1126 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        To establish a substantial change in material circumstances, which along with showing that the modification will be in the best interests of the child are the requirements for modification of an existing juvenile court order and taking a child away from its parents for lack of proper care and supervision, it must be shown that there has been deterioration in the living circumstances of the parents, who have the obligation to correct the circumstances, or that there exists stagnation coupled with a prospective inability for improvement. In re G.V., 136 Vt. 499, 394 A.2d 1126 (1978).

       <p>
        On petition to modify disposition order which placed legal custody of child in Commissioner of Social and Rehabilitation Services, factors relied upon by the father in his contention that he was the person most suited to have custody of the child, either were not changes from the time of the disposition order; or, if they were changes, they did not rise to being substantial changes in material circumstances. In re R.F., 135 Vt. 275, 376 A.2d 38 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Change in the child's placement, unlike a change in legal custody, is not sufficient, standing alone, to warrant modification of court's disposition order. In re R.F., 135 Vt. 275, 376 A.2d 38 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Contention that requisite change in material circumstances occurred when Commissioner of Social and Rehabilitation Services changed placement of child from child's mother to foster home, while of practical import, had minimal legal significance for purposes of father's petition seeking modification of disposition order placing child in legal custody of Commissioner. In re R.F., 135 Vt. 275, 376 A.2d 38 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where record indicated that father was visiting his child four to six times a week from time of disposition order placing child in custody or Commissioner of Social and Rehabilitation Services to time of petition for modification, substantial change in material circumstances was not necessarily established. In re R.F., 135 Vt. 275, 376 A.2d 38 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Change of circumstances necessary before a court order regarding a juvenile may be modified must be a substantial change in material circumstances. In re J.&J.W., 134 Vt. 480, 365 A.2d 521 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        That mother whose children had three years earlier been committed to the care and custody of the State had not improved in the psychological condition which was in part the reason for the commitment, and that the children did not have a psychological mother-child relationship with her, was not grounds for terminating her parental rights on ground of changed circumstances. In re J.&J.W., 134 Vt. 480, 365 A.2d 521 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        That primary psychological relationship of children committed to care and custody of the State laid with person other than the mother and the psychological parent-child relationship had been lost was not, standing alone, ground for terminating parental rights on ground of substantial change in material circumstances. In re J.&J.W., 134 Vt. 480, 365 A.2d 521 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where mother's psychological unpreparedness to care for children had continued for the three years since they had been placed in State's care and custody, but she visited the children as often as the State allowed, had established a stable marriage, prepared accommodations for anticipated long visits by the children, continued a regular medical treatment plan, and was employed part-time in a position which in part involved supervision of children, any apparent change was in favor of improved parental circumstances, not one showing stagnation. In re J.&J.W., 134 Vt. 480, 365 A.2d 521 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where custody and guardianship of three children had been transferred from mother to the State upon a finding that she was deficient in the necessary abilities to cope with parental duties and could not provide the stimulation, understanding, and judgment necessary to care for her children, fact that there was no improvement in the next three years in her parental ability and capacity was grounds for modifying the original order on the basis of a change of circumstances and transferring the mother's residual parental rights and responsibilities to the state.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        A termination petition does not commence an entirely new proceeding because there is a child in need of care or supervision (CHINS) proceeding pending, and therefore the original process demanding the appearance of the parents is not necessary. Once a CHINS proceeding has commenced, and the parties have been made aware of the proceeding and have either obtained, or had an opportunity to obtain counsel, it is no longer necessary to issue original process, including a summons, requiring their presence and advising them to obtain counsel. In re M.T., 180 Vt. 643, 912 A.2d 456 (mem.) (November 7, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (a) of this section and
        §§
        5519-5520 of this title require the family court to provide direct notice of a pending termination petition and hearing to the parents of children who are the subject of the petition, in addition to the parents' attorneys. Because that was not done, a termination order was required to be reversed and the matter remanded for further proceedings. In re M.T., 180 Vt. 643, 912 A.2d 456 (mem.) (November 7, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not improperly allow the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services to recommend termination of mother's parental rights in alleged violation of an oral agreement under which she admitted her child was a child in need of care or supervision. Whether or not this agreement was violated, it was subject to modification for changed circumstances. Agreements involving the interests of children are subject to the overriding supervision of the family court to protect the children's interests. In re B.S., 166 Vt. 345, 693 A.2d 716 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a court considers terminating parental rights under
        §
        5532(a) of this title it must conduct a two-step analysis:
    first, the court must find whether there has been a substantial change in material circumstances; second, it must decide whether the best interests of the child require termination of parental rights. In re Cr. M., 163 Vt. 542, 659 A.2d 1159 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        A substantial change in material circumstances warranting termination of parental rights is most often found when the parent's ability to care properly for the child has either stagnated or deteriorated over the passage of time, stagnation being shown by the passage of time with no improvement in parental capacity to care properly for the child. In re Cr. M., 163 Vt. 542, 659 A.2d 1159 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the court decides to terminate parental rights, its findings must be supported by clear and convincing evidence, and if so supported they will withstand review in the Supreme Court unless they are clearly erroneous. In re Cr. M., 163 Vt. 542, 659 A.2d 1159 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mother's argument that Social and Rehabilitation Services (SRS) case plan did not address her needs as a battered woman was without merit where there was strong support in the record that SRS's case plans recognized the mother's victimization, attempted to safeguard her rights, and maximized her chances of resuming the parental role in that they provided for SRS support and monitoring, ongoing medical exams, individual and family mental health counseling, and assistance from a local family services agency, including temporary housing and abuse counseling and where the record also indicated that SRS responded immediately to the mother's changing needs following an August 1992 battering episode and supported her recovery efforts through the fall. In re Cr. M., 163 Vt. 542, 659 A.2d 1159 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a proceeding to terminate parental rights, the court's conclusion that there was a substantial change in circumstances based on stagnation was not erroneous where the court found that the mother had been abused in the past, had renounced the abuse, had been unable to protect herself from her husband's violent behavior, and had been unwilling to seek assistance; that neither parent had been willing to accept homemaking or child care services, and that neither parent was willing to accept employment counseling; and that the mother's progress was hindered by her recurring psychotic episodes and an untreated mental disorder. In re Cr. M., 163 Vt. 542, 659 A.2d 1159 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mother could not challenge family court's decision to terminate parental rights by assigning primary blame for the family's dysfunction to the father since, even if one parent contributes more to the family's breakdown than the other parent, the controlling standard under 33 V.S.A.
        §
        5532(a) is the best interests of the child, not the fault of the parent. In re Cr. M., 163 Vt. 542, 659 A.2d 1159 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Notwithstanding father's argument to the contrary, family court did not have a duty under 33 V.S.A.
        §
        5532(a) to treat the issue of visitation separately from the issue of termination of parental rights and responsibilities and to make a separate finding by clear and convincing evidence that visitation should be denied since visitation is a residual parental right and the termination of such rights necessarily eliminates the parent's right to visit the child. In re Cr. M., 163 Vt. 542, 659 A.2d 1159 (1995).

        When termination of parental rights is sought,
        §
        5532(a) of this title requires the court to conduct a two-step analysis: first, the court must find that there has been a substantial change in material circumstances; and second, the court must find that the best interests of the juvenile require termination of parental rights; such findings must be supported by clear and convincing evidence and will withstand review unless they are clearly erroneous. In re B.W., 162 Vt. 287, 648 A.2d 652 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of parental rights at a modification proceeding requires a two-step analysis; the court must find a substantial change in material circumstances warranting modification, and that the best interests of the juvenile requires termination of parental rights. In re J.M., 160 Vt. 146, 624 A.2d 362 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a proceeding to terminate parental rights, trial court first must conclude that a substantial change in material circumstances has occurred; if this threshold criterion is met, court then determines whether termination of parental rights is in the best interest of the child. In re H.S., 161 Vt. 83, 632 A.2d 1106 (1993).

        Proper standard of proof on motion to modify or vacate an order to terminate parental rights is preponderance of the evidence. In re T.E., 155 Vt. 172, 582 A.2d 160 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Decision of trial court denying mother's motion to modify and vacate order terminating parental rights would stand; any error by trial court in applying standard of clear and convincing evidence in lieu of preponderance of the evidence standard was harmless where evidence supported denial of motions under either standard.

       <p>
        A juvenile court considering a petition for modification of a disposition order, wherein the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services is seeking custody without limitations as to adoption, must consider the legislative criteria set forth in section 667 [now
        §
        5540] of this title for determining the child's best interest. In re J.J., 143 Vt. 1, 458 A.2d 1129 (1983).

       <p>
        Subsection (a) of this section applies to all orders, including those that terminate residual parental rights. In re J.H., 144 Vt. 1, 470 A.2d 1182 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the juvenile court dismissed a motion for relief from prior court orders which had terminated parental rights on the basis of its finding that in a petition to modify the orders also filed by the parents they had argued that there was no mistake or fraud in the orders, since the language relied on by the court did not come from the petition to modify but rather from counsel's supporting memorandum discussing the motion for relief, the parents, in their accompanying affidavit, stated that they had 'felt pressured' when they relinquished their rights, the children were residing in foster care and no adoption proceedings had been commenced on their behalf, the dismissal of the motion would be reversed. In re J.H., 144 Vt. 1, 470 A.2d 1182 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        When reviewing causes in which termination of residual parental rights in children is sought, whether the proceedings be original or for modification of a prior order, Supreme Court will proceed with great caution, in view of the awesome power involved and the concern expressed by the Legislature in the preservation of the family unit. In re G.V., 136 Vt. 499, 394 A.2d 1126 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        If parental rights over a neglected child were to be terminated subsequent to custody of child having been placed in the Commissioner of Social Welfare, the parental condition either must have deteriorated or must have been stagnant with a prospective inability for improvement and where the parental condition had improved, severance of rights was in error. In re J.A.S., 135 Vt. 243, 373 A.2d 558 (1977).

       <p>
        Where Social and Rehabilitation Services (SRS) sought to modify a previous disposition order, which transferred custody to SRS and accepted and approved a case plan with a goal of reunification with mother, SRS had the burden of showing changed circumstances and showing that a modification of the order was in the best interests of the children, and, thus, the family court erred by placing the burden of showing changed circumstances upon mother when SRS sought to change the case plan goal to long-term foster care. In re L.S., 172 Vt. 549, 772 A.2d 1077 (mem.) (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        At 18-month review hearing pursuant to disposition order placing child in need of care or supervision (CHINS) in custody of the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services (SRS) in which mother who had originally stipulated to SRS custody now sought custody of the child, the trial court erred in allocating to SRS the burden of demonstrating parental unfitness, and remand was required for determination of whether parent met burden to show changed circumstances warranting modification of the disposition.

        In termination of parental rights at modification proceeding, court's conclusion that father was incapable of properly caring for his juvenile daughter was supported by credible evidence where court found that father's alcohol problem, including frequent arguments and occasional separations, and father's failure to acknowledge juvenile mother's Munchausen syndrome by proxy posed a direct threat to the health and safety of juvenile, and that that resulting stress had a negative impact of the juvenile; additionally, court's finding of lack of safety in the home and lack of parental ability to care properly for juvenile were equally attributable to the father and the mother.

        The juvenile justice system serves rehabilitative rather than punitive goals; in order to make change and growth possible, the delinquent is protected from the stigma of his misconduct by the confidentiality of juvenile proceedings, records, and files.

        Compelling interest of State in confidentiality of juvenile records overrode any compelling need of former deputy State prosecutor for access to such records, where former prosecutor desired to use juvenile records in her defense of a civil rights action brought against her personally by the mother of juvenile, at least where former prosecutor failed to show she had exhausted all other avenues of relief, and failed to show any particularized need for the material.

        5531 of this title, the court must consider the best interests of the child under the factors enumerated under this section. In re L.S., 172 Vt. 549, 772 A.2d 1077 (mem.) (2001).

       <p>
        While parental improvement is a factor to consider when determining whether to sever parental rights of a child who has been found to be in need of care and supervision on the basis of abandonment, the real test is whether there is a reasonable possibility of reuniting parent and child within a reasonable period of time. In re J.J., 143 Vt. 1, 458 A.2d 1129 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Juvenile court did not err in severing parental right of father, on the ground that there was no likelihood that he would be able to resume parental responsibilities within a reasonable period of time, where the record indicated that the father's past had been volatile, his present living arrangement was not appropriate for children, he was unemployed, had not contributed monetary support for the children since they had been committed to the custody of the State six years earlier, and expressed an unwillingness to do so and his mental health counselor testified that she did not know if the father would ever be in a position to take custody.

         §
        </span>

        To sever parental rights to a neglected child completely, temporary placement outside the home must be inadequate to serve the best interests of the child, and a reasonable possibility of family restoration within a reasonable time will operate to bar total termination of parental rights.

       <p>
        Family court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that termination of father's residual parental rights was in the child's best interests where it was shown that he bore sole responsibility for his frequent incarceration, his failure to maintain consistent contact with the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services, and his lack of a bond with the child. In re K.F., 176 Vt. 636, 852 A.2d 584 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court acted within its discretion in terminating mother's parental rights with respect to her 16-year-old daughter, notwithstanding the daughter's stated opposition to termination and her desire to reunite with her mother. In re S.B., 174 Vt. 427, 800 A.2d 4476 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any assistance the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services (SRS) provided to troubled parents is a factor in determining whether SRS met its burden of showing, in a parental termination proceeding, that a parent is unlikely to be able to resume parental duties within a reasonable period of time. In re J.T., 166 Vt. 173, 693 A.2d 283 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        In evaluating a parent's parenting skills over time in order to determine whether residual parental rights should be terminated, the central question is whether the improvement in parenting substantially conformed with the expectations at the time of the children in need of care and supervision adjudication and with Social and Rehabilitation Services' case plan; if the parent's progress meets the expectations, there is no change of circumstances, but if the improvement does not substantially conform with the established expectations, then the court may find a change of circumstances and proceed to the second prong of the inquiry - whether termination is in the children's best interests. In re S.M., 163 Vt. 136, 655 A.2d 726 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is well settled that the family court must conduct a two-step analysis whenever it considers modifying an existing disposition order relative to termination of residual parental rights:
    (1) the court must find a substantial change in material circumstances and, (2) if a substantial change in material circumstances is established, the court then must determine whether the best interests of the children require termination; this analysis is required whether the court is considering a modification during a dispositional review or during a hearing on a motion to modify disposition. In re S.M., 163 Vt. 136, 655 A.2d 726 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        In termination of parental rights proceeding, it was error for the family court to decline addressing mother's circumstances because, although one parent's improvement may prevent the court from finding a substantial change in material circumstances, the other parent's capacity may have stagnated or deteriorated, thus meeting the change-of-circumstances test and requiring a further inquiry into the best interests of the child. In re S.M., 163 Vt. 136, 655 A.2d 726 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        In any termination of parental rights proceeding, the family court must examine the circumstances of each parent individually. In re S.M., 163 Vt. 136, 655 A.2d 726 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public policy does not dictate that the parent-child bond be maintained regardless of the cost to the child, and
        §
        5540 of this title recognizes that severance of that bond may be in the child's best interest. In re M.B., 162 Vt. 229, 647 A.2d 1001, cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1004, 115 S. Ct. 519, 130 L. Ed. 2d 424 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        A two-step analysis is required in determining whether to terminate residual parental rights: first, to modify an existing disposition order, the court must find that changed circumstances so require in the best interest of the child, and the proponent of the modification must show the change to be a substantial change in material circumstances so as to warrant modification; second, the court must determine whether the best interests of the child, as set forth by statute, require that all parental rights and responsibilities be terminated. In re M.M., 159 Vt. 517, 621 A.2d 1276 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of parental rights at a modification proceeding requires a two-step analysis; the court must find a substantial change in material circumstances warranting modification, and that the best interests of the juvenile requires termination of parental rights. In re J.M., 160 Vt. 146, 624 A.2d 362 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        A court may terminate parental rights at a modification hearing if it finds that there has been a substantial change in material circumstances since the disposition order and that termination is in the child's best interests. In re D.B., 161 Vt. 217, 635 A.2d 1207 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        The juvenile court may terminate all parental rights and responsibilities only if it is in the best interests of the child. In re L.A., 154 Vt. 147, 574 A.2d 782 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        In proceeding to terminate parental rights, the most critical factor in determining a child's best interests is whether the parent will be able to resume his parental duties within a reasonable period of time. In re R.W., 154 Vt. 649, 577 A.2d 253 (mem.) (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The juvenile court may terminate all parental rights in a proceeding to determine if a child is in need of care or supervision if the court finds by clear and convincing evidence that it's in the best interests of the child as determined by consideration of statutory factors, the most important of which is whether the parent will be able to resume his parental duties within a reasonable time. In re G.S., 153 Vt. 651, 572 A.2d 1350 (mem.) (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Juvenile court properly terminated mother's parental rights where findings were replete with facts sufficient to find mother would not be able to resume her parental duties within a reasonable time. In re K.B., 154 Vt. 647, 577 A.2d 277 (mem.) (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where court concluded that the mother and child had "no positive interaction whatsoever" but that the interactions between child and her foster parents had been positive; that child adjusted well to her foster home and school; that it was "highly unlikely" that parent could resume parental duties within a reasonable period of time; and that parent played no constructive role in child's welfare, court could conclude that parent was unfit and demonstrably incapable of providing an appropriate home. In re R.B., 152 Vt. 415, 566 A.2d 1310 (1989), cert. denied, Appleby v. Young, 493 U.S. 1086, 110 S. Ct. 1151, 107 L. Ed. 2d 1055 (1990).

       <p>
        Termination of father's parental rights was supported by finding that, due to lack of significant contact between children and father and positive interaction between children and their foster parents, it was unlikely that father would be able to resume parental duties within a reasonable period of time. In re C.H., 170 Vt. 603, 749 A.2d 20 (mem.) (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court did not err in terminating father's parental rights; father was unable to resume his parental duties within a reasonable time, where he claimed all of his family's problems were attributable to mother's epilepsy, he attended only 10 to 12 anger management sessions over two-and-a-half years, he never engaged in couples counseling with mother or in sexual abuse counseling with child, he yelled and swore at social worker in front of children during visitations and yelled directives at children, and he had poor impulse control and a low tolerance for frustration. In re D.C., 168 Vt. 1, 712 A.2d 902 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court did not err in terminating mother's parental rights, despite mother's substantial progress in dealing with her psychological difficulties; primary consideration is whether parent will be able to resume parental duties within a reasonable period of time, not merely whether there has been identifiable progress since child was originally removed from household. In re J.B., 167 Vt. 637, 712 A.2d 895 (mem.) (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of residual parental rights at a modification hearing requires the court to determine whether the best interest of the child requires termination of all parental rights, in light of the criteria set out in this section, and the critical factor in this determination is whether the natural parent will be able to resume parental duties within a reasonable time. A conclusion that the parent will be unlikely to resume parental duties within a reasonable time, thus justifying termination of parental rights, must be supported by clear and convincing evidence. In re B.M., 165 Vt. 331, 682 A.2d 477 (1996).

        Where the father made substantial progress towards reunification with his child but his progress did not occur within a reasonable time for the child's needs, the court properly terminated his parental rights, because in a termination-of-parental-rights case the focus is on the future of the parent-child relationship and the court considers the parent's prospective ability to parent the child and not just the past circumstances that have affected the parent-child relationship. In re B.M., 165 Vt. 331, 682 A.2d 477 (1996).

        The polestar in disposition proceedings is the best interests of the child, considering the criteria enumerated in this section, and the most important of those statutory factors when considering termination of parental rights is the likelihood that the parent will be able to resume parental duties within a reasonable time. In re B.M., 165 Vt. 194, 679 A.2d 891 (1996).
       </p>

        Where father had abused wife, which was a significant reason the children were placed in State custody, and where, for more than 18 months, the father did not take advantage of the services that the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services made available to him, nor did he follow through with counseling, there was no error in terminating father's parental rights at the initial disposition of the parental termination hearing. In re B.M., 165 Vt. 194, 679 A.2d 891 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        The best interests of the children must be considered in accordance with the four criteria set forth in
        §
        5540 of this title: (1) The interaction and interrelationship of the child with his natural parents, his foster parents if any, his siblings, and any other person who may significantly affect the child's best interests; (2) The child's adjustment to his home, school, and community; (3) The likelihood that the natural parent will be able to resume his parental duties within a reasonable period of time; and (4) Whether the natural parent has played and continues to play a constructive role, including personal contact and demonstrated love and affection, in the child's welfare; the most important of the four criteria is the third, concerning resumption of parental duties. In re M.B., 162 Vt. 229, 647 A.2d 1001, cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1004, 115 S. Ct. 519, 130 L. Ed. 2d 424 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        To justify termination, the trial court must find, by clear and convincing evidence, that termination is in the best interests of the child, and, in particular, whether the parent will be able to resume parental duties within a reasonable period of time. In re M.B., 162 Vt. 229, 647 A.2d 1001, cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1004, 115 S. Ct. 519, 130 L. Ed. 2d 424 (1994).

        The most critical factor in determining whether a minor child's best interests mandate the termination of all parental rights and responsibilities is whether the parent will be able to resume her parental duties within a reasonable time. In re M.M., 159 Vt. 517, 621 A.2d 1276 (1993).
       </p>

        In a proceeding for termination of all parental rights and responsibilities, the parent's inability to resume parental duties within a reasonable time must be shown by clear and convincing evidence. In re M.M., 159 Vt. 517, 621 A.2d 1276 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a proceeding to terminate parental rights and responsibilities, trial court did not misinterpret requirement of inability to resume parental duties within reasonable time where a reasonable time already had passed, parent was still at least 12 to 18 months of counselling away from even being in a position to be considered for reunification, and despite some progress, each gain was followed by subsequent stagnation or deterioration.

        Most important issue in determining whether child's best interests require termination of parental rights is whether parents will be able to resume their parental duties within reasonable period of time; other factors court must consider include child's relationship with foster parents.

       <p>
        Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services did not violate parents' constitutional right to travel and did not cause conditions which necessitated termination of residual parental rights by failing to work with parents when they were out of State, since parents' voluntary move out of state conflicted with their previous commitment to stable employment and housing, regular visits with the children, and attendance at counseling. In re E.B., 158 Vt. 8, 603 A.2d 373 (1992).

        Clear and convincing evidence supported family court's finding of substantial change in material circumstances based on mother's stagnation, as well as court's determination that terminating mother's parental rights was in children's best interest. In re A.W., 167 Vt. 601, 708 A.2d 910 (mem.) (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a termination-of-parental-rights case, although the father had made significant parental improvement while the case was proceeding, the later improvement did not erase the earlier period of stagnation from which the child suffered, and the question when determining if the father's parental rights should be terminated was whether the improvement substantially conformed with the expectations at the time of the original adjudication and with the case plan of the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services. In re B.M., 165 Vt. 331, 682 A.2d 477 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether to terminate residual parental rights, a substantial change in material circumstances is most often found when a parent's ability to care properly for a child has either stagnated or deteriorated over the passage of time; although stagnation may be found when the parent has made no improvement over time, some improvement will not preclude a finding that the parent's capacity to care for the child has, indeed, stagnated. In re S.M., 163 Vt. 136, 655 A.2d 726 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        The decision to terminate parental rights is committed to the discretion of the family court, and requires a threshold determination that a substantial change in material circumstances has occurred; if the change in circumstances has been established, the court may order termination only upon concluding that severance of the parent-child bond is in the best interest of the child. In re D.M., 162 Vt. 33, 641 A.2d 774 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Stagnation of unacceptable situation is sufficient to constitute material change in circumstances sufficient to terminate parental rights at modification proceeding. In re M.M., 159 Vt. 41, 613 A.2d 713 (1992).

        In modification proceeding for termination of residual parental rights, family court did not err in concluding that parental improvement had come too late and that best interests of child were served by termination of parental relations; foster parents had become child's psychological parents, biological parents remained unable to care for child, and degree of improvement by biological parents would not allow reunification within time to prevent very significant harm to child, who was particularly fragile and vulnerable. In re J.M., 160 Vt. 146, 624 A.2d 362 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure of CHINS children's foster parents to be chosen by SRS as adoptive parents in termination of residual parental rights case did not undermine court's termination decision such that reversal was warranted; termination of residual parental rights does not depend on the existence of an alternative placement.

        Where it was shown that the parents had ample time and opportunity to address the significant problems that led to their children being taken from them, but instead of making an effort to address those problems, they denied having any problem, refused services, and engaged in a pattern of behavior that was harmful to their children, the family court's decision to maintain the status quo did not follow from its findings, which overwhelmingly demonstrated that termination of parental rights was in the children's best interests. In re J.F., 180 Vt. 583, 904 A.2d 1209 (mem.) (June 5, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the case of an unwed biological father, the trial court did not err in terminating his parental rights where the evidence showed that even a minimal level of interest would have alerted him to the fact of mother's pregnancy and the possibility that he was the father, and that he missed his initial paternity test, expressed an initial interest in voluntarily relinquishing his parental rights, and delayed for two months after discovering his paternity to assert any custodial rights. In re C.L., 178 Vt. 558, 878 A.2d 207 (mem.) (March 15, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where father and mother conceded that they could not care for their child and would not be able to do so in the foreseeable future, the evidence overwhelmingly supported the court's determination that the parents had failed to play a constructive role in the child's life and that they would be unable to resume parental duties within a reasonable time. In re T.T., 178 Vt. 496, 872 A.2d 334 (mem.) (February 22, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutory criteria supported the family court's termination order where the court found that foster parents wanted to provide the child with the permanence he needed, while still maintaining a relationship between him, his siblings, and his grandfather, and, in contrast, the child's relationship with his grandfather and siblings was more in the nature of playmates rather than family. In re T.T., 178 Vt. 496, 872 A.2d 334 (mem.) (February 22, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Termination of father's parental right was justified based on evidence that supported the family court's finding that he had shown little improvement in his parenting ability during the 15 months since his child had been adjudicated a child in need of care and supervision. In re S.W., 176 Vt. 517, 833 A.2d 879 (mem.) (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court terminating mother's parental rights did not err by giving undue weight to psychological role foster parents had come to play in juvenile's life; court considered and related evidence to all applicable statutory factors, and court was clear that lodestar criterion was whether mother would be able to resume parental duties within reasonable period of time. In re J.B., 167 Vt. 637, 712 A.2d 895 (mem.) (1998).

       <p>
        Although father argued that the court, in a parental termination proceeding, erred in failing to make specific findings concerning whether the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services (SRS) made reasonable efforts to assist him, under this section the court is required to make specific findings on four statutory considerations, but whether SRS made reasonable efforts to assist the parents is not one of them. In re J.T., 166 Vt. 173, 693 A.2d 283 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court's findings, in a parental termination proceeding, on the services offered to father and his lack of benefit from the programs supported its conclusion that father failed to recognize and address deficiencies in his own parenting skills, and that, even if he remained separated from the mother, he would be unable to resume parenting within a reasonable period of time. In re J.T., 166 Vt. 173, 693 A.2d 283 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a parental termination proceeding, where supervised visits with the children were an opportunity for both parents to show improved parenting skills, but father did nothing to curb the rage or reign in the erratic behaviors of mother, and the court found that the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services (SRS) attempted to provide additional services to father, but that he made no effort to revise his work schedule to enable participation, father failed to show these findings to be clearly erroneous.

       </p>
       <p>
        Termination based on psychological testing results suggesting that father's parenting skills were inadequate and that he would not be able to properly care for the child in the immediate or foreseeable future would have been improper in the absence of other evidence; psychological testing may not be the sole basis for an order terminating parental rights.

        The record contains clear and convincing evidence on all the relevant criteria of
        §
        5540 of this title, evidence that supports the termination of the father's parental rights, and the father fails to specify how trial counsel's presumed incompetence prejudiced his case sufficiently to create the reasonable probability of a different outcome.

       </p>
       <p>
        The court was presented with voluminous amounts of evidence that support a finding that termination of parental rights was in the best interest of the child; the daughter herself did not want contact with her father, the daughter was traumatized every time her father came to visit her, and the father, although given every chance, failed in general to improve his parenting skills over a substantial period of time.

       </p>
       <p>
        The father's claim that termination of parental rights was unnecessary was not supported by the record; guided by the criteria in
        §
        5540 of this title, the trial court found by clear and convincing evidence that termination of parental rights was in the best interests of the children to make it possible for them to remain in a stable, nurturing, and safe home environment, free from fear of the unpredictable dislocations that have characterized their lives with their father. In re M.B., 162 Vt. 229, 647 A.2d 1001, cert. denied, 513 U.S. 1004, 115 S. Ct. 519, 130 L. Ed. 2d 424 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Family court's conclusions that termination of parental rights and adoption by children's foster parents was in children's best interests were supported by evidence that the parents were totally unfit to have custody of their children and the likelihood that either parent would be able to resume parental duties within a year was nil.

       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly terminated parental rights of mother at 18-month review proceeding, where it carefully considered and weighed statutory criteria governing review of child-custody decisions; mother's parental rights were terminated, since placement of child in mother's home would risk abuse by mother and her boyfriend, foster home provided nurturing environment, mother lacked parenting skills, with no likelihood that she could resume parental duties within reasonable time period, and mother was disinterested in involvement in child's daily life.

       </p>
       <p>
        At modification of parental rights hearing, consideration of the preadoptive home did not violate father's fundamental right to care for his juvenile daughter in the context of the family since court first found a change in material circumstances based on stagnation of the parents' ability to properly care for juvenile, and only then did court consider the relationship between juvenile and her foster parents, a factor which State statute requires court to consider, in determining whether modification was in the best interest of juvenile.

       <p>
        At modification of parental rights hearing, father's argument that court's consideration of quality of juvenile daughter's preadoptive foster home is irrelevant and violates his constitutional rights was not well founded since this section required court to consider the interaction of the juvenile with foster parents.

        Although the court was required to determine by only a preponderance of the evidence that children were in need of care and supervision, the court found by the higher standard of clear and convincing evidence that one child was without the proper parental care necessary for her physical and emotional well-being and that another child was without the proper parental care necessary for her physical well-being; therefore, the argument that the court could not, in a parental termination proceeding, incorporate findings based on clear and convincing evidence from the children-in-need-of-care-and-supervision proceeding was without merit.

In re J.R., 164 Vt. 267, 668 A.2d 670 (1995).

         12. Findings.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where the family court clearly found and considered that mother had not made sufficient progress in the prior 17 months to support the conclusion that she would be able to parent the child in a reasonable period of time, and this conclusion was supported by the fact that the "reasonableness" of the time period must be judged from the perspective of child - a rapidly developing two-year old who had been in foster care since she was six months old - the opinion as a whole encompassed all the factors required to be considered under this section. In re J.L., Juvenile, 181 Vt. 615, 928 A.2d 474 (mem.) (April 25, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        The family court's findings supported its conclusion that the juvenile's best interests would be met by undergoing rehabilitation at a particular residential program it noted the family's commitment to the juvenile's rehabilitation; his inability to adjust to prior placements; his need for further treatment before his release from Department for Children and Families custody; and the ability of the designated program to meet his important and pressing needs. In re J.M., 178 Vt. 591, 878 A.2d 293 (mem.) (June 9, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not require that children of the same mother be kept together; thus, there is no reason why the question does not fall within the "substantial leeway" accorded the trial court in framing a disposition order. In re B.M., 165 Vt. 194, 679 A.2d 891 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Findings of family court in a modification proceeding to terminate parental rights will withstand review unless clearly erroneous. In re J.M., 160 Vt. 146, 624 A.2d 362 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Juvenile court satisfied requirement of a clear and convincing showing of parental unfitness in termination of residual parental rights case, where, despite not saying exact words, court's findings and conclusions clearly indicated as much. In re E.B., 158 Vt. 8, 603 A.2d 373 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the State seeks modification of a juvenile case plan, the court may find a substantial change in material circumstances based on "stagnation." In re S.R., 157 Vt. 417, 599 A.2d 364 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to determine best interests of children under section 659 [now
        §
        5532] of this title, trial court is not required to make further findings as to continued abuse or neglect of children. In re C.L., 151 Vt. 480, 563 A.2d 241 (1989), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 1026, 110 S. Ct. 732, 107 L. Ed. 2d 751 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        In proceeding for termination of parental rights in children, court need not couch its findings in precise language of this section as long as it is evident that the court fully considered the criteria set forth in the statute. In re G.V., 136 Vt. 499, 394 A.2d 1126 (1978).

         13. Harmless error.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where court concluded that Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services (SRS) had not proven by clear and convincing evidence that termination of mother's parental rights was in best interests of children and solidified status quo of continuing foster care and allowing appropriate visitation, any error was harmless; if court had denied SRS's motion to terminate parental rights, or if motion had never been made, there would have been no difference in children's circumstances, absent decision by SRS to change their placement. In re M.M., 159 Vt. 41, 613 A.2d 713 (1992).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Court reviewing termination of parental rights resulting from a modification proceeding will uphold lower court's findings if supported by clear and convincing evidence, and its conclusions of law if supported by the findings. In re A.W., 167 Vt. 601, 708 A.2d 910 (mem.) (1998).

       <p>
        Interstate Compact on Juveniles is not constitutionally invalid as having been entered into without approval of the United States Congress and State of Vermont was authorized in proceeding on requisition from State of Colorado under the section. In re D.B., 139 Vt. 634, 431 A.2d 498, cert. denied, 454 U.S. 874, 102 S. Ct. 349, 70 L. Ed. 2d 181 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        No potential derogation of the Compact Clause of the United States Constitution appears from the content of the Interstate Compact on Juveniles, which merely provides for an orderly and protective procedure for the return of juveniles who have escaped lawful custody, state or parental, in another state and for agreements between states to supervise juvenile probation as to parolees residing outside the committing state.

       The compacting states to this Interstate Compact recognize that each state is responsible for the proper supervision or return of juveniles, delinquents, and status offenders who are on probation or parole and who have absconded, escaped, or run away from supervision and control and in so doing have endangered their own safety and the safety of others. The compacting states also recognize that each state is responsible for the safe return of juveniles who have run away from home and in so doing have left their state of residence. The compacting states also recognize that Congress, by enacting the Crime Control Act, 4 U.S.C. Section 112 (1965), has authorized and encouraged compacts for cooperative efforts and mutual assistance in the prevention of crime.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Plain language of the statute governing the placement of neglected or unmanageable children affords all neglected and unmanageable children the right to a hearing before being placed out of state. Thus, as a hearing was required for all children, not just those whose parents' rights had not yet been terminated, appellee, whose parents had voluntarily relinquished custody of him, was entitled to a hearing. In re M.C., 209 Vt. 219, 204 A.3d 1123 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Parents are not entitled to a hearing regarding the propriety of out-of-state placement of their child under this section. In re A.K., 153 Vt. 462, 571 A.2d 75 (1990).

         2. Evidence.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Statute governing interstate placement of children requires the court to find that no equivalent facilities are available in Vermont and that the placement is in the child's best interest and will not cause undue hardship. In a child in need of care or supervision (CHINS) case, at least with respect to a child on the cusp of adulthood, in order to establish that a long-term placement in a locked psychiatric residential treatment facility in another state is in a child's best interest, the State must present evidence of an expert evaluation or opinion that the minor has a psychiatric condition and needs long-term, intensive, institutional psychiatric treatment that cannot be provided in a less restrictive environment. In re S.R., - Vt.
    - , 253 A.3d 907 (Mar. 26, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a child had been in Department for Children and Families (DCF) custody for nearly a year prior to the disposition hearing, but DCF did not get a psychiatric evaluation or present any expert testimony whatsoever to support its contention that the child needed to be placed in a locked psychiatric residential treatment facility out of state, and the child objected, remand was required. In re S.R., - Vt.
    - , 253 A.3d 907 (Mar. 26, 2021).

     </h3>
     <p>
      The State of Vermont adopts the following principles for a comprehensive and coordinated system of services and supports for older Vermonters:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t33p05c62s6202ol11">
       Self-determination.
    
    Older Vermonters should be able to direct their own lives as they age so that aging is not something that merely happens to them but a process in which they actively participate. Whatever services, supports, and protections are offered, older Vermonters deserve dignity and respect and must be at the core of all decisions affecting their lives, with the opportunity to accept or refuse any offering.
      </li>
      <li id="t33p05c62s6202ol12">
       Safety and protection.
    
    Older Vermonters should be able to live in communities, whether urban or rural, that are safe and secure. Older Vermonters have the right to be free from abuse, neglect, and exploitation, including financial exploitation. As older Vermonters age, their civil and legal rights should be protected, even if their capacity is diminished. Safety and stability should be sought, balanced with their right to self-determination.
      </li>
      <li id="t33p05c62s6202ol13">
       Coordinated and efficient system of services.
    
    Older Vermonters should be able to benefit from a system of services, supports, and protections, including protective services, that is coordinated, equitable, and efficient; includes public and private cross-sector collaboration at the State, regional, and local levels; and avoids duplication while promoting choice, flexibility, and creativity. The system should be easy for individuals and families to access and navigate, including as it relates to major transitions in care. The system should be designed to address the needs and concerns of Older Vermonters and their families during normal times and in the event of a public health crisis, natural disaster, or other widespread emergency situation in this State.
      </li>
      <li id="t33p05c62s6202ol14">
       Financial security.
    
    Older Vermonters should be able to receive an adequate income and have the opportunity to maintain assets for a reasonable quality of life as they age. If older Vermonters want to work, they should be able to seek and maintain employment without fear of discrimination and with any needed accommodations. Older Vermonters should also be able to retire after a lifetime of work, if they so choose, without fear of poverty and isolation.
      </li>
      <li id="t33p05c62s6202ol15">
       Optimal health and wellness.
    
    Older Vermonters should have the opportunity to receive, without discrimination, optimal physical, dental, mental, emotional, and spiritual health through the end of their lives. Holistic options for health, exercise, counseling, and good nutrition should be both affordable and accessible. Access to coordinated, competent, and high-quality care should be provided at all levels and in all settings.
      </li>
      <li id="t33p05c62s6202ol16">
       Social connection and engagement.
    
    Older Vermonters should be free from isolation and loneliness, with affordable and accessible opportunities in their communities for social connectedness, including work, volunteering, lifelong learning, civic engagement, arts, culture, and broadband access and other technologies. Older Vermonters are critical to our local economies and their contributions should be valued by all.
      </li>
      <li id="t33p05c62s6202ol17">
       Housing, transportation, and community design.
    
    Vermont communities should be designed, zoned, and built to support the health, safety, and independence of older Vermonters, with affordable, accessible, appropriate, safe, and service-enriched housing, transportation, and community support options that allow them to age in a variety of settings along the continuum of care and that foster engagement in community life.
      </li>
      <li id="t33p05c62s6202ol18">
       Family caregiver support.
    
    Family caregivers are fundamental to supporting the health and well-being of older Vermonters, and their hard work and contributions should be respected, valued, and supported. Family caregivers of all ages should have affordable access to education, training, counseling, respite, and support that is both coordinated and efficient.

      It is the policy of the State of Vermont to ensure that all residents in every town within the State have access to comprehensive, medically necessary home health services without regard to their ability to pay for those services and to ensure that such services are delivered in an efficient and cost-effective manner, under a regulatory framework designed to control costs and ensure access to high quality home health services based on a model that promotes cooperation and nonduplication of services, rather than unregulated competition.

Those Medicare beneficiaries who are also eligible for Medicaid, known as 'dual-eligibles', routinely turn to Medicaid to pay for the services and supplies they need. Since Medicaid is a joint federal-state program, while Medicare is wholly federal, these Medicare denials have a tremendous impact on the state Medicaid program. Reversing these unjustified Medicare denials will provide Vermont Medicare beneficiaries the benefits to which they are entitled and save the state substantial Medicaid dollars."

This analysis shall be performed only when the composite average rate increase requested by insurers with 5,000 or more lives in the Vermont Medicare supplement insurance policy market exceeds three percent, or when the Commissioner finds that the proposed premium and policy changes will have a comparable adverse impact on availability or cost of coverage, or when it otherwise appears to be in the best interests of the insureds. A composite average rate is the enrollment-weighted average rate increase of all plans offered by a carrier. The independent analyst shall be made available to the public during the analysis and for the purpose of providing assistance with and testimony in connection with Medicare supplement insurance policy rate increase proposals. The cost for the analysis shall be assessed to the affected policy or certificate holders.

        6911 demonstrate that the Legislature did not intend permanently to identify and stigmatize a person who engages in abusive conduct, however minor or isolated, against an individual whose impairment is neither apparent nor known to the perpetrator.

         2. Abuse.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Plain meaning of the statute that defines "abuse" as intentionally subjecting a vulnerable adult to behavior that should reasonably be expected to result in intimidation, fear, humiliation, degradation, agitation, disorientation, or other forms of serious emotional distress indicates that it has both subjective and objective elements. The mental element of the statute is subjective - the individual in question must have acted intentionally; the result of the individual's behavior is measured by an objective standard - whether it is reasonably to be expected that the individual's behavior will result in serious emotional distress in the vulnerable adult. In re E.C., 188 Vt. 546, 1 A.3d 1007 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute that defines "abuse" as intentionally subjecting a vulnerable adult to behavior that should reasonably be expected to result in intimidation, fear, humiliation, degradation, agitation, disorientation, or other forms of serious emotional distress contains the terms "intimidation," "agitation," and "disorientation," among others, and importantly concludes with the phrase "or other forms of serious emotional distress." This catchall indicates that the Legislature intended that the results in the statutory list apply only if they rise to the level of "serious emotional distress." In re E.C., 188 Vt. 546, 1 A.3d 1007 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not improper for the Human Services Board to consider a vulnerable adult's actual reaction as an important factor in reaching the decision not to substantiate a report of abuse against a petitioner. The application of an objective reasonableness test does not preclude the Board from considering the actual consequences of a petitioner's conduct to assist it in determining how a reasonable person would view such conduct. In re E.C., 188 Vt. 546, 1 A.3d 1007 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Human Services Board properly found that petitioner did not abuse a disabled student by "dunking" him underwater when the student refused to do physical therapy exercises in a pool. The Board found that petitioner dunked the student three times, that the incident lasted less than 25 seconds, that the student was agitated prior to and during the dunking but not after the dunking, and that afterward he completed the remainder of his physical therapy program. In re E.C., 188 Vt. 546, 1 A.3d 1007 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        A report of abuse as defined by subdivision (1)(A) cannot be substantiated without evidence that the perpetrator knew, or should have known, of the alleged victim's status as an elderly or disabled adult. In re Tinker, 165 Vt. 621, 686 A.2d 946 (mem.) (1996).

         3. Vulnerable adult.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Application of the doctrine of collateral estoppel was inappropriate with respect to the substantiation of a mother's abuse of her developmentally disabled daughter because the issues in a probate court proceeding involving her termination of guardianship over the daughter were separate and distinguishable, and the legal standards and burdens employed in each action were different. In re Harwood, 195 Vt. 7, 86 A.3d 976 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence supported the trial court's conclusion that plaintiff was a vulnerable adult. She had significant impairments that had delayed her ability to understand, to express herself, and to handle her own affairs; she was under the age of majority when at least some of the alleged abusive and exploitative conduct took place; and she was the subject of a guardianship giving her parents broad powers over nearly all aspects of her life. Smith v. Wright, 194 Vt. 326, 79 A.3d 876 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no jurisdiction for an order against defendant under the Abuse of Vulnerable Adults statute because a mere listing of physical ailments, which many people suffer, was not sufficient to establish that plaintiff was unable to protect herself from abuse, neglect, or exploitation. Farr v. Searles, 180 Vt. 642, 910 A.2d 929 (mem.) (November 1, 2006).

        In an action against an attorney serving as general counsel to the Commissioner of Aging and Disabilities, claiming that she knew or should have known that a report of substantiated abuse was incomplete, and that she violated ministerial duties by failing to investigate further, while this may have been imprudent and even neglectful, it did not violate a ministerial duty under subsection (c) of this section; the decision whether to investigate further was a discretionary one, and therefore protected from suit.

        Court is required to issue orders it deems necessary to protect vulnerable adults who have been abused. The statute does not require that the abuse of the vulnerable adult occurred after the adult reached the age of majority. Smith v. Wright, 194 Vt. 326, 79 A.3d 876 (2013).

       </h5>
       <p>
        There was sufficient evidence to support a relief-from-abuse order in a vulnerable-adult case. Plaintiff testified that on more than five occasions defendant had sexual contact with her, and although defendant denied this, other evidence supported plaintiff's testimony; defendant admitted to being alone with plaintiff at times that coincided with her recollection of sexual contact, and he reacted very passionately in situations concerning plaintiff.
