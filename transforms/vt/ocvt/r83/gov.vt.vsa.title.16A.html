    The first charter of the University of Vermont was granted on November 3, 1791. Subsequent legislation included: <cite class="vt-code">1802, No. 95</cite>, related to the University's lands and certain University exemptions from property taxation; <cite class="vt-code">1810, No. 83</cite>, related to the Board of Trustees and the corporate powers of the University; <cite class="vt-code">1823, No. 34</cite>, related to the Board of Trustees and meetings of the corporation; <cite class="vt-code">1825, No. 74</cite>, and <cite class="vt-code">1826, No. 67</cite>, related to the incorporation of the Medical Society of the University of Vermont; 1828, No.16, related to the Board of Trustees and to student examinations; <cite class="vt-code">1834, No. 41</cite>, related to the incorporation of the University Institute of the University of Vermont; and <cite class="vt-code">1845, No. 10</cite> related to student examinations.
     </p>
     <p>
      The Vermont Agricultural College was created on November 22, 1864, by No. 96 of 1864. The University of Vermont and State Agricultural College was incorporated on November 9, 1865, by <cite class="vt-code">1865, No. 83</cite>. Sections 1, 2, and 4 of the 1865 act were later amended, and sections 14, 15, and 16 were added, by <cite class="vt-code">1955, No. 66</cite>. Under section 1 of the 1865 act, as amended, the University of Vermont and the Vermont Agricultural College, with such other corporations as might thereafter become united therewith, were united and constituted a body corporate, by the name of the "University of Vermont and State Agricultural College."
     </p>
     <p>
      References in sections 5, 6, 7, and 8 of the charter to "said act of Congress" or "the act of Congress" most likely refer to the Morrill Act of 1862, 12 Stat. 503.
     </p>
     <p>
      Pursuant to <cite class="vt-code">1878, No. 50</cite>, the procedure for the vacation of the corporation's charter was set forth. The State Agriculture Experiment Station was established by <cite class="vt-code">1886, No. 73</cite>. By <cite class="vt-code">1917, No. 67</cite>, the term of a University trustee was set to commence on February 1. There was further clarification of the corporation's conveyance of leased lands under the provisions of <cite class="vt-code">1925, No. 40</cite>.
     </p>
     <p>
      V.S. 1947

    4486, derived from <cite class="vt-code">1945, No. 71</cite>,
    <span class="s1">
     §

    1, recognized the Vermont Agricultural College as being in existence as a body corporate owned by the State of Vermont and provided for its powers and property. V.S. 1947
    <span class="s1">

    <span class="s1">
     §
    </span>
    1, exempted the real and personal property of the Vermont Agricultural College from taxation. Although not specifically repealed, these sections appear to be superseded by <cite class="vt-code">1955, No. 66</cite>, cited above, which united this corporation with the University of Vermont and added section 15 to <cite class="vt-code">1865, No. 83</cite>, exempting from taxation all real and personal property then held or owned or thereafter acquired by the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College for educational purposes.
     </p>
     <p>
      Sections 4 and 5 of <cite class="vt-code">1955, No. 66</cite>, supplemented but did not directly amend the charter. They provide as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      "Sec. 4. Nothing in this act shall modify, alter or in any manner affect the legal relationships between and the rights and obligations of the corporation known as the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College and the corporation known as the University of Vermont with respect to the University of Vermont Trust, as established and determined by decree of the Court of Chancery, Washington County, Vermont, dated September 19, 1932, pursuant to Supplemental Indenture of James B. Wilbur dated March 5, 1928, said decree and all regulations and policies adopted pursuant thereto or in connection therewith being hereby specifically recognized, confirmed and approved as to all matters relating to the existing ownership, status, terms, conditions and administration of said trust.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Sec. 5. Nothing in this act shall be construed to bring the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College within the provisions of Chapters 27, 28, 31, 188, 440, and 446 of the Vermont Statutes, Revision of 1947, as amended, provided, however, that Chapter 440 shall apply, when so provided by the legislature, with respect to any university building constructed with state funds."
     </p>
     <p>
      The titles of those chapters of the 1947 revision of the Vermont Statutes that are specifically excluded under section 5 above are:
     </p>
     <p>
      Chapter 27. Administrative Departments.
     </p>
     <p>
      Chapter 28. Classification of State Personnel.
     </p>
     <p>
      Chapter 31. Auditor of Accounts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Chapter 188. State Board of Education; Commissioner of Education, Superintendents and Supervisors.
     </p>
     <p>
      Chapter 446. Supplies.
     </p>
     <p>
      Chapter 440. Vermont Statutes, revision of 1947, which may apply when so provided by the legislature, defines the membership and duties of the State Building Council.
     </p>
     <p>
      The 1865 act, as amended by <cite class="vt-code">1955, No. 66</cite>, was further amended by <cite class="vt-code">1977, No. 49</cite>, which added students to the Board of Trustees as consumers of the services of the University and not as constituents of that institution. Section 2 of the 1955 act was amended to include two student members on the Board of Trustees, and section 2a was added, which prohibits amendment of the procedure for selection of student trustees without prior consent of the General Assembly.
     </p>
     <p>
      The charter was codified as 16 App. V.S.A. part 1, chapter 1, pursuant to the provisions of 2003, Resolution R-453 (Adj. Sess.). Titles have been added for each section, and other stylistic or technical changes, such as the incorporation of gender neutrality, have been made to conform with V.S.A. drafting practices.

      2004.
     </b>
     See also Essex Junction Village Charter, 24 App. V.S.A. chapter 221.
    </p>
    <p>
     The General Assembly approved the Essex Junction School District Charter as Act No. 113 of 1872.
    Subsequent amendments, other than one-time bonding authorization, included:
    <cite class="vt-code">1892, No. 148</cite>; <cite class="vt-code">1910, No. 327</cite>; <cite class="vt-code">1925, No. 178</cite>; <cite class="vt-code">1939, No. 281</cite>; <cite class="vt-code">1955, No. 321</cite>; <cite class="vt-code">1963, No. 239</cite>; <cite class="vt-code">1965, No. 214</cite>; <cite class="vt-code">1969, No. 149</cite>; 1976, Local Referendum; 1977, Local Referendum.
    </p>
    <p>
     In 1983, the voters approved a comprehensive revision of the charter by local referendum. The 1976, 1977, and 1983 votes were not legislatively approved as General Assembly action was not statutorily required during those years.
    The General Assembly approved amendments to the 1983 revised charter in 1994, No. M-14; 1996, No. M-13; 1997, No. M-1; and 1999, No. M-13 (Adj. Sess.).
    </p>
    <p>
     As the 1983 comprehensive revision reconstituted the structure and wording of the charter, it is listed as the base source for each section.

     Final Report
    </p>
    <p>
     The School Districts of St. Albans City and St. Albans Town are necessary to the establishment of the Bellows Free Academy Union High School District.
    </p>
    <p>
     Many surrounding School Districts were contacted and considered for possible inclusion in the Union High School District. No additional school districts beyond St. Albans City and St. Albans Town are being recommended at this time as advisable to be included.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Union High School will offer education to students in grades 9 through 12.
    </p>
    <p>
     There are no new facilities necessary for the formation of this proposed Union High School District. If approved, the Union High School District will utilize the existing BFA facilities for the purpose of educating students in grades 9 through 12. During the period of transition, any renovations or maintenance needs will be addressed by the Bellows Free Academy Board of Trustees and will be up to the discretion of that same board of trustees and subject to available financial resources.
    </p>
    <p>
     During the first year of operations the proposed Union School will provide transportation to only those students with special needs who otherwise would not be able to travel to and from school. No additional transportation will be provided during this first year to students from either St. Albans City or St. Albans Town. Beyond the first year, decisions regarding transportation of students will be left to the discretion of the Union High School Board.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Union High School District will honor all master contracts that are in place at BFA on June 30, 2005. These master agreements will continue until their specified termination date. Subsequent master contracts will be subject to legal and agreed upon bargaining procedures.
    </p>
    <p>
     All administrators, teachers and staff, employed by the current private school at the time of the formation of this Union High School will continue in their employment during the first year of operating the proposed Union High School District. Executing subsequent personnel contracts will be the decision of the Union High School Board. All personnel hired by the Union High School District must meet State of Vermont education licensing requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
     The curriculum and education programs currently being offered to students at BFA are considered adequate and desirable. Therefore, the proposed Union School District will, for the first year of operations, offer the curriculum and education programs that are in place on June 30, 2005. The curriculum and programs offered in the new Union High School District will meet all State and Federal legal requirements.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Union High School District will assume a current total debt of $5,221,726.00 specific to existing properties of the Bellows Free Academy. The breakdown of debt for the combined principal and interest is as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
     ì
     ADA Project (Elevator) = Total $337,983.00
    </p>
    <p>
     ì
     Hospital Conversion = Total $2,764,965.00
    </p>
    <p>
     ì
     Collins-Perley Sports Center = $411,289.00
    </p>
    <p>
     ì
     BFA North Project, Windows & Roof = $1,707,489.00
    </p>
    <p>
     ì
     The Union High School District will assume any additional debt accumulated during the 2004 and 2005 fiscal years that is necessary to maintain the school and its facilities at its current level as of October 2003.
    </p>
    <p>
     Following approval by the Franklin Superior Court, the Trustees of Bellows Free Academy will convey to the Union High School District, subject to all encumbrances of record, all of the real estate and personal property utilized by Bellows Free Academy, including all land and buildings of Bellows Free Academy and the Collins Perley Center.
    </p>
    <p>
     The allocation of allowable capital and operating expenses of the Union High School District will be based on the proportionate average daily membership (ADM), as defined by Vermont State Statutes, for the preceding year in grades 9 through 12 for St. Albans City and St. Albans Town.
    </p>
    <p>
     Membership on the Union High School Board will be apportioned based on the combined population of both St. Albans City and St. Albans Town as determined by the most recent United States Census. However, at no time will a member school district have less than one board member on the Union High School Board. Each member school district will be entitled to one school board member for each one-fifth, or the greater portion thereof, of said combined population.
    </p>
    <p>
     Initially there will be three school board members from St. Albans City and two school board members from St. Albans Town serving on the Union High School Board.
    </p>
    <p>
     School Board Members will be elected for three-year terms except those initially elected at the time of the formation of the Union High School District. In the initial election, there will be one member from St. Albans City elected for a three-year term and one member from St. Albans Town elected for a three-year term. In the initial election, there will be one member from St. Albans City elected for a two-year term and one member from St. Albans Town elected for a two-year term. In the initial election, St. Albans City will have one member elected for a term of one year.
    </p>
    <p>
     The proposal for forming a Union High School District will be presented to the voters of each community on March 2, 2004 at which time school board members will be elected. The Union High School District will commence educational operations on July 1, 2005 in order to provide a transition time for properly engaging in necessary legal proceedings and to enable the school board to enact policies and other matters necessary for operating the new Union High School District.
    </p>
    <p>
     On July 1, 2005, following approval by the Franklin Superior Court, the elected School Board members of the Union High School District will assume the duties and responsibilities as Trustees of the Bellows Free Academy Trust, under the terms and conditions of said "approval ".
    </p>
    <p>
     If the Franklin Superior Court does not approve the assumption of duties of the Trustees of Bellows Free Academy by the elected Union High School Board members, then the Bellows Free Academy Trust will continue to be maintained by the established Board of Trustees for the benefit of the Union High School.

     That the existing school buildings (two in Corinth and three in Topsham) would not be acquired by the Union District Board.
    </p>
    <p>
     That the Town of Corinth would pay the Town of Topsham its proportionate share of the cost of the school site previously alluded to in point No. 4 according to the cost sharing formula recommended by the committee in point No. 8 below. The Average Daily Membership figure of October 1, 1969 would determine the proportionate cost per town.
    </p>
    <p>
     That each school District shall share in the capital and operating expenses of the union as nearly as possible in that proportion which the A.D.M. of the District bears to the total A.D.M. of each town in the Union. The calculation will be determined according to the A.D.M. figure of October 1 of each operating year.
    </p>
    <p>
     That the method of proportioning school Director representation which each proposed member district shall have on the Union School Board will be as follows:
    </p>
    <p>
     One school Director shall be elected from each town for a total of two. One additional school Director shall be elected from each town for every 100 pupils or fractional part thereof. This formula provides for an initial Union School Board of six members, three from each town.
    </p>
    <p>
     The term of Office of Directors initially elected shall be arranged so that one-third expire on July first following the second annual meeting, one-third on July first following the third annual meeting and one-third on July first following the fourth annual meeting, or as near to that proportion as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     That the Union proposal will be submitted to the voters in each town as soon as possible and in conformance with the Statutes.
    </p>

     CORINTH-TOPSHAM CURRICULUM COMMITTEE REPORT
    </p>
    <p>
     Corinth-Topsham curriculum would be planned around a Continuous Progress Program covering a chronological age equivalent to K-8 traditional elementary program.
    </p>
    <p>
     The primary (K-3) and intermediate (4-8) sections would be divided into skill levels.
    </p>
    <p>
     It will be necessary to develop:
    </p>
    <p>
     Clearly written materials that present a learning skills sequence that is operationally defined. These documents or "skills curricula" would carefully define the skills to be acquired; describe the method or methods for establishing the necessary learning sequence; and indicate the optimum materials, equipment, etc., to accomplish the skill acquisition.
    </p>
    <p>
     A carefully thought out set of diagnostic instruments to determine where a child is in relation to the established skills curriculum.
    </p>
    <p>
     A learning inventory or profile to assess a child's progress and position in skill acquisition.
    </p>
    <p>
     An organizational framework that encourages flexible scheduling and allows each child to work at his optimum level of efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
     The children will be grouped only on the basis of their need for particular skill development and acquisition.
    </p>
    <p>
     Each child will be able to move freely within either the primary or intermediate level.
    </p>
    <p>
     Enriched materials will be provided for those children who move rapidly through a learning skills sequence but are not yet ready to move from the primary to the intermediate level. Reinforcement material would be provided for those children who would be initially placed downward or who move more slowly through the skills sequence.
    </p>
    <p>
     The seventh and eighth grades will be departmentalized to a degree to fully utilize their expanded programs in home economics, industrial arts and physical education.
    </p>
    <p>
     The emphasis in the curricula will be on the acquisition of skill in the reading and math areas. The other major subjects to be covered extensively in the K-8 program will be used as vehicles for further reinforcement in the reading-math skills sequence. The basic orientation of this program considers the acquisition of basic skills essential for pupil progress. Physical education and health programs will be part of the curriculum especially on the intermediate level. A music-art combination room will be provided. To implement this curriculum we need a flexible building providing a library resource center, math-science facilities, physical education, art, music, guidance, health, home economics and industrial arts.
    </p>
    <p>
     The implementation of this curriculum will be accomplished through a cooperative effort on the part of the principal, staff and local community working within the guidelines of the Vermont design.
