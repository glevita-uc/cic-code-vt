        Assuming that requested information was confidential, and thus within the ambit of this section, a request for documents via subpoena is a "legal process" within the plain meaning of the statute. Watson v. Dimke, 178 Vt. 504, 872 A.2d 337 (mem.) (March 3, 2005).

        The plain language of this section does not support the contention that the existence of a procedure for challenging subpoenas imposes a heightened duty on accountants to resist non-governmental subpoenas. Watson v. Dimke, 178 Vt. 504, 872 A.2d 337 (mem.) (March 3, 2005).

        This section, which specifically mentions consultation as one of the activities proscribed for one not registered, does not mean that any kind of consultation between architects of different states can be contractually valid only with registration, but it does mean that when the nonresident architect presumes to consult, advise, and service, in some direct measure, a Vermont client relative to Vermont construction, he is putting himself within the scope of the Vermont architectural registration law and services rendered need not be repetitive to be prohibited where architect does not register.

        Architectural contracts entered into in violation of registration statutes are illegal, and the provisions for payment of commissions under them are unenforceable. Markus & Nocka v. Julian Goodrich Architects, Inc., 127 Vt. 404, 250 A.2d 739 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Architectural firm, which had no members registered as architects within State, hired to perform consultation service on construction of hospital within State, could not enforce its contract for consultation services and could not recover for such services. Markus & Nocka v. Julian Goodrich Architects, Inc., 127 Vt. 404, 250 A.2d 739 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff's presentation of himself to the public as one who does the work of an architect constituted holding himself out as an architect, was part of the activity sought to be regulated by registration, and was forbidden to those unlicensed persons not falling within the permitted exceptions, within which plaintiff did not fall; therefore plaintiff's oral contract with defendants to provide architectural services was unenforceable and defendants, not plaintiff, should have been granted a directed verdict in plaintiff's suit to recover for the services, notwithstanding that plaintiff did not label himself, his plans, or his business with the title "architect" or "registered architect." Rodgers v. Kelley, 128 Vt. 146, 259 A.2d 784 (1969).

        Failure of architect to obtain license could not be grounds for a suit for return of the architect's fee; the licensing statute itself does not authorize recovery of fees and, moreover, recovery of payments is not necessary to effectuate the policy of the licensing statutes.

    Notification of the results of such examinations shall be mailed to each candidate within 30 days of the date the results are received by the Board.
    A candidate failing to pass the examinations may apply for re-examination and may sit for any regularly scheduled examination as many times as the candidate chooses to do so.

        Section 864(b), which states that diagnosis, treatment planning, and prescription may not be delegated to a dental assistant, and this section are sufficiently clear to inform the ordinary person that a dentist must personally examine a patient complaining of pain to determine the cause of the disorder, and not delegate such a task to a dental assistant with only a subsequent consultation between the assistant and the dentist in another area of the building. The statute is not unconstitutionally vague. It is not necessary, or possible, for a statute that regulates a professional field to detail each and every act that is prohibited. Braun v.

        There was sufficient evidence for the Board of Dental Examiners to find that respondent's failure to examine his patient after surgery, despite repeated complaints of discomfort, and instead, allowing his assistant to examine the patient, determine the nature of the problem, and modify her dentures, amounted to a gross violation of the standard of care.

       <p>
        Where respondent, a dentist, was charged with violating the statutory standard of care "when he allowed his dental assistant" to perform certain duties, and the charges were filed directly against respondent, separate charges being brought against his dental assistant, this was sufficient to inform respondent that his role in complainant's care, including adequacy of care, and not merely the actions of his assistant, would be scrutinized by the Board of Dental Examiners. Braun v. Board of Dental Examiners, 167 Vt. 110, 702 A.2d 124 (1997).

        864(b) are sufficiently clear to inform the ordinary person that a dentist must personally examine a patient complaining of pain to determine the cause of the disorder, and not delegate such a task to a dental assistant with only a subsequent consultation between the assistant and the dentist in another area of the building.

        In resolving grievance of State employee ordered to sign permit certification that he believed contained untrue statements, Labor Relations Board did not err in refusing to consider employee's ethical obligations under canons of professional engineering; canons were not relevant to employee's responsibility to sign certification since employee's position did not require a professional engineering license, and it was employee's supervisors who had ultimate responsibility and authority to interpret technical standards and determine whether a permit application was in compliance.

     Editor's note.
    </b>
    The 1997 adjourned session amendment to the introductory paragraph of subsec. (b) appears to have been inadvertently omitted from the 1999 adjourned session version. The version of the introductory paragraph of subsec. (b), as it was last amended by <cite class="vt-code">1997, No. 145</cite> (Adj. Sess.),

       In addition, the 1999 adjourned session amendment did not reflect the previous renumbering of subdivisions in subsec.

        It was unnecessary to allege in an information for advertising and holding one's self out to public as a physician and surgeon, that respondent practiced medicine without license. State v. Kaatz, 92 Vt. 497, 104 A. 873 (1918).

        Indictment for practicing medicine without license, wherein only allegation of commission of an offense by respondent was that he "did hold himself out to the public as a practicing physician in this state," was bad on demurrer. State v. Wilson, 79 Vt. 379, 65 A. 88 (1906).

The reporter or affiliated entity shall complete the investigation or inquiry even if the licensee initiates a resignation, leave of absence, termination, or nonrenewal, and shall make a report to the Board if the investigation results in a finding of a reportable disciplinary action. Resignations and leaves of absence that are entirely voluntary by the licensee, and terminations and nonrenewals of employment or contract by a required reporter that are not related to acts or omissions of the licensee, are not reportable disciplinary actions.

The same or related acts or omissions includes similar behavior or behavior involving the same parties, or both. Oral censure, oral reprimand, and oral admonition are not considered reportable disciplinary actions, and notation of an oral censure, oral reprimand, or oral admonition in a personnel or supervisor's file does not transform the action from oral to written.

        There was no merit to a physician's argument that the court did not owe deference to the Medical Practice Board's decision insofar as none of the Board members were ophthalmologists specializing in cataract surgery. Nine members of the seventeen-member Board were required to be licensed physicians, and only six members were not required to be associated with the medical field; hence, the majority of the Board members had specialized knowledge pertaining to medical matters, and the Board's decisions were owed substantial deference.

        Under provision of this section that defines the conviction of a crime as unprofessional conduct, the issue of guilt of the crime may not be relitigated at a later disciplinary hearing based on conviction of the crime.

       <p>
        In State board's proceedings against physician for unprofessional conduct, in which license to practice was revoked on ground of conviction in another state of several federal drug law violations, evidence that the conviction resulted from entrapment, that principal witness in the criminal proceeding was later convicted of perjury, and that there was a conflict of interest involving that witness and defense counsel, was not admissible as a collateral attack on the conviction or on subsequent revocation of license to practice in New Hampshire.

       <p>
        Statute governing unprofessional conduct provides no basis for disciplining a supervising physician whose physician assistant has committed an unprofessional act where the supervising physician has met or exceeded all standards of care. In re Porter, 192 Vt. 601, 70 A.3d 915 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court has held that the statute addressing unprofessional conduct by a physician and the statute concerning dishonorable conduct are not coextensive; it did not hold that the latter statute was applicable only to conduct engaged in outside the medical practice. Rather, it held that the statute empowered the Medical Practice Board to determine the personal and professional qualifications of individuals who may obtain and hold a license. In re Appeal of Chase, 186 Vt. 355, 987 A.2d 924 (2009).

        Although an administrative body's interpretation of the statutory provisions it must execute will be sustained on appeal absent a compelling indication of error, to the extent that rule conflicts with statute, rule cannot be sustained; thus Board of Medical Practice's rule limiting the Board's jurisdiction to conduct that is sanctionable to that listed in 26 V.S.A.

        There was no abuse of discretion in the Medical Practice Board's ruling that irrespective of the general thoroughness and attentiveness of respondent's nurses in follow-up interviews with patients, respondent himself had the responsibility to engage each patient personally in an assessment of visual function and its effect on that patient's visual needs and quality of life. If in fact respondent failed to satisfy a reasonable standard of care in assessing a patient's need for cataract surgery, such a deficiency could not be overcome by even a thorough informed consent procedure conducted by nurses. In re Appeal of Chase, 186 Vt. 355, 987 A.2d 924 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Medical Practice Board properly found that respondent engaged in unprofessional conduct by describing cataracts as "dense" when it found that generally, a cataract described as dense was one that was more clinically significant and presented characteristics that might be associated with a higher risk for surgical complications. The Board further found that respondent's use of the word "dense" to describe patients' trace or early cataracts did not conform to the understanding of what that term meant as established by the expert testimony and the practice standard accepted by the parties; furthermore, there was expert testimony that it was important for eye doctors to document what grade a cataract was for future comparison because other doctors might later want to view previous medical records to determine what was seen at an earlier time. In re Appeal of Chase, 186 Vt. 355, 987 A.2d 924 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Medical Practice Board did not err in finding that respondent engaged in unprofessional conduct with respect to statements he made to patients about obtaining a second opinion. The Board's finding that respondent's testimony was not credible was supported by testimony of several patients. In re Appeal of Chase, 186 Vt. 355, 987 A.2d 924 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no error in finding that respondent engaged in unprofessional conduct by failing to participate in a collaborative process with his patients to assess their need for cataract surgery. The parties stipulated to the standard of care set forth in the American Academy of Ophthalmology's Preferred Practice Pattern for indications and contra-indications for performing cataract surgery, and the evidence demonstrated that respondent failed to meet the standard with respect to some of his patients. In re Appeal of Chase, 186 Vt. 355, 987 A.2d 924 (2009).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Word "willful," though given different definitions under different circumstances, cannot well mean less than intentionally and by design. Accordingly, the Medical Practice Board did not err in declining to find a willful violation of the statutory prohibition against filing false reports based upon its conclusion that the inaccurate entries in respondent's records were the result of missteps other than purposeful falsification. In re Appeal of Chase, 186 Vt. 355, 987 A.2d 924 (2009).

       </h5>
       <p>
        There was no due process violation when for each of the eight patients in question, the State's complaint cited misleading statements or inaccurate records respondent made regarding a second opinion and generally charged him with unprofessional conduct; with respect to four of those patients to whom respondent made statements that actively dissuaded them from obtaining a second opinion, the State also charged him with engaging in conduct that fell below the personal and moral standards set forth in the license revocation statute. The State's complaint was more than sufficient to place respondent on notice as to what the charges were, and, in fact, respondent vigorously defended himself and cross-examined each of the patients as to his conduct concerning their obtaining a second opinion; for its part, the Medical Practice Board made findings and conclusions on this point that essentially tracked the State's charges.

         6. Particular cases.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Any finding of unprofessional conduct would necessarily have been based upon the conduct of a physician assistant (PA) alone because the Board of Medical Practice found that the physician himself did not fail to meet the standards of care, and in one case exceeded that required by the Board. Because the statute governing unprofessional conduct did not include a basis for disciplining a physician based solely upon the acts of a PA, the Board quite simply would not have had the authority to sanction the physician for the PA's acts under that statute. In re Porter, 192 Vt. 601, 70 A.3d 915 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a license suspension proceeding, the record did not support a physician's claim that the Medical Practice Board's findings of unprofessional conduct were based on surmise or were insufficiently tethered to the evidence. The Board found that the evidence suggested that the physician's initial examination and his continuing oversight of his patients was superficial at best and not up to the strict professional standards required by the Policy for the Use of Controlled Substances for the Treatment of Pain for physicians prescribing narcotics; the Board also cited specific evidence in finding that the physician had failed to adequately discuss the risks of controlled substances with his patients or evaluate behaviors indicating the possibility of drug dependence or diversion, that he had prescribed narcotics in greater amounts than the actual dosages required, and that his testimony at the post-suspension evidentiary hearing failed to provide the missing rationale or adequate explanation of his treatment and prescribing practices. In re Miller, 186 Vt. 505, 989 A.2d 982 (2009).

        Court defers to determinations that require the Medical Practice Board to apply its expertise or weigh whether certain behavior violated the standard of care pertaining to professional conduct, and it would not, therefore, second-guess the Board's conclusion that a physician's actions in prescribing narcotics in excessive quantity without an adequate rationale or concern for the risks of drug dependence and diversion violated the standards of professional conduct. Nor was expert testimony required for a board composed in substantial part of a licensee's peers. In re Miller, 186 Vt. 505, 989 A.2d 982 (2009).

        Court has held that the statute addressing unprofessional conduct by a physician and the statute concerning dishonorable conduct are not coextensive; it did not hold that the latter statute was applicable only to conduct engaged in outside the medical practice. Rather, it held that the statute empowered the Medical Practice Board to determine the personal and professional qualifications of individuals who may obtain and hold a license.

       <p>
        There was no due process violation when for each of the eight patients in question, the State's complaint cited misleading statements or inaccurate records respondent made regarding a second opinion and generally charged him with unprofessional conduct; with respect to four of those patients to whom respondent made statements that actively dissuaded them from obtaining a second opinion, the State also charged him with engaging in conduct that fell below the personal and moral standards set forth in the license revocation statute. The State's complaint was more than sufficient to place respondent on notice as to what the charges were, and, in fact, respondent vigorously defended himself and cross-examined each of the patients as to his conduct concerning their obtaining a second opinion; for its part, the Medical Practice Board made findings and conclusions on this point that essentially tracked the State's charges.

        Although an administrative body's interpretation of the statutory provisions it must execute will be sustained on appeal absent a compelling indication of error, to the extent that rule conflicts with statute, rule cannot be sustained; thus Board of Medical Practice's rule limiting the Board's jurisdiction to conduct that is sanctionable to that listed in 26 V.S.A.

       <p>
        Board of Medical Practice's statutory authority to issue or deny a medical license necessarily implied discretionary authority to deny leave to withdraw a license application; State's interest in regulating entrance to medical profession was compelling, and Board's authority to continue a disciplinary investigation to completion and deny an application where necessary was an integral and necessary component of Board's reciprocal duties vis-a-vis other licensing jurisdictions.

        Although the Medical Practice Board ultimately concluded that the evidence was insufficient to find that respondent willfully falsified records and intentionally performed what he knew to be unnecessary cataract surgery, the Board also concluded that he actively and aggressively discouraged some of his patients from getting a second opinion; it found that his statements were misleading, confusing, and improper, and that they were made at a time when the patients were particularly vulnerable and concerned about their eyes. The Board acted within its discretion in determining that his behavior and statements, combined with the inaccurate statements placed in those patients' records as to whether they had received a second opinion or wanted surgery, amounted to dishonorable conduct subjecting him to revocation of his medical license.

     </h3>
     <p>
      In order to strengthen access to health care, and in recognition of the advances in the delivery of health care, the member states of the Interstate Medical Licensure Compact have allied in common purpose to develop a comprehensive process that complements the existing licensing and regulatory authority of state medical boards and provides a streamlined process that allows physicians to become licensed in multiple states, thereby enhancing the portability of a medical license and ensuring the safety of patients. The Compact creates another pathway for licensure and does not otherwise change a state's existing Medical Practice Act. The Compact also adopts the prevailing standard for licensure and affirms that the practice of medicine occurs where the patient is located at the time of the physician-patient encounter, and therefore, requires the physician to be under the jurisdiction of the state medical board where the patient is located. State medical boards that participate in the Compact retain the jurisdiction to impose an adverse action against a license to practice medicine in that state issued to a physician through the procedures in the Compact.

        Statute governing a physician's liability for the activities of his physician assistant does not make supervising physicians answerable as a matter of professional discipline solely for the unprofessional acts of the physician assistants they supervise because the statute does not pertain to professional responsibility. Thus, the Board of Medical Practice properly concluded that it was not required to find a physician guilty of unprofessional conduct based solely on the acts of his physician assistant.

        Both the common definitions and the statutory structure and intent support a conclusion that the Legislature's use of the words "repairs" and "alterations" in the provision exempting from the need for a plumbing license work done by "a person who performs miscellaneous jobs of manual labor on the person's own property in the course of which plumbing repairs or alterations are made" was meant to exempt work by an owner who fixes broken plumbing or makes slight changes to the structure of the plumbing. Khamnei v. Burlington Pub. Works Comm'n, 206 Vt. 550, 183 A.3d 1157 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Exemption from a plumbing licence requirement for "a person who regularly employs a maintenance person whose duties include the maintenance of plumbing on the property of that person" as written is unambiguous; it exempts maintenance, not installation. As appellant conceded that the work he proposed was not maintenance, this exception did not relieve him of the obligation to have a licensed individual perform the work. Khamnei v. Burlington Pub. Works Comm'n, 206 Vt. 550, 183 A.3d 1157 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Connecting the water supply to a Jacuzzi, which required installation of shut-off and anti-scald valves and a new water heater, and replacing a sewer pipe, which entailed disconnecting branch lines and installing updated fittings, did not fall within the exemption from the need for a plumbing license for "repairs or alterations," which was meant to exempt work by an owner who fixed broken plumbing or made slight changes to the structure of the plumbing. Khamnei v. Burlington Pub. Works Comm'n, 206 Vt. 550, 183 A.3d 1157 (2018).

        Irrespective of the coverage of the personal property, a transaction where a real estate broker marketed the sellers' real property, business, and personal property fell within the scope of the laws governing real estate brokers and salespersons because it involved the sale of real estate.

        This section requiring licensing of real estate brokers and salesmen and providing on the one hand that it does not apply to those selling their own property, and on the other hand that those selling on behalf of or in the interest of any corporation having as one of its purposes the sale of real estate must be licensed, is ambiguous in that latter provision forbids a corporation from selling its own property without licensing its own agents, and would not be read to lead to such an irrational and unintended result; the latter provision means "any corporate real estate broker."

         3. Vicarious liability.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Since this section provides that a real estate salesperson can only be licensed when he or she is employed by some licensed real estate broker, and section 2292 of this title, governing license applications, provides that a salesperson's license terminates when that employment relationship ceases, it is axiomatic that the Legislature intended to impose a relationship of vicarious liability upon the employers of those salespersons for any violations of the prescribed conduct set forth in this chapter, or in the regulations of the Real Estate Commission. In re Desautels Real Estate, Inc., 142 Vt. 326, 457 A.2d 1361 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section defining real estate broker and real estate salesperson, the named licensee of a corporation holding a real estate license, as principal broker for the corporation, is the alter ego of that corporation and, as such, is held vicariously liable for any violations of this chapter, or of the rules of the Real Estate Commission, by any of the other brokers or salespersons working for the same corporation. In re Desautels Real Estate, Inc., 142 Vt. 326, 457 A.2d 1361 (1982).

        Plaintiff realtors association, which challenged constitutionality of this section, failed to show significant impairment of its associational rights or any demonstrable injury that would result from its members having to disclose whether they belonged to a real estate association, and therefore neither a strict scrutiny standard of review nor further factual investigation was required. Vermont Association of Realtors, Inc. v. State, 156 Vt. 525, 593 A.2d 462 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Requirement of this section that at least one of three broker members of seven-member real estate commission not be a member of a professional real estate association was rationally related to State's legitimate interest in creating a real estate commission with broad representation, and summary judgment against realtors association that challenged constitutionality of this section was appropriate.

        The Real Estate Commission correctly denied motion by brokers and salespersons charged with misconduct for disqualification of members of Commission since this section mandates that all members be licensed real estate brokers, the mere fact that all members of the Commission participated in the investigation of the individuals charged did not disqualify them from adjudicating the outcome of that investigation.

        Real Estate Commission could not have fairly and reasonably concluded that applicant for examination for broker's license was incompetent to transact the business of a broker where it had found he had worked in the real estate business for 30 years in contracting, construction, development, sales, design, and finance and had taken real estate courses at the university level; rather, the evidence tended to show competence.

         2. Vicarious liability.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Since section 2211 of this title provides that a real estate salesperson can only be licensed when he or she is employed by some licensed real estate broker, and subsection (b) of this section provides that a salesperson's license terminates when that employment relationship ceases, it is axiomatic that the Legislature intended to impose a relationship of vicarious liability upon the employers of those salespersons for any violations of the prescribed conduct set forth in this chapter or in the regulations of the real estate commission.

        A map did not meet the statutory definition for land surveying since it was not prepared "for conveyancing," but was instead created for the sole purpose of obtaining a subdivision permit. State v. Brooks, 177 Vt. 161, 861 A.2d 1096 (September 3, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the definition of land surveying did not prohibit the "preparation of subdivision proposals," the preparation of a subdivision proposal would become an issue only if it allegedly involved land surveying within the statutory definition; thus; the exclusion in subsection 2503 (b) of this title was a legislative recognition that preparing a map for subdivision approval should not be considered land surveying. State v. Brooks, 177 Vt. 161, 861 A.2d 1096 (September 3, 2004).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The reference in this section to maps as a class of documents separate from surveys supported a surveyor's position that licensed land surveyors routinely create documents that are not land surveys. State v. Brooks, 177 Vt. 161, 861 A.2d 1096 (September 3, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Requirement that surveys must contain a description of information used as a basis for the work supported land surveyor's actions in preparing a map for the purpose of obtaining a subdivision permit, because the public should be expected to look to the kind of certification information he added to understand the map's nature; the presence of the surveyor's seal and signature, along with his explanatory notes, showed compliance with the applicable law, not the opposite. State v. Brooks, 177 Vt. 161, 861 A.2d 1096 (September 3, 2004).

        Where applicant sought to be licensed to use the psychological stress evaluator under this chapter and was rejected, denial of license did not result in violation of equal protection since the practice of polygraph examining has serious implications for the privacy rights of those who may be subjected to it, since within the scientific community there continues to be some discord as to the validity of the psychological stress evaluator and since an individual may be subject to a psychological stress evaluator test without being aware his truthfulness is being tested, whereas with the use of the polygraph the subject cannot be examined unknowingly, and, therefore, a rational basis for the limitation of the chapter to polygraph examiners exists. Heisse v. Vermont, 519 F. Supp. 36 (D. Vt. 1980).

       <p>
        This section was not invalid as constitutionally overboard in the case of an applicant who sought to be licensed to use the psychological stress evaluator to practice truth or deception detection under the chapter where the psychological stress evaluator clearly came within the definition of a mechanical device and section 2901 of this title, when read in conjunction with the body of the chapter, afforded fair warning of violation of chapter when a mechanical device did not meet minimum instrumentation requirements.

        Provisions of this section that a license may be revoked if the examiner fails to inform the subject of the nature of the exam and that his participation is voluntary, is evidence of a concern of the Legislature that the licensing provisions be limited to polygraph operators since an individual may be subjected to a psychological stress evaluator examination without his knowledge or consent, but with the use of the polygraph machine the subject cannot be examined unknowingly.

       It is the policy of the State of Vermont that regulation be imposed upon a profession or occupation solely for the purpose of protecting the public. The General Assembly believes that all individuals should be permitted to enter into a profession or occupation unless there is a demonstrated need for the State to protect the interests of the public by restricting entry into the profession or occupation.

        By its plain and unambiguous terms; the "least restrictive" form of regulation of the statute setting forth the policy and purpose of professional regulation applies only to those regulations governing entry into a profession or occupation; nothing in the language of the statute extends its reach to a discretionary decision by the Board of Medical Practice on whether to modify an earlier consent order sanctioning a licensed physician, such as the consent order here in which appellant agreed to a final and irrevocable surrender of her medical license. In re Taylor, 202 Vt. 511, 150 A.3d 625 (2016).

        It was error to hold that a licensed clinical social worker had engaged in unprofessional conduct when she made recommendations to a guardian ad litem (GAL) in a visitation dispute. The social worker had discussed the recommendations with the child's father, who had expressly consented to release of information about the child to the GAL, and there was no reasonable likelihood that the father was unaware of the uses to which the information could be put; while the social worker might conceivably have responded differently to the GAL's requests or pursued an alternative approach, the record did not demonstrate that the course she chose violated professional standards.

       "Clinical mental health counseling" means providing, for a consideration, professional counseling services that are primarily drawn from the theory and practice of psychotherapy and the discipline of clinical mental health counseling, involving the application of principles of psychotherapy, human development, learning theory, group dynamics, and the etiology of mental illness and dysfunctional behavior to individuals, couples, families, and groups, for the purposes of treating psychopathology and promoting optimal mental health. The practice of clinical mental health counseling includes diagnosis and treatment of mental conditions or psychiatric disabilities and emotional disorders, psychoeducational techniques aimed at the prevention of such conditions or disabilities, consultations to individuals, couples, families, groups, organizations, and communities, and clinical research into more effective psychotherapeutic treatment modalities.
      </li>
      <li id="t26c65s3261ol13">
       "Clinical mental health counselor" means a person who is licensed to practice clinical mental health counseling under this chapter.
      </li>
      <li id="t26c65s3261ol14">
       "Disciplinary action" includes any action taken by the Board against a licensed clinical mental health counselor or applicant premised on a finding that the licensed clinical mental health counselor or applicant has engaged in unprofessional conduct. The term includes all sanctions of any kind, including obtaining injunctions, refusing to grant or renew a license, suspending or revoking a license, and issuing warnings.
      </li>
      <li id="t26c65s3261ol15">

       "Psychotherapy" means the provision of treatment, diagnosis, evaluation, or counseling services to individuals or groups, for a consideration, for the purpose of alleviating mental disorders. "Psychotherapy" involves the application of therapeutic techniques to understand unconscious or conscious motivation, resolve emotional, relationship, or attitudinal conflicts, or modify behavior that interferes with effective emotional, social, or mental functioning. "Psychotherapy" follows a systematic procedure of psychotherapeutic intervention that takes place on a regular basis over a period of time, or, in the case of evaluation and brief psychotherapies, in a single or limited number of interventions. If a person is employed by or under contract with the Agency of Human Services, this definition does not apply to persons with less than a master's degree; to persons providing life skills training or instruction, such as learning to make friends, to handle social situations, to do laundry, and to develop community awareness; or to interactions of employees or contracted individuals with clients whose job description or contract specifications do not specifically mention "psychotherapy" as a job responsibility or duty.

       Except for a license issued to an appraisal management company, a licensed issued under this chapter shall be renewed biennially upon payment of the required fee and upon satisfactory completion of the minimum continuing education requirements established by AQB during the immediately preceding two-year period.

       If an individual or an appraisal management company fails to renew in a timely manner, he, she, or it may renew the license within 30 days of the renewal date by satisfying all requirements set forth in law, including, as applicable, those requirements of AQB for reactivation and payment of an additional late renewal penalty.

       The Director may require, by rule, as a condition of reactivation, that an applicant, other than an appraisal management company, undergo review of one or more aspects of the applicant's professional work in the practice of real estate appraising, provided that the manner and performance results of the review be specified by the Director. Such a review requirement shall:
       <ol>

        Where the record not only substantially supported, but virtually compelled, the conclusion that midwife repeatedly engaged in unprofessional conduct and provided substandard care to her patients, and there was ample credible support in the record for the administrative law officer's (ALO's) further conclusion that her approach to the accusations itself raised doubts about her future ability to comply with the midwifery rules, the reach of which she has consistently sought to escape through hypertechnical constructions at odds with the rules' protective purposes, the revocation of midwife's license was an appropriate exercise of the ALO's discretion.

     <p>
      The General Assembly finds that the public's health would be better protected if services by electrologists were regulated, because the unregulated practice of electrology can harm or endanger the health, safety, or welfare of the public through use of improper sterilization and infection control procedures. Electrology is the procedure performed to remove hair permanently from the human body. This is accomplished by inserting a fine, sterile needle into the hair follicle and applying a measured amount of electricity to produce heat or a chemical reaction to permanently destroy the hair follicle's germinating capacity. The practice of electrology requires adherence to strict sanitary and sterilization processes and, therefore, regulation should be by licensure of electrologists.
