        <p>
         Under provisions of this section, fact that an offense may be punished by such imprisonment makes it a felony, and fact that there is an alternative penalty of a fine does not reduce the offense to a misdemeanor. In re Mears, 124 Vt. 131, 198 A.2d 27 (1964); State v. Howard, 108 Vt. 137, 183 A. 497 (1936).

         This section afforded no test for requirements of pleading, and hence an indictment for adultery, which was felony only by virtue of general statutory classification, did not have to allege act to have been "feloniously" done, since intent was not an ingredient of the crime.

        <p>
         Accomplice liability is meant to convict defendants who intended to, and did in fact, aid in the commission of the charged offense, but who were not the primary perpetrators of the crime or did not participate in every aspect of the planned illegal act. State v. Pitts, 174 Vt. 21, 800 A.2d 481 (2002).
        </p>
        <p>
         Jury instruction that a finding of participation in the execution of the unlawful design would support conviction as a principal and that mere presence was not enough to establish participation was in accordance with this section. State v. Miller, 146 Vt. 164, 502 A.2d 832 (1985).
        </p>
        <p>
         This section permits the conviction of a person charged as a principal, who has been shown to have done no more than aid in the commission of the crime. State v. Jaramillo, 140 Vt. 206, 436 A.2d 757 (1981).
        </p>
        <p>
         In misdemeanors, all participating parties are considered to be principals. State v. Sears, 130 Vt. 379, 296 A.2d 218 (1972); State v. Bosworth, 124 Vt. 3, 197 A.2d 477 (1963).
        </p>
        <p>
         Historical division of principals between first and second degrees, the latter being an accessory before the fact who was not present, or at least was not acting, during commission of the crime, often called an aider and abettor, is not part of Vermont law. State v. Sears, 130 Vt. 379, 296 A.2d 218 (1972).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where several persons combine under a common understanding and with a common purpose to do an illegal act, each one is criminally responsible for the act of each and all who participate with him in the execution of the unlawful design. State v. Barr, 126 Vt. 112, 223 A.2d 462 (1966); State v. Orlandi, 106 Vt. 165, 170 A. 908 (1934), overruled on other grounds in State v. Bacon, 163 Vt. 279, 658 A.2d 54 (1995).

         All who knowingly and intentionally participate in commission of misdemeanor are principals, and may be convicted thereof either separately or jointly. State v. Orlandi, 106 Vt. 165, 170 A. 908 (1934), overruled on other grounds in State v. Bacon, 163 Vt. 279, 658 A.2d 54 (1995).

         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         To establish defendant's guilt of aiding in aggravated murder of two victims, the State needed to prove that defendant aided his accomplice in the commission of each murder and had the requisite intent with respect to each murder. State v. Perez, 180 Vt. 388, 912 A.2d 944.
        </p>
        <p>
         Since "aiding" in commission of a crime is a broader concept than "aiding and abetting", special pleading may be necessary in some cases. State v. Sears, 130 Vt. 379, 296 A.2d 218 (1972).
        </p>
        <p>
         The presence of a preconceived plan with a common criminal objective, plus participation in its accomplishment to some substantial measure, will support an information charging a participant as a principal. State v. Sears, 130 Vt. 379, 296 A.2d 218 (1972).
        </p>
        <p>
         Presence at scene of crime is not alone sufficient to establish participation or aiding or abetting, unless there is something to show that person so present in some way had procured or incited or encouraged the act done by the principal perpetrator, yet where such presence is by preconcert with a design to encourage, incite, or, if it should become necessary, to render assistance, then, even though no particular act is shown, there is participation. State v. Mecier, 126 Vt. 260, 227 A.2d 298 (1967); State v. Orlandi, 106 Vt. 165, 170 A. 908 (1934), overruled on other grounds in State v. Bacon, 163 Vt. 279, 658 A.2d 54 (1995).

        <p>
         Defendant need not share with the principal the intent to use the exact means of the crime, so long as she shares the intent to commit all the elements of the crime. State v. Pitts, 174 Vt. 21, 800 A.2d 481 (2002).
        </p>
        <p>
         Although 13 V.S.A.
         §
         3, which provides that a person who aids in the commission of a felony shall be punished as a principal, does not include an intent element,
    there is an implied element of intent in the statute. State v. Bacon, 163 Vt. 279, 658 A.2d 54, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 837, 116 S. Ct. 117, 133 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1995).
        </p>
        <p>
         The purpose of the accomplice-liability rule is not to permit the conviction of participants to a crime who never intended a co-felon to commit the acts in fact committed; rather, the rule is intended to allow the conviction of defendants who intended to, and did in fact, aid in the commission of the charged offense, but who were not the primary perpetrators of the crime or did not participate in every aspect of the planned illegal act. State v. Bacon, 163 Vt. 279, 658 A.2d 54, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 837, 116 S. Ct. 117, 133 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1995).
        </p>
        <p>
         Trial court did not err in refusing defendant's request to instruct jury that defendant could be convicted of aiding in the commission of a felony (bank robbery) only if he had the intent of permanently depriving the bank of its property, even though court's view of the intent element for assault and robbery was erroneous and the defendant's view was correct, where court's instruction on accessory liability was correct and specifically stated that defendant could be convicted only if he acted with same intent as that required for his accomplice.

        <p>
         Misprision of felony was offense at common law, and was a criminal neglect either to prevent a felony from being committed or to bring offender to justice after its commission, but without such previous concert with or subsequent assistance of him as will make the concealer an accessory, either before or after the fact. State v. Wilson, 80 Vt. 249, 67 A. 533 (1907).
        </p>
        <p>
         The common law as to the misprision of felony is a part of law of this state. State v. Wilson, 80 Vt. 249, 67 A. 533 (1907).
        </p>
        <p>
         Information for misprision of felony was insufficient, unless it alleged that respondent intended to obstruct and hinder due course of justice and to cause felon to escape punishment. State v. Wilson, 80 Vt. 249, 67 A. 533 (1907).

         Where information joined counts for manslaughter, attempt to assault with a deadly weapon, being an accessory to such attempt and two counts for conspiracy to rob two different stores, the court would, in the interests of orderly criminal procedure and protection of accused against prejudice which would result from the introduction of evidence on each offense, grant accused the right to have the state elect only one count upon which to proceed with trial.

        <p>
         In a prosecution of defendant for aiding in aggravated murder, jury instructions accurately and clearly described the State's burden of proof where they explained the elements of the crime, and stated that to prove defendant's guilt as an accomplice, the State needed to show that defendant and his accomplice acted under a common plan. The court provided an in-depth explanation of what was required to establish a "common plan," including the requirement that defendant share his accomplice's intent to commit all of the legal elements of the offense. State v. Perez, 180 Vt. 388, 912 A.2d 944.
        </p>
        <p>
         Instruction accurately reflected jurisprudence on accomplice liability where it required that, in order to convict defendant, the jury had to find that defendant and the principal came to a common plan, that defendant materially participated in that, and that she just didn't happen to be there when it happened or that the principal did it without defendant's knowledge, understanding, or agreement.

         Accessory to felony charge is not a separate and distinct "other felony" for purposes of the three-year statute of limitations, as it is not wholly divorced from the principal crime to which the person is allegedly an accessory. In re Hyde, 200 Vt. 103, 129 A.3d 651 (2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         State's prosecution of defendant as an accessory to commit sexual assault on a child under the age of 16 was within the statute of limitations. Assuming arguendo that the limitations period could be triggered by the commission of the acts, as opposed to the later reporting of those acts, the limitations period began with the last alleged instance of defendant's aiding and abetting a friend to sexually molest defendant's daughter; either under the original charge against defendant or the amended charge to which she pled, the State's prosecution was within the statute of limitations. In re Hyde, 200 Vt. 103, 129 A.3d 651 (2015).

        </h5>
        <p>
         The manifest intent of the exemption in this section is to avoid criminalizing assistance to family members in evading prosecution, and the task of the supreme court is to give effect to the intent behind the exemption which the legislature has delineated. State v. Williams, 142 Vt. 81, 451 A.2d 1142 (1982).

         By its terms this section does not criminalize acts assisting siblings (or other related persons) escape prosecution, and does not remove the exemption if the sibling committed the underlying felony with others. State v. Williams, 142 Vt. 81, 451 A.2d 1142 (1982).
        </p>

         In the case of defendant convicted of being an accessory after the fact to a homicide, where the underlying homicide was committed jointly by the defendant's brother and another person, and where the defendant's brother was a juvenile at the time of the offense, this section and its sibling exemption applied to the defendant and the defendant could not be prosecuted under this section, since conviction of the underlying felony was not required by this section, but rather commission of an act which constituted a felony was the predicate to liability for assisting the offender; moreover, the exemption was defined by one's relationship to an "offender" who committed a "felony"; and therefore, although the defendant's brother could not have been punished as an adult for his act at the time of the offense, there was no question that the act he committed was a felony. State v. Williams, 142 Vt. 81, 451 A.2d 1142 (1982).

         In the case of defendant convicted of being an accessory after the fact to a homicide, where the underlying homicide was committed jointly by the defendant's brother and another person, and where the defendant's purported crime consisted entirely of deeds helping both his brother and the other person, whom he never assisted independently of his brother, the defendant's actions on behalf of his brother were not criminal under this section; to construe this section otherwise would distort its plain language. State v. Williams, 142 Vt. 81, 451 A.2d 1142 (1982).

         In the case of defendant convicted of being an accessory after the fact to a homicide, where the underlying homicide was committed by the defendant's brother and another person, the construction of this section offered by the State, namely that it did not exempt the protection of a co-defendant of a related offender, would frustrate the intent of the exemption by criminally penalizing individuals who assist family members on the basis of the involvement of co-defendants. State v. Williams, 142 Vt. 81, 451 A.2d 1142 (1982).

State v. Williams, 142 Vt. 81, 451 A.2d 1142 (1982).

         The crime of solicitation, under this section, is completed when a person advises, counsels or solicits another to commit a felony regardless of whether the crime is actually completed. State v. Brown, 147 Vt. 324, 515 A.2d 1059 (1986).
        </p>

         Defendant could have been charged with solicitation under this section for ordering another person to perform sexual intercourse with the victim, even though the order was not carried out. State v. Brown, 147 Vt. 324, 515 A.2d 1059 (1986).
        </p>

         Under this section it is a crime to endeavor to incite a felony whether or not such endeavor was successful. State v. Ciocca, 125 Vt. 64, 209 A.2d 507 (1965).
        </p>
        <p>
         One who advises, counsels, or solicits another to commit a felony, without more, violates this section, even though such crime is not committed or attempted. State v. Hudon, 103 Vt. 17, 151 A. 562 (1930).

        <p>
         Fact of defendant's offering money to his niece in return for her allowing him to have sex with her eight year old daughter was sufficient to charge him with a violation of this section because he had solicited the niece to commit the felony of being an accomplice (prohibited by 13 V.S.A.
         §
         3) to defendant's aggravated sexual assault (prohibited by 13 V.S.A.

        <p>
         Information charging that respondent did willfully, maliciously, and feloniously endeavor to incite, procure, and hire a specified person to burn latter's barn, with intent to defraud certain insurance company, was sufficient to charge violation of this section.

         In regard to charge of inciting another to commit a felony, evidence of instant messaging text of defendant's requests to mother to pose her child, take pictures for his viewing, and solicitation of her consent to carry on his own lewd photo session was sufficient for a jury to reasonably conclude that defendant had incited mother to use her daughter in a sexual performance, and/or to consent to her daughter's participation in a sexual performance, both felony offenses. State v. Voorheis, 176 Vt. 265, 844 A.2d 794 (2004).
        </p>
        <p>
         It is not necessary to demonstrate that arson was actually committed in order to sustain a conviction under this section for endeavoring to incite and procure and hire other persons to commit a felony. State v. Ciocca, 125 Vt. 64, 209 A.2d 507 (1965).
        </p>
        <p>
         In such prosecution, whether what respondent did amounted to an endeavor to incite witness to burn his barn, was question for the jury, and not for witness, to be determined from all evidence in case bearing on that issue. State v. Hudon, 103 Vt. 17, 151 A. 562 (1930).

        <p>
         Defendant's act of stabbing the victim twice in the throat constituted attempt to murder, as the victim's neck injury was sufficiently serious as to prove specific intent to kill, and a jury could reasonably interpret defendant's words that he would be back "to finish the job" to mean that he would be back later to kill the victim. Further, defendant's decision to leave the scene before he succeeded in killing the victim did not negate his specific intent to kill, as he was not thwarted by impossibility and had already committed the overt act. State v. Johnson, 195 Vt. 498, 90 A.3d 874 (2013).
        </p>
        <p>
         An attempt requires intent to commit a particular crime and an overt act designed to carry out that intent. Hence, the act must advance the actor's conduct beyond mere intent, and reach far enough toward accomplishing the desired result to amount to the commencement of the consummation. Further, once the actor has committed the requisite overt act, the offense is complete, and abandonment of the enterprise does not negate guilt. State v. Synnott, 178 Vt. 66, 872 A.2d 874 (February 4, 2005).
        </p>
        <p>
         Intent to commit grand larceny is not conditioned on showing that defendant was specifically aware of value of object stolen. State v. Houle, 157 Vt. 640, 596 A.2d 1292 (mem.) (1991).
        </p>
        <p>
         The offense of an attempt to escape from lawful confinement is committed when an act is done with intent to gain release from custody and the performance of that act is part of a series of events which would lead to the intended result if not interrupted. State v. Morse, 130 Vt. 92, 286 A.2d 286 (1971).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where, while garbage truck was at last pickup station before leaving prison, prisoner was emptied out of large refuse barrel along with its contents onto truck's tail gate and discovered immediately by a guard, guard's testimony to such events and identification of prisoner was proper basis for denial of motion for directed verdict. State v. Morse, 130 Vt. 92, 286 A.2d 286 (1971).
        </p>
        <p>
         To constitute an attempt to commit a crime, act must be of such a character as to advance conduct of actor beyond sphere of mere intent; it must reach far enough towards accomplishment of desired result to amount to commencement of the consummation. State v. Hurley, 79 Vt. 28, 64 A. 78 (1906).
        </p>
        <p>
         Mere facts that a prisoner lawfully in jail arranged for procuring saws adapted to jail breaking, and thereby got them into his possession, with intent therewith to break open the jail for purpose of escaping, did not constitute an attempt to break jail.

         State's attorney could join counts for manslaughter, attempt to assault with a deadly weapon, being an accessory to such attempt and two counts for conspiracy to rob two different stores in one information. State v. Dopp, 127 Vt. 567, 255 A.2d 186 (1969).

        <p>
         Where information joined counts for manslaughter, attempt to assault with a deadly weapon, being an accessory to such attempt and two counts for conspiracy to rob two different stores, the court would, in the interests of orderly criminal procedure and protection of accused against prejudice which would result from the introduction of evidence on each offense, grant accused the right to have the state elect only one count upon which to proceed with trial.

         Under Vermont practice, substance and effect of state's motion, prior to trial, to consolidate, for purposes of trial, a charge of passing a forged check and a charge of attempting to pass another check, also forged, was that the two cases be simply tried together, each retaining its identity, not that they be consolidated.

         Where evidence of the attack on the victim showed that defendant's actions had advanced from "mere intent" to the "commencement of the consummation" of a sexual assault, it was sufficient to show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant was guilty of attempted sexual assault; therefore, the trial court correctly denied his motion for judgment of acquittal on that charge. State v. Goodhue, 175 Vt. 457, 833 A.2d 861 (2003).
        </p>
        <p>
         Defendant was properly convicted for two crimes, larceny from the person and attempted assault and robbery, where he committed larceny from the person of one victim by ripping a necklace with a coin off of her neck, and attempted assault and robbery by threatening to shoot that victim and her husband to gain access to their safe and its contents.

         Where the crime was charged as attempted kidnapping because the victim escaped, but the initial restraint was accomplished with violence, and was reinitiated with violence and a weapon each time the victim managed to get away from defendant, sentencing in the same manner as the completed crime, as the legislature has decreed, is not constitutionally disproportionate.

        <p>
         Overt act of attempted voyeurism requires an action that would be likely to end in acquiring a view of the complainant's intimate areas. Here, because defendant was unable to see the complainant's intimate areas from his position on the ground, his actions of standing and looking would not be likely to end in the consummation of the crime intended; the act of merely looking at complainant's window from a place where no view of her intimate areas was possible was insufficient for the jury to find defendant guilty of attempted voyeurism. State v. Devoid, 188 Vt. 445, 8 A.3d 1076 (2010).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where defendant was unable to see the complainant's intimate areas from his position on the ground, the State had not provided sufficient evidence of his intent to view the complainant's intimate areas as required for a criminal attempt. Defendant apparently obtained sexual gratification from watching the upper body of a woman he believed was naked, and the Court could infer from that fact that he would like to see her naked; the Court could not infer from the facts in the record, however, that he had the intent to commit voyeurism or would have committed that crime. State v. Devoid, 188 Vt. 445, 8 A.3d 1076 (2010).
        </p>
        <p>
         When defendant, who should have been acquitted of attempted voyeurism, was unable to see the complainant's intimate areas from his position on the ground, there was no mistake; defendant necessarily knew that he could not complete the crime, and thus his conduct was equivocal. As a result, this was not an impossibility case. State v. Devoid, 188 Vt. 445, 8 A.3d 1076 (2010).

         There was no merit to defendant's suggestion that the same prior felonies could not support a habitual-offender enhancement on more than one subsequent charge. The trial court's application of the habitual-offender enhancement did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause, and was thus not error of any kind, much less plain error. State v. Stanley, 200 Vt. 341, 131 A.3d 1114 (2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         Applying three factors in considering whether defendant's sentence, as a habitual criminal, amounted to cruel and unusual punishment proscribed by the Eighth Amendment despite being permissible under the habitual-criminal statute, revealed no constitutional infirmity. The factors applied are: (1) the gravity of the offense and the harshness of the penalty; (2) sentences imposed for other offenses in the same jurisdiction; and (3) sentences imposed for the same offense in other jurisdictions. State v. Rideout, 182 Vt. 113, 933 A.2d 706 (July 20, 2007).

         Where the court imposed a sentence that was within statutory limits and was grounded explicitly on legitimate goals of criminal justice, namely restraint and deterrence, there was no abuse of the court's discretion in sentencing defendant to a term of twenty to thirty years in prison for being a habitual offender.

         There was no error in sentencing defendant, who was convicted of violating an abuse-prevention order and of five misdemeanors, to five to fourteen years under the Habitual Offender Act. Defendant's sentence was neither contrary to his plea agreement, nor inconsistent with the minimum authorized by statutes other than the Act, nor beyond the enhanced maximum allowed by the Act.

        <p>
         Habitual Offender Act says only that habitual offenders may be imprisoned "up to and including life"; there is no expressed limit on the court's authority to sentence to any term less than "up to" life. The statute is silent as to any consideration of the maximum penalty otherwise provided for nonhabitual offenders. State v. Carpenter, 193 Vt. 484, 70 A.3d 1023 (2013).

         Crimes of robbery and aggravated robbery under Pennsylvania law both include all the elements of the Vermont crime of larceny from the person, a felony, and are thus, under this section, crimes which would be felonies in Vermont and which are therefore available to establish one as an habitual offender.

        </p>
        <p>
         Where Pennsylvania law under which defendant was convicted made it a crime to attempt to cause or intentionally or knowingly cause bodily harm to a police officer making or attempting an arrest which is lawful, and Vermont law made it a felony if, with intent to prevent a law enforcement officer from performing a lawful duty, one causes physical injury to any person, Pennsylvania conviction was for a crime which would a felony under Vermont law and thus was available to establish defendant as guilty under this section.

         Pennsylvania crime of kidnapping would be felony in Vermont under Vermont kidnapping law and is thus available to establish one as an habitual offender under this section's provision requiring three prior convictions of Vermont felonies or attempts to commit felonies or of crimes of other states which would be felonious if committed in Vermont.

        <p>
         There was no uncertainty about the unanimity of the jury's verdict on all four of defendant's prior convictions where the trial court asked the jury if it reached a determination on whether each conviction the State presented - attempt to defraud, false pretenses, burglary, and retail theft - was a felony and that defendant was the person who committed the offenses, and the jury responded affirmatively to each of the four convictions separately, responding that defendant "was the one who did it."

          15. Felony convictions of minors.
         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         The language of Vermont statutes defining a felony and providing that criminal proceedings against defendants between the ages of sixteen and eighteen may be transferred to juvenile court from the criminal courts at the discretion of the criminal courts makes plain that the Legislature intended that felony convictions of minor defendants could, in the trial court's discretion, be counted toward habitual-criminal status under Vermont's habitual-criminal statute. State v. Rideout, 182 Vt. 113, 933 A.2d 706 (July 20, 2007).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where defendant, then sixteen, pleaded guilty in adult court to offenses and did not either move for transfer to juvenile court or appeal from the venue of his convictions, which he could have done, it could not be said that the district court abused its discretion in imposing an enhanced sentence on defendant based on these prior convictions. State v. Rideout, 182 Vt. 113, 933 A.2d 706 (July 20, 2007).
        </p>
        <p>
         Defendant failed in his argument, based on statutes governing the sealing of records of court proceedings in which a minor is tried and convicted as an adult, that "convictions that can be expunged, upon application, from a defendant's record because they were obtained when he was a juvenile, should not be the basis for enhancing his exposure, now as an adult, to a potential life sentence." State v. Rideout, 182 Vt. 113, 933 A.2d 706 (July 20, 2007).

         Any error in the jury instructions as to habitual offenders, to which defendant had not objected at trial, was harmless. At no time had defendant contended that any of the predicate convictions were invalid or unproven, and defense counsel conceded during oral argument that all six predicate convictions were valid.

         While it was true that defendant was not charged under the habitual offender statute - a statute that acted as a sentencing enhancement, not as a separate criminal violation - and that the felonies with which defendant was charged were not in themselves punishable by life imprisonment, this did not change the fact that defendant was charged with several felonies that, for him, were punishable by life imprisonment under the habitual offender statute. The plain language of the statute governing release in cases punishable by life imprisonment unambiguously applied to defendant, and the rule of lenity was therefore inapplicable. State v. Pellerin, 187 Vt. 482, 996 A.2d 204 (2010).
        </p>
        <p>
         Court finds no basis for exempting from the statute governing release in cases punishable by life imprisonment those defendants whose potential for life imprisonment arises out of the habitual offender statute. State v. Pellerin, 187 Vt. 482, 996 A.2d 204 (2010).

          1. Instructions.
         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         Nothing in the lesser-included-offense statute implies that the lesser-included-offense instruction cannot be given if the defendant objects to it; indeed, it states that either party may request the instruction and that it "shall" be granted if supported by the evidence. By extension, this means that (1) the State may request a lesser-included-offense instruction, even over the defendant's objections, and (2) this request must be granted if supported by the evidence. State v. Bean, 202 Vt. 361, 149 A.3d 487 (2016).
        </p>
        <p>
         Because of its value to the State and society, it is appropriate that Vermont law mandates the granting of the State's request for a lesser-included-offense instruction so long as the evidence supports it, even over the defendant's objections. Thus, the trial court did not err in giving a lesser-included-offense instruction requested by the State when defendant objected to it. State v. Bean, 202 Vt. 361, 149 A.3d 487 (2016).

         1. Purpose.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The purpose of this section is said to be for the protection of the pregnant female, protection against interference with her condition, real or supposed, by outside parties, and insofar as this prevents unskilled and untrained persons from acting in an area properly medical, the statute is valid and necessary. Beecham v. Leahy, 130 Vt. 164, 287 A.2d 836 (1972).

         2. Constitutionality.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        This section, under which petitioner for post-conviction relief was charged with willfully assisting the procurement of abortion of two women, was not unconstitutionally vague as to petitioner. State v. Bartlett, 128 Vt. 618, 270 A.2d 168 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the conduct of petitioner for post-conviction relief, who had plead guilty to two statutory charges of procuring an abortion, was such that he could clearly tell that it was prohibited, whether the statute is broadly phrased and could mislead someone else is immaterial. State v. Bartlett, 128 Vt. 618, 270 A.2d 168 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner for post-conviction relief who had plead guilty to two charges of willfully assisting the procurement of an abortion had no standing to attack this section as unconstitutional on the ground that the phrase "unless the same is necessary to preserve her life" was subject to interpretation by a doctor and that this delegates a power to a directly involved individual in violation of the fourteenth amendment and violates the doctor's constitutional rights. State v. Bartlett, 128 Vt. 618, 270 A.2d 168 (1970).

         3. Application.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The prohibitory provisions of this section do not apply to the pregnant female; as to her, her personal rights have been left to her, and there is no legislative declaration saying that her own concerns for her personal integrity are in any way criminal or proscribed. Beecham v. Leahy, 130 Vt. 164, 287 A.2d 836 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although this section avoids confrontation with the rights of a pregnant female, where it bars the medical aid such person seeks it is invalid and can not be resorted to by way of a criminal prosecution against the doctor. Beecham v. Leahy, 130 Vt. 164, 287 A.2d 836 (1972).

       <p>
        All that need be shown to warrant conviction is that respondent purposely did some of things prohibited intending thereby to procure miscarriage of a woman pregnant or supposed by him to be, and that such miscarriage was not necessary to save her life. State v. Montifoire, 95 Vt. 508, 116 A. 77 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute did not require an operation, or even a miscarriage. State v. Montifoire, 95 Vt. 508, 116 A. 77 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not essential to commission of offense of attempting to procure miscarriage of a woman pregnant with child that fetus should be alive at time attempt was made. State v. Howard, 32 Vt. 380 (1859), overruled on other grounds, State v. Briggs (1989) 152 Vt. 531, 568 A.2d 779.

        Information charging commission of offense in two ways in alternative or disjunctive form, as that respondent "did . . . employ or cause to be employed certain means, to wit: by inserting or causing to be inserted a certain instrument or instruments" with intent to procure miscarriage of a pregnant woman, in violation of this section did not reasonably indicate the exact offense so as to enable respondent to make intelligent preparation for his defense, and was fatally defective both at common law and under ch. I, art. 10, of the constitution of Vermont. State v. Rouillard, 107 Vt. 487, 180 A. 890 (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        Words "the same" referred to miscarriage, and an averment that the means were not necessary to preserve the woman's life, was not equivalent to an averment that the miscarriage was not necessary. State v. Stevenson, 68 Vt. 529, 35 A. 470 (1896).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since section contains excepting clause: "unless the same is necessary to preserve her life," indictment must negative the exception. State v. Stokes, 54 Vt. 179 (1881).

        Guilty plea to charge of willfully assisting the procuring of an abortion constituted an admission that the abortion was performed for a purpose other than saving the mother's life, which established the criminal intent necessary to support his conviction.

        If jury found as they might from evidence, that stories were invented by respondent to divert suspicion from himself, their introduction in evidence by him was circumstance tending to establish his guilt. State v. Marini, 106 Vt. 126, 170 A. 110 (1933).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence, that at time of operation, woman was in good health, strong and robust, and was working was sufficient proof that operation was not necessary to preserve her life to take case to jury. State v. Montifoire, 95 Vt. 508, 116 A. 77 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        Respondent's knowledge of pregnancy of woman and intent with which medicine was given her could be proved by circumstantial evidence. State v. Montifoire, 95 Vt. 508, 116 A. 77 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the fact of a deceased party's going to respondent's house for purpose of having him procure an abortion upon her person, was material, declaration of such person as to her purpose in going there, made at the time of her departure for that place, was competent evidence as part of the res gestae.

        If a marriage in fact is proved, another marriage set up to defeat it must also be proved in fact, and presumption arising from cohabitation and repute will not be sufficient. State v. Sherwood, 68 Vt. 414, 35 A. 352 (1896).

        In an animal cruelty case, even if the warrantless search of defendants' home was unconstitutional, an officer's affidavit in support of the search warrant included sufficient other evidence to establish probable cause, as both a contractor and defendants' landlord stated that the animals were kept for long periods in extremely cramped conditions and in their own feces and urine, and that at least one dog was losing fur, and their account was corroborated by a video the landlord took.

        Following defendant's conviction of cruelty to animals, not only did the trial court not have to determine defendant's ability to pay prior to ordering her to pay reasonable costs, it had no discretion to award any amount less than reasonable costs. The only discretion allowed to the trial court was to determine whether the claimed costs were reasonable. State v. Eldredge, 180 Vt. 278, 910 A.2d 816 (August 4, 2006).

         4. Costs.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Plain meaning of the animal cruelty enforcement statute empowers the trial court to determine whether the claimed costs were reasonable. State v. Sheperd, 204 Vt. 592, 170 A.3d 616 (June 2, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Following defendant's conviction of cruelty to animals, not only did the trial court not have to determine defendant's ability to pay prior to ordering her to pay reasonable costs, it had no discretion to award any amount less than reasonable costs. The only discretion allowed to the trial court was to determine whether the claimed costs were reasonable. State v. Eldredge, 180 Vt. 278, 910 A.2d 816 (August 4, 2006).

         5. Veterinarian Requirement.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In an animal cruelty case, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence on the ground that five horses had not been examined by a licensed veterinarian within 72 hours of defendant's voluntary surrender of them, as the veterinarian requirements throughout the animal cruelty statute were directed at animal welfare and not the privacy or evidentiary interests of individuals charged with animal cruelty. State v. St. Peter, 208 Vt. 1, 193 A.3d 1189 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the timing of a voluntary surrender cannot be predicted by a humane officer, and a voluntary surrender does not necessarily imply the level of urgency or danger to an animal that is required for a warrantless seizure or a seizure pursuant to a warrant, it makes sense that the Legislature has afforded humane officers somewhat more time to arrange a veterinary examination - 72 hours from the surrender - in the case of voluntary surrenders. If anything, this timing difference further reinforces that the veterinarian requirements throughout the animal cruelty statute are directed at animal welfare and not the privacy or evidentiary interests of individuals charged with animal cruelty. State v. St. Peter, 208 Vt. 1, 193 A.3d 1189 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Noncompliance with the veterinarian requirement of the provision governing search warrants in animal cruelty cases does not trigger the exclusionary rule and the suppression of evidence found during the search. Applying the exclusionary rule to guarantee statutory protections may be appropriate in some cases, but the requirement of a veterinarian's presence was not included to protect defendants; the veterinarian requirement stems from a concern for animal welfare and not for defendants' individual rights. State v. Sheperd, 204 Vt. 592, 170 A.3d 616 (June 2, 2017).

         6. Burden of proof.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Because the standard of proof in an animal cruelty forfeiture proceeding is clear and convincing evidence, the court will apply the same standard in a harmless-error analysis. State v. Ferguson, - Vt.
    - , 236 A.3d 207 (May 29, 2020).

         7. Evidence.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        With regard to forfeiture of the animals in an animal cruelty case, it was error to admit hearsay statements because the forfeiture statute did not create a hearsay exception for statements within the affidavit. Furthermore, the error was not harmless, requiring remand, because the trial court assigned significance to the duration of the animals' conditions in concluding that forfeiture was warranted, and apparently relied on the hearsay reports in the affidavit in assessing the duration of their conditions. State v. Ferguson, - Vt.
    - , 236 A.3d 207 (May 29, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Animal cruelty forfeiture statute creates an exception to the hearsay requirement for the affidavit itself, but it does not by its plain language create an exception for otherwise-inadmissible statements contained within the affidavit. State v. Ferguson, - Vt.
    - , 236 A.3d 207 (May 29, 2020).

       <p>
        In a prosecution for arson, testimony of a witness whose first examination of burned premises took place some fifteen months after fire, during which time at least some changes had taken place on premises, and whose conclusion is that he cannot make a finding as to cause of fire could not create such a clear case of doubt of the respondent's guilt as would entitle him to an acquittal. State v. Brown, 122 Vt. 59, 163 A.2d 845 (1960), cert. denied, 365 U.S. 822, 81 S. Ct. 706, 5 L. Ed. 2d 699 (1961).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Actions specifically prohibited by the arson-causing-death statute are defined by reference to the victim, and a defendant may therefore be charged with multiple counts of arson causing death where multiple deaths result from the same act of setting a fire. Thus, counsel was not ineffective for not raising a multiplicity challenge. In re Williams, 197 Vt. 39, 101 A.3d 151 (2014).

        This section denounces as an offense a number of separate and distinct acts, enumerated in the disjunctive. State v. Polidor, 130 Vt. 34, 285 A.2d 770 (1971).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The separate and distinct acts denounced as an offense by this section and enumerated in the disjunctive may be charged conjunctively, and an accused may be found guilty of any of the acts. State v. Polidor, 130 Vt. 34, 285 A.2d 770 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Use of word "and" in information and warrant charging that accused did "willfully and maliciously set fire to, burn and cause to be burned," demonstrated that information and warrant was worded in the conjunctive, and wording was proper under rule that statute making separate and distinct acts on offense and disjunctively worded may be charged in the conjunctive. State v. Polidor, 130 Vt. 34, 285 A.2d 770 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Information and warrant charging that defendant did "willfully and maliciously set fire to, burn and cause to be burned, a shop" was worded in the conjunctive, and although state's evidence indicated only that defendant participated in the planning of the fire, supplied flammable material and rendered sprinkling system useless, defendant could not prevail on claim that information and warrant were defective, that this materially prejudiced him, and that state should have filed a conjunctive information as to all the acts disjunctively enumerated in this section. State v. Polidor, 130 Vt. 34, 285 A.2d 770 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mere fact of burning of a building is not sufficient to establish corpus delicti in an arson prosecution, and if nothing more appears it will be presumed that the fire was the result of an accident or some providential cause, rather than the result of a criminal design. State v. Bessette, 129 Vt. 87, 271 A.2d 846 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        The jury was justified in finding beyond a reasonable doubt that the fire in question was of incendiary origin and the requisite willfulness and malicious intent was established by the performance of the act itself. State v. Bessette, 129 Vt. 87, 271 A.2d 846 (1970).

       </h5>
       <p>
        There was sufficient evidence to support defendant's conviction for two counts of arson, such that denial of his acquittal motion was proper; there was evidence that the fires were intentional based, in part, on the psychological doctrine of chances arising from two prior fires at his house. State v. Vuley, 193 Vt. 622, 70 A.3d 940 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Uncontradicted testimony of accomplices that they joined defendant in sprinkling gasoline in various rooms of farm house and that defendant struck match and ignited building was sufficient to sustain conviction under this section. State v. Crepeault, 126 Vt. 338, 229 A.2d 245, cert. denied, 389 U.S. 915, 88 S. Ct. 249, 19 L. Ed. 2d 267 (1967).

        In order to prove the corpus delicti of arson it is not sufficient to show a burning, which may have been the result of an accident; it must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt that burning was not accidental, but was willfully and maliciously caused by some person who was morally responsible for his actions. State v. Teitle, 117 Vt. 190, 90 A.2d 562 (1952).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where evidence at most raised a mere suspicion that fire was incendiary, respondent was entitled to a directed verdict. State v. Foss, 110 Vt. 453, 8 A.2d 648 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mere fact of burning is not sufficient to establish corpus delicti in prosecution for maliciously burning building, for if nothing more appears it will be presumed that fire was result of accident or providential cause, rather than result of criminal design, but incendiarism may be proved by circumstantial evidence. State v. Lizotte, 109 Vt. 378, 197 A. 396 (1938).

       <p>
        In such prosecution, that there were three simultaneous fires, two inside house and one in barn, that direction of wind was not from barn toward house, that windows in house were closed, and that there was no fire in stove, were sufficient to establish corpus delicti, since they would permit jury to find such three fires were not result of accidental or natural causes, but were willful act of some person. State v. Lizotte, 109 Vt. 378, 197 A. 396 (1938).

        In a charge of arson under this section, the burden is on the state to prove there was a burning; that the fire was incendiary and that the defendants willfully and maliciously set fire to the building. State v. Bishop & Jones, 127 Vt. 11, 238 A.2d 772 (1968).

       <p>
        Where evidence of the state established that there were no electrical connections in the shanty that burned, no smoking had taken place in the shack, nor were there any open containers of flammable material, jury was permitted to infer that the building did not catch fire in the way it did, and at the time it did, from some accidental or providential cause, but that such fire was incendiary. State v. Bishop & Jones, 127 Vt. 11, 238 A.2d 772 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence in arson prosecution was sufficient to support finding that the fire was incendiary and to support conviction of defendants. State v. Bishop & Jones, 127 Vt. 11, 238 A.2d 772 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendants' performance of act of burning building was sufficient to establish willfulness and malicious intent. State v. Bishop & Jones, 127 Vt. 11, 238 A.2d 772 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        If evidence offered to prove arson was entirely circumstantial every reasonable hypothesis must be excluded except that defendants were guilty. State v. Bishop & Jones, 127 Vt. 11, 238 A.2d 772 (1968).

        When respondent was discovered under circumstances where striking of a match would have consummated the arson, there was sufficient evidence to support submission of the charge of attempted arson to the jury under the rule that the preparation must be such that it would be likely to end in the consummation of the crime if not extraneously interrupted.

       </h5>
       <p>
        State's burden in assault and robbery prosecution was to prove that defendant intentionally put victim in fear of imminent, serious bodily injury and intentionally deprived him of money, intending to do so permanently. State v. Powell, 158 Vt. 280, 608 A.2d 45 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Specific intent to deprive person of property permanently is an element of offense of assault and robbery. State v. Francis, 151 Vt. 296, 561 A.2d 392 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Assault component of this section incorporates the elements of assault as defined in sections 1023 and 1021 of this title. State v. Francis, 151 Vt. 296, 561 A.2d 392 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Conviction for attempted assault and robbery requires proof that the accused intended to permanently deprive victim of property taken. State v. Dennis, 151 Vt. 223, 559 A.2d 670 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in refusing defendant's request to instruct jury that defendant could be convicted of aiding in the commission of a felony (bank robbery) only if he had the intent of permanently depriving the bank of its property, even though court's view of the intent element for assault and robbery was erroneous and the defendant's view was correct, where court's instruction on accessory liability was correct and specifically stated that defendant could be convicted only if he acted with same intent as that required for his accomplice. State v. Davignon, 152 Vt. 209, 565 A.2d 1301 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        As a matter of law, a gun, whether loaded or unloaded, is a dangerous weapon when used in the commission of a robbery; actual danger is not an element of the offense of assault and robbery with a dangerous weapon. State v. Parker, 139 Vt. 179, 423 A.2d 851 (1980), overruled on other grounds, State v. Derouchie (1981) 140 Vt. 437, 440 A.2d 146.

       <p>
        Information charging assault and robbery under subsec. (a) of this section was not defective for failure to state that defendant committed offense intentionally. State v. Francis, 151 Vt. 296, 561 A.2d 392 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where original information charged larceny and on day of trial, immediately before drawing of jury, court allowed amendment to charge additional element of assault. and thus armed robbery, an additional or different offense was clearly charged by the amended information, and it was error to refuse to grant request for continuance. State v. Holden, 136 Vt. 158, 385 A.2d 1092 (1978).

         3. Evidence.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Defendant failed in his argument that he took the gun from the victims to kill himself and, therefore, he did not intend to permanently deprive them of the gun because the evidence also showed that he intended to dispose of the gun such that he would not have had the ability to return the gun or ensure that it would be returned. State v. Little, 177 Vt. 612, 868 A.2d 686 (mem.) (December 13, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was properly convicted for two crimes, larceny from the person and attempted assault and robbery, where he committed larceny from the person of one victim by ripping a necklace with a coin off of her neck, and attempted assault and robbery by threatening to shoot that victim and her husband to gain access to their safe and its contents. State v. Setien, 173 Vt. 576, 795 A.2d 1135 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since attempted assault and robbery is a specific intent crime, evidence of intoxication may be considered to determine whether the accused acted with the required mental state for conviction. State v. Dennis, 151 Vt. 223, 559 A.2d 670 (1989).

         4. Instructions.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Crime of assault and robbery involves an implied element of intent permanently to deprive owner of property taken, but omission of implied element from charge is generally not plain error. State v. Gabert, 152 Vt. 83, 564 A.2d 1356 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jury instruction which failed to properly explain intent element of assault and robbery did not rise to level of plain error where question as to whether person who took victim's money had intent to deprive him of it permanently was not close or difficult. State v. Francis, 151 Vt. 296, 561 A.2d 392 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although assault is an essential element of the crime of assault and robbery, court's failure to issue separate instruction on assault as an element of robber trial for felony murder was not erroneous where the assault amounted to murder, whose elements had been fully explained to jury. State v. Wright, 154 Vt. 512, 581 A.2d 720 (1989), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1032, 111 S. Ct. 692, 112 L. Ed. 2d 682 (1991).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Though it has become customary in jurisprudence to refer to the term "assault and battery" as though it were a legal unit, a single concept, assault and battery are not synonymous terms. State v. Murphy, 128 Vt. 288, 262 A.2d 456 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Public peace is that sense of security and tranquility which every person feels under protection of law and breach of peace is an invasion of protection which law thus affords. State v. Sanderson, 123 Vt. 214, 185 A.2d 730 (1962).

         2. Elements of offense.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        An act can create the requisite "substantial risk of death" without causing permanent physical damage; choking is a good example of such an act. State v. Carpenter, 155 Vt. 59, 580 A.2d 497 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        An actual offer to use force to injure another is an assault, and the use of it is a battery. State v. Murphy, 128 Vt. 288, 262 A.2d 456 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not required that the person threatened must necessarily be put in fear to constitute a breach of peace. State v. Murphy, 128 Vt. 288, 262 A.2d 456 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Violation of this statute was supported by evidence that defendant, who had refused to leave auto not belonging to him upon request by police to do so, assaulted police officer both while in and out of auto by saying that he would kill him, and battered officer by striking him after he had left auto. State v. Murphy, 128 Vt. 288, 262 A.2d 456 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although terror usually accompanies crime of breach of peace in its aggravated form, fear is not an essential ingredient of offense, controlling factor being found in background and circumstances which attend alleged offense. State v. Sanderson, 123 Vt. 214, 185 A.2d 730 (1962).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        An assault is a demonstration of an unlawful intent by one person to inflict immediate injury on the person of another then present, and although physical contact is not an essential element, violence, threatened or offered, is. State v. Murphy, 128 Vt. 288, 262 A.2d 456 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        To sustain a criminal complaint for assault it is not the secret intent of the accused or the undisclosed fact of his ability or inability to commit battery that is material, but rather, what his conduct and the attending circumstances denote at the time to the person assaulted. State v. Murphy, 128 Vt. 288, 262 A.2d 456 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Simple assault is not a "specific intent" offense. State v. Murphy, 128 Vt. 288, 262 A.2d 456 (1970).

        Cuts police officer received on his hand during altercation with person he was arresting were "an impairment of physical condition" under this section, though they were not serious. State v. Allen, 139 Vt. 303, 427 A.2d 373 (1981).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court properly denied defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal of domestic assault. During a 911 recording, the complainant identified defendant and stated that she was beaten with his fists; the evidence contained in the 911 recording was supported by the responding officers' testimony and the photographs depicting the complainant's injuries; the evidence was sufficient to establish that by striking the complainant, defendant consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk of bodily injury; and the evidence admitted could reasonably convince a jury that the cut above the complainant's eye was a "bodily injury" and that the complainant was a household member. State v. Kelley, 202 Vt. 174, 148 A.3d 191 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence showing that the victim sustained a black eye, numerous bruises and abrasions, injury to her back, and two facial lacerations, one resulting in a permanent scar, was sufficient for the jury to conclude the victim sustained "substantial disfigurement." State v. Muscari, 174 Vt. 101, 807 A.2d 407 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the victim's permanent facial scar was not perceivable by the jury from across the courtroom, and the other injuries were temporary, the evidence was sufficient for the jury to conclude the victim sustained "substantial disfigurement"; neither visibility from a distance nor permanency is requisite to substantial disfigurement. State v. Muscari, 174 Vt. 101, 807 A.2d 407 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jury's determination of substantial disfigurement was not required to be supported by expert medical testimony because whether proof of an element of a crime meets the standard of "substantial" is not a medical determination, but is a question of fact for the jury. State v. Muscari, 174 Vt. 101, 807 A.2d 407 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for aggravated domestic assault, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal on the basis that there was insufficient evidence that the knife used in the assault was a deadly weapon, even though the knife itself was not entered in evidence, and the State instead relied entirely on the victim's testimony to prove this element of the crime. State v. Prior, 174 Vt. 49, 804 A.2d 770 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient for jury to reasonably find that assault victim's injuries, as well as his increased risk of glaucoma, constituted "serious bodily injury," and therefore defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal was properly denied. State v. Allen, 169 Vt. 615, 738 A.2d 113 (mem.) (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution for aggravated assault in which "substantial risk of death" is sought to be proved, expert medical testimony is not required to prove a victim is in substantial danger of death when medical expert testifies victim was choked to the point of passing out. State v. Carpenter, 155 Vt. 59, 580 A.2d 497 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Motion for acquittal at trial for aggravated assault was properly denied, based on testimony that defendant repeatedly forced adopted stepdaughter's head into bucket of water, that victim was unable to breathe, that defendant choked her and that she lost consciousness and vomited blood. State v. Carpenter, 155 Vt. 59, 580 A.2d 497 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Acquittal of defendant on sexual assault charge did not render his conviction on charge of aggravated assault logically inconsistent, where evidence was sufficient to show defendant submersed victim's head in a bucket of water and choked her in an attempt to silence her about actions he had good reason to believe constituted a sexual offense. State v. Carpenter, 155 Vt. 59, 580 A.2d 497 (1990).

       </p>
       <p>
        Allegation in an information that respondent "did then and there willfully and unlawfully disturb and break the public peace by assaulting another person, to wit . . ." is sufficient to support a conviction for breach of the peace. State v. Goodsell, 122 Vt. 99, 165 A.2d 356 (1960).

        Trial court was not required to instruct the jury on all four disjunctive elements of "serious bodily injury" where there was no evidence to support two of those elements. State v. Muscari, 174 Vt. 101, 807 A.2d 407 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's instruction on the medical expert testimony was proper where its purpose was to inform the jury that what is "serious bodily injury" is for the jury to decide, not anyone else; although an expert is allowed to testify as to the ultimate issue to be decided, that testimony is not entitled to any particular reverence; rather it is the province of the jury to determine what weight to accord expert witness testimony. State v. Muscari, 174 Vt. 101, 807 A.2d 407 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Charge that breach of the peace may be committed by acts or statements likely to produce violence and disturbance of good order although such is not intended, that a design to inflict the precise injury is not essential, that personal injury through reckless conduct may constitute assault and battery although there was no actual intent to inflict injury, and that an assault is an attempt or offer with force or violence or do bodily harm to another under circumstances denoting at the time an intention to do so coupled with a present ability to effect the intent, that an assault may go further than threatening motions such as a clenched fist under circumstances indicating actual intent to do harm with present ability to do it, and that an assault may be, and usually is, committed by the actual and intentional application of physical force, considered in its entirety, had general tenor that a demonstration of unlawful intent, rather than actual intent, constitutes the offense, and was not error. State v. Murphy, 128 Vt. 288, 262 A.2d 456 (1970).

        Trial court properly charged that voluntary intoxication was not a defense available to defendant accused of disturbing and breaking the public peace by assaulting, beating and striking a police officer. State v. Murphy, 128 Vt. 288, 262 A.2d 456 (1970).

        Police officer had reasonable grounds to request that defendant leave auto where officer was acting on police dispatcher's notification that the owner of the auto had complained that a man was in his auto and would not leave, and arrest for offense committed under this section in officer's presence was authorized where defendant refused to leave, left only after being maced and then used obscene language and threatened to kill officer.

       </p>
       <p>
        An assailed person may beat his assailant so far as to make him desist, but cannot take his life or inflict great bodily harm unless he reasonably apprehends death or great bodily harm to himself, and does not have other means of avoiding the attack that appear to him at the time as sufficient and available and they are in fact not sufficient and available.

        It was not required that person threatened should necessarily be put in fear to constitute a breach of peace. State v. Wixon, 118 Vt. 495, 114 A.2d 410 (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to secure a conviction on charge of breach of the peace the state must show more than a mere possibility that the respondent's act might produce violence or a disturbance of public peace. State v. Thompson, 117 Vt. 70, 84 A.2d 594 (1951).

        Threats of great bodily harm, accompanied by acts showing a formed intention to put them in execution, if intended to put person threatened in fear of their execution, and if they had that effect, and were calculated to produce that effect upon a person of ordinary firmness, constituted a breach of public peace, which was punishable by indictment.

         *14. Force in defense of self or property.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        A person does not have the right to use physical force in defense of his property against a person legally on the premises unless he has first asked him to leave and given him a reasonable opportunity to do so. State v. Bogie, 125 Vt. 414, 217 A.2d 51 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        While unlawful arrest may be lawfully resisted, right of resistance, being in nature of self-defense, permits arrested person to use only such amount of force as reasonably appears to him to be necessary under circumstances. State v. Malnati, 109 Vt. 429, 199 A. 249 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where court charged that a person in charge of property delivered to him to be kept is not justified in assaulting a trespasser in the first instance but must first require trespasser to depart, and then use only such force as is reasonably necessary to expel him, but if trespasser first uses violence, then person in charge, without a request to depart, may use violence in return; exception taken thereto on ground that notice is not necessary before person in charge may proceed to expel trespasser by force is not good. State v. Bean, 107 Vt. 513, 180 A. 882 (1935).

         15. Serious bodily injury.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        By its 1993 amendment of the definition of "serious bodily injury," the legislature intended that a conviction for aggravated assault can be sustained on evidence of "substantial disfigurement" that need not be "serious, permanent disfigurement." State v. Muscari, 174 Vt. 101, 807 A.2d 407 (2002).

         16. Deadly weapon.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Because an object can be found to be a deadly weapon if it is objectively capable of causing harm, the box cutter here, which defendant was using to cut boxes and which thus could be understood to have sharp edges and to be capable of producing death or serious injury despite its unusual design, was a deadly weapon for purposes of conviction under the domestic assault statute. State v. Kuzawski, 206 Vt. 351, 181 A.3d 62 (Dec. 15, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Firearm employed in a threat against a family or household member need not be shown to be operable or loaded to constitute a deadly weapon; in the context of first-degree aggravated domestic assault, it is entirely irrelevant if a rifle brandished to punctuate a threat was loaded and able to fire when the threat was made, because this crime does not require an imminent threat. Consequently, a firearm did not have to be proven to be loaded and operable, immediately or otherwise, to constitute a deadly weapon in a prosecution for first-degree aggravated domestic assault, and the trial court did not err by omitting such a requirement in its instructions to the jury. State v. Longley, 182 Vt. 452, 939 A.2d 1028 (Oct. 12, 2007).

       <p>
        Adoption in 1972 of Model Penal Code provisions relating to assault, including provision that a person is guilty of simple assault if he negligently causes bodily injury to another with a deadly weapon, repealed by implication 1931 law intended to encourage hunters to be careful and providing that one carelessly or negligently wounding another by gunshot shall be imprisoned or fined, for it is evident that both statutes cover the same subject and in such a case the statute which is the more recent will control, as it is the latest expression of the legislative will. State v. Watson, 138 Vt. 276, 413 A.2d 806 (1980).

       <p>
        Model Penal Code provision adopted in 1972, providing that a person is guilty of simple assault if he negligently causes bodily injury to another with a deadly weapon, and 1931 law intended to encourage hunters to be careful and providing that one carelessly or negligently wounding another by gunshot shall be imprisoned or fined, cannot logically stand together, for while the former is a misdemeanor and the latter a felony, the latter requires a less culpable state of mind; therefore, the former would be held to repeal the latter by implication.

       <p>
        Where defendant was charged with attempting by physical menace to put another in fear of serious bodily injury under subdivision (a)(3) of this section, the question of whether or not the defendant's actions amounted to a simple assault was a question for the jury, to be resolved based upon all the surrounding circumstances, including the words spoken, the appearance and demeanor of the parties, and their conduct in light of the setting and circumstances. State v. Riley, 141 Vt. 29, 442 A.2d 1297 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        When persons attending an appointed lawful meeting of any description conduct themselves in a manner lawful in itself, but at variance with purpose of gathering and inconsistent with its orderly procedure, it will ordinarily be for jury to say whether their conduct was such as amounted, in circumstances, to a disturbance of peace.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Error in admitting the victim's testimonial statement to an officer was not harmless because the victim's statement that she felt pain was the most direct evidence presented by the State on the question of bodily injury, a required element of simple assault by recklessly causing bodily injury. State v. Alers, 199 Vt. 373, 123 A.3d 825 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was not entitled to a judgment of acquittal on a charge of simple assault by recklessly causing bodily injury, as even in the absence of the victim's inadmissible statements, a reasonable jury could infer that the victim experienced pain when the State presented eyewitness testimony that with his arms around the victim's neck, defendant dragged her backwards toward a vehicle, that the victim was in a "chokehold," that defendant jostled her "like a ragged doll," and that the victim was screaming, "freaked out," and "beyond herself." State v. Alers, 199 Vt. 373, 123 A.3d 825 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant and another scuffled, defendant picked up a bottle and the other person picked up a rock and defendant advanced upon the other person, who backed up, at which time law enforcement officers arrived, and defendant never came closer than ten feet to the other person and did not attempt to throw the bottle or lunge toward the other person, conviction of simple assault in that defendant attempted to cause bodily injury to the other person would be reversed. State v. Boutin, 133 Vt. 531, 346 A.2d 531 (1975).

       <p>
        Intoxication does not negate the element of recklessness in subdivision (a)(1) of this section. State v. Galvin, 147 Vt. 215, 514 A.2d 705 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant, who was convicted of impeding and assaulting a police officer, claimed that he had been pushed into the officer and acted in self-defense when the officer tried to handcuff him after the initial contact, since the assault complaint related back to the initial contact, any subsequent facts were irrelevant, and could not be superimposed to form the basis of a self-defense charge to the jury. State v. Mitchell, 142 Vt. 517, 458 A.2d 1089 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution for assault of a police officer involving provocative conduct by the police, the jury, having been correctly charged on self-defense, was free to decide that the defendant's actions were not reasonable under the circumstances. State v. Desjardins, 142 Vt. 255, 454 A.2d 1230 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Husband who was prevented by restraining order from being at the home of his estranged wife was not protecting himself from forceable removal from his property when police forcibly removed him from wife's home, he resisted, and blows were struck; and he was properly convicted of unlawful trespass and of recklessly causing bodily injury to a law enforcement officer performing a lawful duty. State v. Foster, 139 Vt. 18, 421 A.2d 1284 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant, tried for assault upon law enforcement officer who had attempted to serve process on defendant in his home, testified that as he walked down hall in his home someone jumped out at him and shoved something toward his face and he put his hands up to block the object and in doing so struck the officer, there was sufficient evidence to necessitate a charge on self-defense, and it was reversible error to refuse to give one.

         7. Elements.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Since simple assault requires an attempt to cause bodily injury or an attempt to put another in fear of imminent serious bodily injury, while attempted sexual assault does not necessarily require such an act or attempt, simple assault is not a lesser included offense of attempted sexual assault. In re Nash, 149 Vt. 63, 539 A.2d 989 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Holding of supreme court in
        State v. Deso
        , 110 Vt. 1, 1 A.2d 710 (1938), which rejected the notion that present ability to inflict injury upon the person assailed was a prerequisite to a finding of simple assault is still valid even though this section has been amended since that case was decided. State v. Riley, 141 Vt. 29, 442 A.2d 1297 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        As a prerequisite to a finding of simple assault, while there must be some power to do bodily harm, either actual or apparent, apparent power alone would be sufficient. State v. Riley, 141 Vt. 29, 442 A.2d 1297 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant charged under subdiv. (a)(3) of this section with attempting by physical menace to put another in fear of serious bodily injury possessed in the course of the alleged incident a handgun lacking a firing pin which therefore could not fire, his contention that the police officer assailed could not be put in actual danger as a result failed, since as a prerequisite to a finding of simple assault, while there must be some power to do bodily harm, either actual or apparent, apparent power alone would be sufficient. State v. Riley, 141 Vt. 29, 442 A.2d 1297 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Simple assault requires proof of bodily injury or an attempt to cause bodily injury, an element not identical to an element of sexual assault or always necessarily included in the elements of sexual assault; therefore, one charged with sexual assault is not entitled to a jury instruction on simple assault.

        Regarding this section's provision that a person is guilty of simple assault if he negligently causes bodily injury to another with a deadly weapon, a state of mind more flagrant than ordinary negligence is required; the risk must be of such a nature and degree that the actor's failure to perceive it, considering the nature and purpose of his conduct and the circumstances known to him, involves a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the actor's situation. State v. Watson, 138 Vt. 276, 413 A.2d 806 (1980).

       <p>
        The language of subdiv. (a)(3) of this section that sets forth an attempt by physical menace to put another in fear of serious bodily injury was intended to incorporate into the criminal law the civil notion of assault, that an action may be maintained against a person who places another in fear of bodily injury, even if the alleged assailant acts without purpose to carry out the threat. State v. Riley, 141 Vt. 29, 442 A.2d 1297 (1982).

       <p>
        Rationale for including the civil notion of assault, that an action may be maintained against a person who places another in fear of bodily injury even if the alleged assailant acts without purpose to carry out the threat, within the definition of simple assault set forth in subdiv. (a)(3) of this section, is that a threat of an immediate battery resulting in apprehension, even when intended only as a bluff, is so likely to result in a breach of the peace that it should be a punishable offense. State v. Riley, 141 Vt. 29, 442 A.2d 1297 (1982).

        Action of court, during trial of defendant charged as a principal in offense of simple assault by recklessly causing bodily injury, in permitting state to offer evidence that defendant was acting as an accomplice did not improperly deprive defendant of opportunity to adequately or timely prepare a defense to charge that she was acting as an accomplice because charged offense was a misdemeanor, defendant could be informed against, tried and convicted as a principal, irrespective of whether the nature of defendant's participation in the commission of the offense was as a principal or an accomplice.

         11. Instructions.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In the case of the defendant charged with attempting by physical menace to put another in fear of serious bodily injury under subdiv. (a)(3) of this section, the court properly instructed the jury that in determining whether or not the defendant intended to place the person assailed, a police officer, in fear they should consider both the bare actions of the defendant and how those actions were perceived by the officer. State v. Riley, 141 Vt. 29, 442 A.2d 1297 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        On review of a conviction of simple assault against a police officer, the supreme court could not conclude that the trial court's instructions distinguishing between the enhanced crime of assault of a police officer under section 1028 of this title and simple assault so prejudiced the defendant as to deprive him of a right to a fair trial and mandate reversal, where the jury returned a verdict of not guilty on all counts of assault against one of the two officers and a not guilty verdict on the charge of assault and a guilty verdict only on the charge of simple assault against the other officer. State v. Desjardins, 142 Vt. 255, 454 A.2d 1230 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution for assault of a police officer, the trial court's instructions, when viewed as a whole, properly instructed the jury on the enhanced crime of assault of a police officer under section 1028 of this title and the crime of simple assault where the court carefully and clearly explained each element of assault of a police officer and correctly distinguished the lesser included offense of simple assault, repeatedly emphasized the need to weigh all the circumstances, both to determine the lawfulness of the police conduct and to determine the reasonableness of the defendant's response, and instructed that this section has nothing to do with the status of the individual as a police officer and is without regard to whether the individual was acting in the performance of a lawful duty; the instruction that none of the acts of search and seizure were in themselves unlawful did not remove an essential element of the crime from the jury's consideration where the instructions also clearly were that, if the jury found that "the officer himself committed an assault, or used excessive force in dealing with the defendant prior to striking, then he was not performing a lawful duty and you [the jury] must find defendant not guilty." State v. Desjardins, 142 Vt. 255, 454 A.2d 1230 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, in prosecution for simple assault by recklessly causing bodily injury, court instructed jury that it could consider whether defendant was guilty of charged offense or of a lesser included offense, simple assault by mutual consent, and instructed jury that it could convict defendant as an accomplice even if it found defendant had caused no specific bodily injury to victim, jury verdict finding defendant guilty of simple assault by consent required a finding that the defendant had actually entered into a fight or struggle with the victim and that the defendant was liable as a principal, and, therefore, the portion of the court's instruction on the law of accomplice liability was surplusage and did not vitiate the remainder of the instruction. State v. Sturgeon, 140 Vt. 240, 436 A.2d 777 (1981).

         12. Lesser included offenses
        </b>
        .
       </h5>
       <p>
        Difference between aggravated assault and simple assault lay in the required mental state: intent to prevent in the aggravated assault charge and intent to harm - or doing so knowingly or recklessly - for simple assault. Because the requisite mental element was different for each charge, simple assault was not a lesser included element of aggravated assault as charged, and omitting an instruction on simple assault was not an error. State v. Myers, 190 Vt. 29, 26 A.3d 9 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although simple assault by negligently causing bodily injury to another with a deadly weapon is a lesser included offense of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, defendant was not entitled to an instruction on simple assault. Defendant drew a knife on an unarmed man at close range and aimed it at several vital areas. State v. Russell, 189 Vt. 632, 22 A.3d 455 (mem.) (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the only difference in the offenses of aggravated assault and simple assault involves whether a deadly weapon was used, where there was no evidence in the case of an assault without a deadly weapon, the trial judge properly held that the jury could not convict defendant of simple assault without convicting him of aggravated assault, and, in these circumstances, the lesser-included offense instruction was inappropriate. State v. Russo, 177 Vt. 394, 864 A.2d 655 (October 8, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant charged with aggravated assault failed in his request that the trial court charge simple assault under the provision of this section that "[a] person is guilty of simple assault if he attempts by physical menace to put another in fear of imminent serious bodily injury" because the aggravated assault statute, 13 V.S.A.
        §
        1024, does not contain this element; accordingly, the court properly held that defendant was not entitled to a lesser-included offense instruction. State v. Russo, 177 Vt. 394, 864 A.2d 655 (October 8, 2004).

       <p>
        One of criminal law's most basic principles is that a person is not criminally liable for causing a bad result if he or she did not have some culpable mental state with respect to that result; a person's criminal liability for an act should be proportioned to his or her moral culpability for that act. To remain distinct from the related misdemeanor, felony aggravated assault with a deadly weapon requires greater culpability than reckless conduct. State v. Bourn, 192 Vt. 270, 58 A.3d 236 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Conviction for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon requires that the actor subjectively intend to threaten another person with a deadly weapon; accordingly, the accused is entitled to assert appropriate defenses that rebut the State's arguments on this point. Because the jury charge at defendant's trial was not consistent with this holding, he was entitled to a new trial on these counts. State v. Bourn, 192 Vt. 270, 58 A.3d 236 (2012).
       </p>

        Aggravated assault with a deadly weapon is a specific-intent crime. State v. Bourn, 192 Vt. 270, 58 A.3d 236 (2012).

        Trial counsel was ineffective when she failed to obtain expert testimony to refute the most important - and weakest - element in the State's case: whether petitioner fired his gun at the complaining witness. Because intent to injure was the central element to a charge of aggravated assault, the issue of shot direction was vital to the State's case; counsel actually bolstered the State's case by eliciting damaging testimony from a State's witness, and she hamstrung petitioner's case by lacking rebuttal evidence to support the contention that directionality could not be determined based on a muzzle flash.

        Trial court erred in denying motion for acquittal of defendant charged with aggravated assault based on an alleged intent to prevent a game warden from performing a lawful duty by causing him physical injury in violation of subdiv.

        This section, making it aggravated assault if a person "attempts to cause or purposely or knowingly causes bodily injury to another with a deadly weapon," makes the mental element of either purpose or knowledge a necessary element of the offense, and the concept of purpose and knowledge corresponds to the common law concept of specific intent, both concepts importing a conscious intent or design to act as charged.

         9. Jury instruction.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In its charge on aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, the trial court did not err in declining to instruct the jury that "threaten" meant "to express one's intent to harm or kill someone." As the trial court explained, there was a danger that including the definition proffered by defendant would confuse the jury as to the element of intent. State v. Dow, 202 Vt. 616, 152 A.3d 437 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        As a whole, the instructions on aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and attempted simple assault by physical menace breathed the true spirit and doctrine of the law. The instructions, while referring to defendant's "secret intent," also provided detail about the intent elements for both offenses; even though the trial court did not use the words "specific intent," the instructions adequately explained the required subjective moral culpability by stating that the jury was required to find defendant actually intended to threaten police officers. State v. Dow, 202 Vt. 616, 152 A.3d 437 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        While in a portion of its spoken instruction concerning the intent element of the aggravated assault charge, the trial court improperly required the State to prove that defendant placed another person in fear of imminent bodily injury, rather than focusing the jury on the effect of defendant's words or deeds on a reasonable person in similar circumstances, any error was harmless in the context of the overall instruction and given the record in this case. Nothing in the trial court's instruction suggested that the determination of whether a communication conveyed such an intent was a subjective one that turned on the victim's perception. State v. Gagne, 202 Vt. 255, 148 A.3d 986 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence here did not support an instruction on self-defense or defense-of-others, either as provided by statute for purposes of the aggravated assault charge or under the common law, and the trial court did not commit plain error by failing to sua sponte instruct the jury on these defenses. Defendant did not admit the elements of the charged crimes but claimed innocence, the failure to request the instructions was likely trial strategy, and the record did not support a finding that defendant believed that he and another person were in immediate danger of unlawful bodily harm. State v. Buckley, 202 Vt. 371, 149 A.3d 928 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the jury instructions on aggravated assault did not include an exact reference to specific "subjective" intent, there was no plain error. They still made clear that there could be no conviction without proof that defendant's message was to threaten injury to another, and that it was the State's burden to prove defendant communicated an intent to injure. State v. Cahill, 194 Vt. 335, 80 A.3d 52 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        In its charge on aggravated assault, the trial court eliminated the State's burden of proving that defendant specifically intended to drug the two named girls when it instructed the jury that "[t]he State is not required to prove, but may prove, that the defendant intended that a specific person be harmed in this manner." Because defendant admitted at trial that he deliberately gave "stupefying drugs" to his wife, the instruction virtually assured that the jury would find him guilty of aggravated assault, which was constitutional error requiring a new trial. State v. Kolibas, 191 Vt. 474, 48 A.3d 610 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        "Injury," for the purposes of the aggravated assault statute, meant "physical pain, illness or any impairment of physical condition." When asked if he suffered any physical pain from the kick, the officer in question testified that "[t]here was some discomfort, yes"; while "discomfort" and "pain" were not strictly synonymous, the officer's testimony was sufficient to support defendant's conviction on this charge beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Myers, 190 Vt. 29, 26 A.3d 9 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if the omission of a diminished capacity instruction based on intoxication was an error, it was not prejudicial. Defendant never raised the issue of his intent with regard to the aggravated assault charges against him. State v. Myers, 190 Vt. 29, 26 A.3d 9 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because defendant was charged with only "purposely" causing serious bodily injury, the trial court's instruction on the mens rea of "knowingly" was erroneous. State v. Trombley, 174 Vt. 459, 807 A.2d 400 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court's inclusion of "knowingly" in jury instructions was harmless error because defendant's own assertion of self-defense established that he acted with the purpose of inflicting serious bodily injury on the victim. State v. Trombley, 174 Vt. 459, 807 A.2d 400 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court's instructions were a correct statement of the law and did not mislead the jury where they started with the charge against defendant of knocking the victim's teeth out in an altercation and then discussed how the aggressor in a conflict could claim self-defense when met with deadly force; the instructions focused on the relevant time frame and made it clear to the jury that if they found defendant was not acting reasonably during the altercation, as opposed to during his earlier pursuit of the victim, then he was not acting lawfully in self-defense. State v. Trombley, 174 Vt. 459, 807 A.2d 400 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was incorrect in claiming that the jury should have been given an instruction that he had to intend the crime of aggravated assault to be convicted under 13 V.S.A.
        §
        1024; the statute has three theories of criminal liability for aggravated assault and one of those theories is based on recklessness but does not require intent; the jury instructions mirror the words of the statute and the instructions are valid.

       <p>
        Difference between aggravated assault and simple assault lay in the required mental state: intent to prevent in the aggravated assault charge and intent to harm - or doing so knowingly or recklessly - for simple assault. Because the requisite mental element was different for each charge, simple assault was not a lesser included element of aggravated assault as charged, and omitting an instruction on simple assault was not an error. State v. Myers, 190 Vt. 29, 26 A.3d 9 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although simple assault by negligently causing bodily injury to another with a deadly weapon is a lesser included offense of aggravated assault with a deadly weapon, defendant was not entitled to an instruction on simple assault. Defendant drew a knife on an unarmed man at close range and aimed it at several vital areas. State v. Russell, 189 Vt. 632, 22 A.3d 455 (mem.) (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the only difference in the offenses of aggravated assault and simple assault involves whether a deadly weapon was used, where there was no evidence in the case of an assault without a deadly weapon, the trial judge properly held that the jury could not convict defendant of simple assault without convicting him of aggravated assault, and, in these circumstances, the lesser-included offense instruction was inappropriate. State v. Russo, 177 Vt. 394, 864 A.2d 655 (October 8, 2004).
       </p>

        §§
        1023(a)(1) that "[a] person is guilty of simple assault if he attempts by physical menace to put another in fear of imminent serious bodily injury" because this section does not contain this element; accordingly, the court properly held that defendant was not entitled to a lesser-included offense instruction.

        There was sufficient evidence that defendant had the specific intent required to prove aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and attempted simple assault by physical menace. While some facts could support a finding that defendant harbored an intent to harm himself at certain times during the incident, the circumstantial evidence, particularly the fact that defendant was angrily running down the hall toward the officers carrying a knife, was sufficient for the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant acted with the specific intent to threaten the officers State v. Dow, 202 Vt. 616, 152 A.3d 437 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        With regard to an aggravated assault conviction, the evidence that defendant armed himself with a .45 pistol, stood 25 yards away from and pointed his gun at a farmhand, and then fired into the woods for emphasis was sufficient to show that he had the specific intent to threaten. His motive to publicize his cause was not inconsistent with, and did not negate, an intent to threaten the farmhand with the pistol to achieve that end. State v. Cahill, 194 Vt. 335, 80 A.3d 52 (2013).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Defendant's convictions for aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and attempted simple assault by physical menace violated the Double Jeopardy Clause of the Fifth Amendment, as the simple assault was a lesser included offense of the aggravated assault charge. State v. Dow, 202 Vt. 616, 152 A.3d 437 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        As charged, litigated, and instructed, the aggravated assault charge and the reckless endangerment charge each required an element of proof not required for the other charge and thus there was no double jeopardy violation in convicting defendant of both crimes. Although the reckless endangerment charge and the aggravated assault charge both related to defendant's pointing a gun at the complainants, an essential element of the reckless endangerment charge was that the firearm defendant pointed was operable and capable of causing death or serious bodily injury, while the trial court instructed the jury that the aggravated assault charge required proof that defendant intended to threaten another. State v. Gagne, 202 Vt. 255, 148 A.3d 986 (2016).

        One of criminal law's most basic principles is that a person is not criminally liable for causing a bad result if he or she did not have some culpable mental state with respect to that result; a person's criminal liability for an act should be proportioned to his or her moral culpability for that act. To remain distinct from the related misdemeanor, felony aggravated assault with a deadly weapon requires greater culpability than reckless conduct. State v. Bourn, 192 Vt. 270, 58 A.3d 236 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendment to this section adding the phrase "whether or not the firearm actually was loaded" did not do away with the requirement that the State demonstrate that a gun involved in a violation of the statute was operable. State v. Messier, 178 Vt. 412, 885 A.2d 1193 (August 19, 2005).

         2. Constitutionality.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Unlawful-act manslaughter predicated on reckless endangerment was not unconstitutionally vague when applied to facts of case because recognition of duty to disclose material defects to buyers predated sale of defendant's home and evidence indicated, and jury found, that defendant's failure to warn buyers of driveway heater's dangerous condition amounted to reckless endangerment because defendant knew that the heater was not repaired when he sold the home. State v. Brooks, 163 Vt. 245, 658 A.2d 22 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although supreme court could not specify every set of facts which constitute reckless conduct, the recklessness standard on which involuntary manslaughter is predicated is sufficiently precise to prevent it from being arbitrarily applied; scope of conduct which may be deemed reckless is sufficiently narrowed by the requirement that the risk, when objectively viewed, amounts to a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a law-abiding person would observe in the actor's situation. State v. Brooks, 163 Vt. 245, 658 A.2d 22 (1995).

        On question of charge of breach of peace by respondent who resisted officer arresting him without warrant, regardless of whether loitering of respondent shown did or did not amount to technical breach of peace, inasmuch as this section was passed as preventive measure and amounts to legislative declaration that loitering on streets endangers peace and tranquility of community, arrest was lawful under rule permitting officer in certain circumstances to interfere to prevent breach of peace.

        In enacting this section, the legislature intended to proscribe conduct which would place the victim in actual danger of death or serious bodily injury, not mere apparent danger. State v. Emilo, 146 Vt. 277, 501 A.2d 1188 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution under this section, whether the victim was placed in an objective state of danger is an issue of fact. State v. Emilo, 146 Vt. 277, 501 A.2d 1188 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution under this section, whether a firearm was unloaded or was otherwise inoperative is an essential issue in determining whether the victim was placed in an objective state of danger of death or serious bodily harm. State v. Emilo, 146 Vt. 277, 501 A.2d 1188 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution under this section, there was no error as a matter of law in a finding that police officer was placed in an objective state of danger by being threatened with a loaded but uncocked single action revolver, even though the gun had to be manually cocked before the trigger would operate.

        Defendant was not entitled to acquittal of reckless endangerment and unlawful mischief, as there was sufficient evidence that he threw a pry bar at a truck when the driver testified that he saw a man in the road holding a large object, which shattered his windshield, there was a divot in the snow where an object apparently bounced off the windshield, police found a pry bar with a broken orange handle inside the home where defendant worked, and the windshield contained orange fragments. State v. Redmond, - Vt.
    - , 234 A.3d 958 (May 15, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        As charged, litigated, and instructed, the aggravated assault charge and the reckless endangerment charge each required an element of proof not required for the other charge and thus there was no double jeopardy violation in convicting defendant of both crimes. Although the reckless endangerment charge and the aggravated assault charge both related to defendant's pointing a gun at the complainants, an essential element of the reckless endangerment charge was that the firearm defendant pointed was operable and capable of causing death or serious bodily injury, while the trial court instructed the jury that the aggravated assault charge required proof that defendant intended to threaten another. State v. Gagne, 202 Vt. 255, 148 A.3d 986 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Information charging defendant with reckless endangerment was sufficient. The language of the information was drawn from the statute and was sufficient on its face to inform defendant of the crime in question; the two accompanying affidavits clearly described defendant's reckless operation of his truck, including its impact with the complaining witness's home and the resulting damage, and the fact that the truck struck the room of the complaining witness's daughter; and defendant made no showing that the perceived lack of clarity in the information prejudiced his defense. State v. Myers, 190 Vt. 29, 26 A.3d 9 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant failed in his argument that the district court erred in denying his motion for acquittal from the crime of reckless endangerment based on the insufficiency of evidence of the gun's operability, where there was testimony and a demonstration regarding the gun's pump action, shells were found in defendant's vehicle, the gun itself was entered into evidence and available for the jury's inspection, defendant adduced no evidence that the gun was not operable, and the gun was not a rusty antique; further, the State was not required to undertake ballistics or other laboratory testing in order to meet its burden on operability. State v. Messier, 178 Vt. 412, 885 A.2d 1193 (August 19, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where trial court in reckless endangerment proceeding instructed jury that whether rifle allegedly used by defendant was loaded or not was of no importance, instruction was erroneous since legislature, when it enacted this section, intended to proscribe conduct which would place the victim in actual danger of death or serious bodily injury, not mere apparent danger, and consequently, decision in State v. Cushman (1974) 133 Vt. 121, 329 A.2d 648 would be overruled. State v. McLaren, 135 Vt. 291, 376 A.2d 34 (1977).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Defendant charged with aggravated assault was not entitled to a lesser-included offense instruction on reckless endangerment because that offense is not composed of elements from the offense of aggravated assault. State v. Russo, 177 Vt. 394, 864 A.2d 655 (October 8, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Reckless endangerment is not a lesser-included offense of common law manslaughter since the unlawful act necessary to sustain a conviction for manslaughter could be reckless or negligent, and, therefore, the offense of reckless endangerment has an element not necessarily included in the offense of manslaughter. State v. Forbes, 147 Vt. 612, 523 A.2d 1232 (1987).

         7. Instructions.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Jury instructions on reckless endangerment were insufficient because they did not inform the jury that reckless endangerment required proof that a firearm was operable. State v. Longley, 182 Vt. 452, 939 A.2d 1028 (Oct. 12, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant was charged with reckless endangerment for "aiming his car at a Vermont State Police cruiser" and the jury specifically asked whether the State had to prove that defendant aimed his car at a state police cruiser and additionally restated the question: "in other words - is 'aiming' a part of the [crime]," the trial court erred in instructing that "[a]iming the car is not an essential element of the charge of reckless endangerment" because a reasonable juror would not have understood from the court's response that the State had to prove that defendant aimed his car at the cruiser. State v. Brown, 179 Vt. 22, 890 A.2d 79 (August 26, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although involuntary manslaughter defendant argued that instruction defining recklessness was flawed because it incorporated both the criminal negligence and recklessness standards but did not distinguish between the two, contrary to defendant's suggestion, both recklessness and criminal negligence require an objective view of risk; the difference is one of degree. State v. Brooks, 163 Vt. 245, 658 A.2d 22 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court properly instructed the jury to objectively assess the risk and to determine whether involuntary manslaughter defendant consciously disregarded that risk; for further clarification, it referred the jury to the reckless endangerment instruction, which expressly required a finding that defendant actually knew from the circumstances then existing that the heater had not properly been repaired. State v. Brooks, 163 Vt. 245, 658 A.2d 22 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        If there was any flaw in jury instruction in involuntary manslaughter prosecution, it stemmed from the court's use of the term "reasonable-person" instead of "law-abiding person" when describing the standard for objectively assessing the nature of the risk; this does not amount to plain error. State v. Brooks, 163 Vt. 245, 658 A.2d 22 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, under provision of this section relating to pointing a gun at or in the direction of another, state alleged defendant pointed a gun at a state trooper and gave evidence that defendant pointed gun in trooper's direction and judge charged the jury that it need only find the weapon was aimed in the general direction of the trooper, the instruction was not such a material variance between allegation and proof as to be reversible error. State v. Cushman, 133 Vt. 121, 329 A.2d 648 (1974), overruled on other grounds, State v. McLaren (1977) 135 Vt. 291, 376 A.2d 34.

         1. Constitutionality.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Statutory text of the portion of the disorderly conduct statute pertaining to disturbing any lawful assembly or meeting treats brief outbursts of speech - the content of which may merely be objectionable to the sensibilities of some (or all) of those assembled - the same as prolonged, voluminous speech that, for example, drowns out the primary speaker, preventing audience members from hearing the speaker. If the court were to apply this statute according to its terms, it would criminalize heckling, interrupting, harsh questioning, booing, and all manner of speech that has been tolerated pursuant to the rights accorded to the peoples of free societies; thus, the statute, as worded, impermissibly sanctions a substantial amount of protected speech even when considered in relation to its legitimate scope. State v. Colby, 185 Vt. 464, 972 A.2d 197 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Central constitutional tension presented by the disorderly conduct statute pertaining to disturbing any lawful assembly or meeting arises from a clash of two fundamental First Amendment rights - freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. In construing the statute, the court must ensure that neither fundamental right is unnecessarily sacrificed for the sake of the other. State v. Colby, 185 Vt. 464, 972 A.2d 197 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        To show that a defendant violated the disorderly conduct statute pertaining to disturbing any lawful assembly or meeting, the State must prove that a defendant's conduct -
    and not the content of the activity's expression - substantially impaired the effective conduct of a meeting. Narrowing the reach of the statute in such a fashion strikes the proper balance between the two fundamental rights implicated by the statute, freedom of speech and freedom of assembly. State v. Colby, 185 Vt. 464, 972 A.2d 197 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Assuming that a reasonable police officer could have interpreted the disorderly conduct statute to cover plaintiff's statement at a roadblock, such an officer nonetheless could not have believed that such an interpretation was constitutionally valid. A reasonable officer would have understood that arresting plaintiff merely for uttering an expletive violated plaintiff's clearly established right to free speech, and in turn, his right not to be arrested without probable cause. Based on such evidence, defendant did not act in good faith and was not entitled to official immunity. Long v. L'Esperance, 166 Vt. 566, 701 A.2d 1048 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        In light of the action of the Legislature in amending paragraph (3) to conform to the language of the Model Penal Code, and the intent of the Model Code drafters to limit the reach of the "abusive language" provision to "fighting words," paragraph (3) is properly construed as proscribing only "fighting words." Prosecution under that provision is thus appropriate only when a defendant's spoken words, when directed to another person in a public place, with the explicit intent to cause public inconvenience, or annoyance or recklessly create a risk thereof, tend to incite an immediate breach of the peace. State v. Read, 165 Vt. 141, 680 A.2d 944 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        As applied to defendant who yelled, kicked and attempted to bite a police officer during her arrest, this section is not unconstitutionally vague, since it is sufficiently clear to inform a person of reasonable intelligence that the kind of conduct engaged in by defendant is prohibited. State v. Begins, 147 Vt. 45, 509 A.2d 1007 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Provision of this section relating to vehicular or pedestrian traffic is neither unconstitutionally vague nor unconstitutionally over broad. Arbeitman v. District Court of Vermont, 522 F.2d 1031 (2d Cir. 1975).

         2. Obstruction.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Term "obstructs," as it appears in statute, must be presumed to have ordinary meaning of the word, and, in charge to jury, definition of word as found in both Webster's Seventh New Collegiate Dictionary and Black's Law Dictionary was not error. State v. Arbeitman, 131 Vt. 596, 313 A.2d 17 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        To constitute a violation of this section, the obstruction must be physical, a result of the body or objects, for ideas or words, even if offensive, abusive, or distasteful, are not enough. State v. Arbeitman, 131 Vt. 596, 313 A.2d 17 (1973).

         3. Elements.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The verb "engage" is defined as "to employ or involve oneself; to take part in; to embark on." Thus, to prove disorderly conduct, the State does not need to prove that the defendant started the fight, but only that he was part of it. State v. Albarelli, 203 Vt. 551, 159 A.3d 627 (Nov. 18, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact finder, in determining whether a defendant's conduct substantially impairs the effective conduct of a meeting, must assess the actual impact of that misconduct on the course of the meeting; naturally, what amounts to a substantial disturbance in one setting may not in another, and the fact finder must take this into account, and may not base its decision on mere assertions of those present that they were "disturbed." The standard is an objective one: the fact finder may not consider the subjective effect of the content of a defendant's expressive conduct on those assembled, but must instead evaluate it in terms of timing, duration or intensity. State v. Colby, 185 Vt. 464, 972 A.2d 197 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial impairment of the effective conduct of a meeting includes conduct that causes a lawful meeting to terminate prematurely. A defendant's conduct amounts to a substantial impairment of a meeting where the defendant makes numerous and sustained efforts to disrupt a meeting after being asked to desist. State v. Colby, 185 Vt. 464, 972 A.2d 197 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Paragraph (3) (disorderly conduct for "abusive language") does not except from its reach those incidents in which the victims are police officers, for the following reasons: (1) the fact that police officers are trained to deal calmly and authoritatively with disorderly persons does not guarantee that police officers are immune from reacting instinctively in the face of an abusive tirade; and (2) a police officer is rightly expected to act in accordance with his or her training or disciplinary rules, but to fashion from this expectation a judicial rule that relieves a person from the reach of a criminal statute solely because the victim is a police officer is to invite the use of abusive language toward police officers. State v. Read, 165 Vt. 141, 680 A.2d 944 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the case of defendant convicted of disorderly conduct state did not fail to prove the elements of the offense since the violent outburst which gave rise to the charge constituted tumultuous behavior and the sheriff's office where the tumultuous behavior occurred was a public place. State v. Lund, 144 Vt. 171, 475 A.2d 1055 (1984), overruled on other grounds, State v. Dumont (1985) 146 Vt. 252, 499 A.2d 787, State v. Begins (1987) 148 Vt. 186, 531 A.2d 595.

         4. Public place.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Under the disorderly conduct statute, it is not necessary that a defendant voluntarily be present in a public place, but rather that a defendant voluntarily engage in violent, tumultuous, or threatening behavior while in a public place; that is to say, it is the defendant's behavior and not her condition that is prohibited. Thus, the fact that defendant was taken to a hospital emergency room involuntarily did not mean that she could not be convicted of disorderly conduct for her behavior there. State v. Amsden, 194 Vt. 128, 75 A.3d 612 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where legally sufficient violent, tumultuous, or threatening behavior in an arguably less public place, such as a sheriff's office or police station, may support a conviction for disorderly conduct, then the same behavior within a hospital must also permit conviction for disorderly conduct. State v. Amsden, 194 Vt. 128, 75 A.3d 612 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant was convicted of disorderly conduct arising out of her actions after she had been stopped by police at an intersection in downtown Burlington, after she was placed in a police cruiser she was still in a public place for purposes of this section. State v. Begins, 147 Vt. 45, 509 A.2d 1007 (1986).

         5. Evidence.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        There was insufficient evidence that defendant, who was charged with disorderly conduct, engaged in fighting or in violent, tumultuous, or threatening behavior by walking directly toward an officer and coming within four feet of him, as such behavior did not show fighting, violent, or tumultuous behavior, and defendant's actions were too ambiguous to indicate a threat. State v. McEachin, 210 Vt. 259, 213 A.3d 1094 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where jury heard testimony that defendant was warned not to obstruct pedestrian traffic, and that he thereafter placed his back against a heavily-used door in order to prevent its use, jury had sufficient grounds for finding the requisite intent to cause public inconvenience or annoyance. State v. Arbeitman, 131 Vt. 596, 313 A.2d 17 (1973).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Since defendant's leaving of Ku Klux Klan flyers at the homes of two women constituted speech and not nonspeech behavior, it did not fall within the disorderly conduct statute. Further, even if the statute could be violated by pure speech, the conduct did not convey an imminent threat of harm, as the flyer was a recruitment solicitation with no explicit statement of threat. State v. Schenk, 207 Vt. 423, 190 A.3d 820 (May 4, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        With regard to defendant's disorderly conduct conviction, testimony that defendant repeatedly punched the complainant's brother fairly and reasonably supported the conclusion that defendant engaged in fighting behavior. State v. Albarelli, 203 Vt. 551, 159 A.3d 627 (Nov. 18, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a probation revocation proceeding, there was no support for the State's position that defendant's "mouthy and obnoxious" conduct toward his landlord could have given rise to a charge of disorderly conduct. State v. Sanville, 189 Vt. 626, 22 A.3d 450 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendants' actions did not substantially impair the effective conduct of a commencement ceremony when a speech was interrupted for less than thirty seconds by defendants' remarks; one defendant was in the process of leaving the ceremony voluntarily when he was apprehended; and both defendants left the site of the ceremony upon being asked and without further incident. Such de minimis disturbances, even if rude and out of place in the context of a commencement ceremony, could not serve as the basis for criminal liability without running afoul of the First Amendment. State v. Colby, 185 Vt. 464, 972 A.2d 197 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where it was shown that defendant directed extremely vulgar and personally offensive insults at the victim and hurled several items around the room in a fit of anger, and that her behavior alarmed other patrons of the food shelf to the point where they felt compelled to leave, the evidence was sufficient to support a finding that an average person, in these circumstances, could have felt provoked to a violent reaction, and was sufficient to convict her, based on a jury verdict, of disorderly conduct. State v. Allcock, 177 Vt. 467, 857 A.2d 287 (mem.) (June 9, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's act of grabbing police officer's flashlight during a pat-down search on a public roadway could create a risk of public annoyance or inconvenience. State v. Cole, 150 Vt. 453, 554 A.2d 253 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's act of grabbing a police officer's flashlight during a pat-down search could be found to be threatening behavior, done to communicate intent to harm. State v. Cole, 150 Vt. 453, 554 A.2d 253 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where trial court found that when defendant was stopped for driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, she yelled and screamed, kicked and resisted arrest and had to be restrained with ankle cuffs, handcuffs, and a seatbelt, and attempted to bite one of the police officers, the conduct justified the court's finding of violent behavior as contemplated by subdiv. (1) of this section. State v. Begins, 147 Vt. 45, 509 A.2d 1007 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant, while passing two people on a sidewalk, struck one of them on the arm, leaving a red mark, defendant's actions were violent within the meaning of subdiv. (1) of this section. State v. O'Connell, 147 Vt. 60, 510 A.2d 167 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was sufficient competent evidence upon each element of crime of engaging in tumultuous and threatening behavior with intent to cause public inconvenience or annoyance to support conviction where defendant, while standing on steps of store, six feet from constable, after being asked by constable to throw beer can away and clear the steps, a request which had come from the store owners, uttered an ethnic slur and with clenched fists threatened the constable, and followed constable into the store and repeated the slur and challenged the constable to step outside behind the store and settle the matter.

        Although 12 V.S.A.
        §
        5602 does protect state employees from suit by providing that under certain circumstances "the exclusive right of action shall lie against the state of Vermont," the statute explicitly does not apply "to gross negligence or willful misconduct." Defendant should have known that his arrest of plaintiff for uttering an expletive to defendant at a roadblock was unlawful. A jury could, therefore, have found that his decision to arrest plaintiff amounted to gross negligence or willful misconduct. Long v. L'Esperance, 166 Vt. 566, 701 A.2d 1048 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        To prevail on his claim of intentional infliction of emotional distress, plaintiff had to demonstrate that defendant police officer's conduct in arresting plaintiff for disorderly conduct was outrageous, that he acted intentionally or with reckless disregard of the probability of causing emotional distress, and that defendant's outrageous conduct was the actual or proximate cause of plaintiff's extreme emotional distress. Accepting plaintiff's evidence as true, defendant's arrest of plaintiff for statement made at roadblock was without legal justification. This was sufficient evidence for the case to go to a jury. Long v. L'Esperance, 166 Vt. 566, 701 A.2d 1048 (1997).

       <p>
        In a prosecution of defendant for disorderly conduct, alleging that defendant "with intent to cause public inconvenience and annoyance, obstructed vehicular traffic," it was error for the trial court to charge the jury to consider whether defendant was "practically certain" that her actions would cause public annoyance or inconvenience. State v. Jackowski, 181 Vt. 73, 915 A.2d 767 (November 22, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution of defendant for disorderly conduct, where the trial judge essentially instructed the jury that it could presume defendant intended to cause public annoyance or inconvenience if it found that defendant knew that such annoyance or inconvenience would occur, the instruction may have led the jury to ignore any evidence of defendant's intent and to convict solely based on her knowledge. Because intent was the only contested issue at trial, the effect of the erroneous instruction was analogous to a directed verdict for the State, and in light of defendant's right to a jury trial, such an error could not be harmless. State v. Jackowski, 181 Vt. 73, 915 A.2d 767 (November 22, 2006).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        With regard to the disorderly conduct statute, violent or threatening behavior means physical force or physical conduct that is immediately likely to produce the use of such force; speech can be introduced to explain or provide context for physical conduct. State v. Schenk, 207 Vt. 423, 190 A.3d 820 (May 4, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Speech can be relevant to explain whether threatening behavior has occurred under the disorderly conduct statute but only where the behavior is physical conduct and not speech. For example, a person using one hand to punch the other hand is more likely to be engaging in threatening behavior if the physical activity is accompanied by threatening statements than if not. State v. Schenk, 207 Vt. 423, 190 A.3d 820 (May 4, 2018).

        Where the alleged threatening activity under the disorderly conduct statute includes speech, a subjective standard that judges whether defendant engaged in threatening behavior based on the reaction of particular persons can interfere with First Amendment protections. Thus, the standard must be objective and turn on how a reasonable person would view defendant's behavior. State v. Albarelli, 189 Vt. 293, 19 A.3d 130 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        State did not present sufficient evidence to sustain a conviction for disorderly conduct based on threatening. Defendant did not target a specific individual when he approached a voter registration table or issue any overt or implied threats, but simply ranted politically, and his conduct lacked any significant physical component. State v. Albarelli, 189 Vt. 293, 19 A.3d 130 (2011).

         11. Public inconvenience or annoyance.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In a disorderly conduct case, there was sufficient evidence that defendant recklessly caused the risk of public inconvenience or annoyance when the events of the night took place in a public place, there was a loud, heated exchange of words between defendant and the complainant's group, at least one member of the public was drawn to the incident, members of both groups tried to separate defendant from the complainant's brother, and defendant pursued the complainant's group after both fights were separated. State v. Albarelli, 203 Vt. 551, 159 A.3d 627 (Nov. 18, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's conduct in a hospital emergency room supported the trial court's conclusion that defendant engaged in criminally tumultuous and violent behavior under the disorderly conduct statute. Defendant had to be "moved along" by police into the hospital; she was loud and disruptive; and after being handcuffed to the bed, she banged it into the wall with such force that it had to be separated from the wall to avoid damage. State v. Amsden, 194 Vt. 128, 75 A.3d 612 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no merit to defendant's argument that she could not be convicted of disorderly conduct for her behavior in an emergency room because such behavior was an expected, natural occurrence in a hospital environment rather than a public annoyance. Defendant's decision to add to the existing atmosphere of an emergency room by voluntarily engaging in a loud, obnoxious, and violent course of conduct without reason or medical excuse would itself create a sufficient risk of additional public inconvenience to sustain her conviction under the statute. State v. Amsden, 194 Vt. 128, 75 A.3d 612 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a disorderly conduct case, the State established that defendant recklessly created a risk of public annoyance. On the basis of officers' testimony that defendant's behavior inside a hospital was largely a continuation of the disruptive and combative conduct in which she had been engaged since her encounter with police began, and her continuing conduct once inside a so-called safe room, the trial court could reasonably infer that defendant was aware of the substantial and unjustifiable risk of public inconvenience or annoyance created by her behavior and thus consciously disregarded it. State v. Amsden, 194 Vt. 128, 75 A.3d 612 (2013).

         12. Abusive language.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        If the "abusive language" provision of the disorderly conduct statute has any continuing force, it is necessarily exceedingly narrow in scope, as the use of foul language and vulgar insults is insufficient, a likelihood of arousing animosity or inflaming anger is insufficient, and the likelihood that the listener will feel an impulse to respond angrily or even forcefully is insufficient. The provision only reaches speech that, in the context in which it is uttered, is so inflammatory that it is akin to dropping a match into a pool of gasoline. State v. Tracy, 200 Vt. 216, 130 A.3d 196 (Aug. 25, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        As the reach of the "abusive language" provision of the disorderly conduct statute was constrained by the contours of the category of "fighting words" as defined by First Amendment jurisprudence, defendant's expression toward his daughter's basketball coach did not fall within the statute. An average person in the coach's position would not reasonably be expected to respond to defendant's harangue with violence when defendant demanded to know why the coach had not allowed the daughter to play, called the coach a "bitch," and used a vulgar four-letter word. State v. Tracy, 200 Vt. 216, 130 A.3d 196 (Aug. 25, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Reach of the "abusive language" provision of the disorderly conduct statute at this point is so narrow that it is unlikely to apply in any but the most extreme circumstances. State v. Tracy, 200 Vt. 216, 130 A.3d 196 (Aug. 25, 2015).

        Since this section, prohibiting a number of acts by use of the telephone, lists the acts in the disjunctive, and defendant was charged strictly in the language of this section so that no specific act was alleged, conviction would be reversed for defendant did not know the nature of the accusation and was unable to prepare a defense, and the evidence and jury charge referred to conduct not stated in the complaint.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Both the plain meaning and the legislative history of the telephone harassment statute indicate that the intent element is measured at the time the telephone call is made, rather than at the time the threat was made. State v. Wilcox, 160 Vt. 271, 628 A.2d 924 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        The intent to make a threatening phone call can be inferred from the actions, conduct or words of the defendant. State v. Wilcox, 160 Vt. 271, 628 A.2d 924 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        The intent to make a threatening phone call does not require a finding that the call was made solely to harass or threaten another. State v. Wilcox, 160 Vt. 271, 628 A.2d 924 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was insufficient evidence for jury to find intent to make a threatening phone call where defendant had legitimate purpose for making call, tenor of call grew increasingly hostile as it continued, and threatening statement was not made until end of call.

         3. Anonymity.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Telephone caller's anonymity depends in part on the listener's nonrecognition of the person engaging in the call, since at the instant of recognition the caller's name or identity, or both, are known. Under any definition, a call cannot be anonymous when its author is known to the listener; it is therefore a necessary condition of anonymity under the statute proscribing disturbing the peace by telephone that the person taking the call does not know the sender. State v. Wyrocki, 191 Vt. 177, 38 A.3d 63 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the victim knew defendant was the caller, even though the caller's phone number registered on the victim's caller ID as "withheld," defendant's calls were not anonymous within the meaning of the statute proscribing disturbing the peace by telephone. The invention of caller ID did not turn what was no violation of the statute in 1967 into a crime today. State v. Wyrocki, 191 Vt. 177, 38 A.3d 63 (2012).

         1. Purpose.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        By enacting this section, legislature intended to provide increased penalties against anyone who assaults a law enforcement officer in the performance of an official duty, knowing or having good reason to believe that the person is in fact such an officer. State v. Peters, 141 Vt. 341, 450 A.2d 332 (1982).

         2. Elements of offense.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Evidence that deputy entered curtilage of defendant's premises in the course of valid investigatory stop supported finding that deputy was assaulted while in performance of his lawful duty. State v. Elkins, 155 Vt. 9, 580 A.2d 1200 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        For purposes of enhanced penalty applicable to simple assault perpetrated on a police officer engaged in the performance of his lawful duty, lawfulness of the officer's duty is to be measured against the scope of his employment and not against the ultimate decision regarding the technical legality under the Fourth Amendment or other law; therefore, the lawfulness of the officer's conduct has relevance to the defenses of provocation and self-defense. State v. Elkins, 155 Vt. 9, 580 A.2d 1200 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        In trial for simple assault on a police officer, evidence that showed defendant was irritated by deputy's presence at defendant's house and use of flashing cruiser lights and deputy's testimony that irate defendant struck him in the eye raised question for jury as to purposefulness of defendant's conduct. State v. Elkins, 155 Vt. 9, 580 A.2d 1200 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        The "lawful duty" standard of this section is intended to prevent police officers from pursuing their own interests or whims under the cloak of official conduct. State v. Collins, 147 Vt. 77, 509 A.2d 1020 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since it was well within the scope of police officer's employment to peaceably remove defendant from a place where his behavior had been objectionable and agree to give him a ride home, assault which took place during the ride occurred while the officer was "performing a lawful duty" within the meaning of this section. State v. Collins, 147 Vt. 77, 509 A.2d 1020 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was properly found guilty of assaulting a police officer performing a lawful duty, even though the officer had taped defendant's conversation with his attorney, allegedly in violation of federal law, since the officer was not taping at the time of the assault, but was lawfully assisting other police officers. State v. Fuller, 146 Vt. 364, 503 A.2d 550 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the victim of defendant's assault was a deputy sheriff whose certificate of appointment to that office stated that he had attended a 36-hour course in police instruction, defendant could be found guilty under this section, rendering the offense of simple assault a more serious crime carrying greater penalties when committed upon a law enforcement officer performing a lawful duty, since, even though the officer's certificate did not state that he had completed the training course as required by section 311 of Title 24, governing appointment of deputy sheriffs, he was a de facto officer and, therefore, was a law enforcement officer within the meaning of this section, and a party to the action. State v. Mitchell, 142 Vt. 517, 458 A.2d 1089 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant was charged with aggravated assault on a police officer with a deadly weapon, the state had the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant either attempted to cause, or purposely or knowingly caused, bodily injury, through the use of a deadly weapon, to a law enforcement officer engaged in the performance of a lawful duty. State v. Lupien, 143 Vt. 378, 466 A.2d 1172 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the case of defendant convicted of breaking and entering in the nighttime with intent to commit larceny, where the uncontradicted facts established at trial proved that defendant assisted in the break-in, entered the building with two others and was in the process of pointing out to them where the food they intended to steal was when the police arrived, it was not error for the trial court to deny defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal, notwithstanding the fact that the court stated in its findings of fact that defendant was a "tagalong," since the findings made clear that defendant knowingly and intentionally participated in the crime. State v. Wood, 143 Vt. 408, 465 A.2d 1372 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section requires that the simple assault of an officer occur while the officer is performing a lawful duty. State v. Desjardins, 142 Vt. 255, 454 A.2d 1230 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, the lawfulness of the officer's duty is to be measured against the scope of his employment and not against the ultimate decision regarding the technical legality of the activities in question. State v. Desjardins, 142 Vt. 255, 454 A.2d 1230 (1982).

        Intoxication is available as a defense to negate the element of knowledge under this section. State v. Galvin, 147 Vt. 215, 514 A.2d 705 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution for assault of a police officer involving provocative conduct by the police, the jury, having been correctly charged on self-defense, was free to decide that the defendant's actions were not reasonable under the circumstances. State v. Desjardins, 142 Vt. 255, 454 A.2d 1230 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Husband who was prevented by restraining order from being at the home of his estranged wife was not protecting himself from forcible removal from his property when police forcibly removed him from wife's home, he resisted, and blows were struck; and he was properly convicted of unlawful trespass and of recklessly causing bodily injury to a law enforcement officer performing a lawful duty. State v. Foster, 139 Vt. 18, 421 A.2d 1284 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where state policeman arrived after defendant and constable who called policeman had verbal dispute, policeman caught up with defendant, who was rapidly walking away from store, policeman asked defendant to accompany him, defendant refused and walked away, officer placed hand on defendant's shoulder, defendant continued to walk and his shirt ripped and he grabbed, shook and pushed officer, and as the two grappled the constable seized defendant from behind, jury could reject claim of self-defense and find defendant guilty of assaulting a police officer performing his duty. State v. Pickett, 137 Vt. 336, 403 A.2d 272 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant, tried for assault upon law enforcement officer who had attempted to serve process on defendant in his home, testified that as he walked down hall in his home someone jumped out at him and shoved something toward his face and he put his hands up to block the object and in doing so struck the officer, there was sufficient evidence to necessitate a charge on self-defense, and it was reversible error to refuse to give one. State v. Bartlett, 136 Vt. 142, 385 A.2d 1109 (1978).

         4. Instructions.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        As a whole, the instructions on aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and attempted simple assault by physical menace breathed the true spirit and doctrine of the law. The instructions, while referring to defendant's "secret intent," also provided detail about the intent elements for both offenses; even though the trial court did not use the words "specific intent," the instructions adequately explained the required subjective moral culpability by stating that the jury was required to find defendant actually intended to threaten police officers. State v. Dow, 202 Vt. 616, 152 A.3d 437 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where jury charge tracked statutory elements of simple assault and simple assault against police officer and added "private citizen may not use force to resist arrest by one he knows, or has good reason to believe, is an authorized police officer engaged in the performance of his duties," defendant did not object to charge, self-defense charge raised issue of knowledge that victim was police officer and evidence was strong that defendant knew that victim was police officer, omission of element of knowledge from charge did not warrant reversal. State v. Roy, 151 Vt. 17, 557 A.2d 884 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the case of defendant charged with simple assault on a police officer, trial court's failure to adequately define the element of lawful duty in its jury instructions was not prejudicial to the defendant where the officer had identified himself, his official capacity was admittedly known to the defendant, and the officer had informed the defendant that he was being arrested pursuant to a bench warrant; therefore, as a matter of law the police officer was acting within the scope of his lawful duty. State v. Peters, 141 Vt. 341, 450 A.2d 332 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        On review of a conviction of simple assault against a police officer, the supreme court could not conclude that the trial court's instructions distinguishing between the enhanced crime of assault of a police officer and simple assault under section 1023 of this title so prejudiced the defendant as to deprive him of a right to a fair trial and mandate reversal, where the jury returned a verdict of not guilty on all counts of assault against one of the two officers and a not guilty verdict on the charge of assault and a guilty verdict only on the charge of simple assault against the other officer. State v. Desjardins, 142 Vt. 255, 454 A.2d 1230 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution for assault of a police officer, the trial court's instructions, when viewed as a whole, properly instructed the jury on the enhanced crime of assault of a police officer and the crime of simple assault where the court carefully and clearly explained each element of assault of a police officer and correctly distinguished the lesser included offense of simple assault, repeatedly emphasized the need to weigh all the circumstances, both to determine the lawfulness of the police conduct and to determine the reasonableness of the defendant's response, and instructed that section 1023 of this title, governing simple assault, has nothing to do with the status of the individual as a police officer and is without regard to whether the individual was acting in the performance of a lawful duty; the instruction that none of the acts of search and seizure were in themselves unlawful did not remove an essential element of the crime from the jury's consideration where the instructions also clearly were that, if the jury found that "the officer himself committed an assault, or used excessive force in dealing with the defendant prior to striking, then he was not performing a lawful duty and you [the jury] must find the defendant not guilty." State v. Desjardins, 142 Vt. 255, 454 A.2d 1230 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution for assault of a police officer involving provocative conduct by the police, reversal of conviction on the basis of the instructions to the jury was not warranted where the trial judge's characterization of the police as being engaged in acts "not in themselves unlawful" was clearly tied to an explanation of this section and the meaning of lawful duty, and there was no indication that the jury failed to appreciate the distinction between the need to find that the officers were performing their lawful duty before enhanced penalties became operative and the finding that an unlawful search could aggravate a confrontation and lend credence to a claim of self-defense. State v. Desjardins, 142 Vt. 255, 454 A.2d 1230 (1982).

       </h5>
       <p>
        There was sufficient evidence that defendant had the specific intent required to prove aggravated assault with a deadly weapon and attempted simple assault by physical menace. While some facts could support a finding that defendant harbored an intent to harm himself at certain times during the incident, the circumstantial evidence, particularly the fact that defendant was angrily running down the hall toward the officers carrying a knife, was sufficient for the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant acted with the specific intent to threaten the officers. State v. Dow, 202 Vt. 616, 152 A.3d 437 (2016).

        </b>
        .
       </h5>
       <p>
        Despite defendant's illiteracy, statutory language required State to prove only that defendant violated abuse prevention order after it was properly served upon him, and State was not required to prove that defendant knew that his conduct would violate order or that he fully understood requirements of order. State v. Crown, 169 Vt. 547, 726 A.2d 493 (mem.) (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court correctly charged on the mens rea element of the crime of violation of an abuse prevention order. Defendant had the responsibility to read and understand the order and to conform his conduct to it. State v. Mott, 166 Vt. 188, 692 A.2d 360 (1997).

         2. Validity of order.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Defendant should have been acquitted of violating an abuse-prevention order issued in New Hampshire because in the absence of evidence that the final order had been served on defendant by proof of mailing it to his last known address in accordance with New Hampshire law, which had not adopted actual notice as a substitute for service of process in abuse cases, the State had not established that the final order was enforceable in Vermont pursuant to the statute governing enforceability of foreign orders. State v. O'Keefe, 209 Vt. 497, 208 A.3d 249 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not make the validity of an abuse prevention order an element of the offense of violating it; the validity of the order is a legal issue for resolution by the trial court and not by the jury. State v. Mott, 166 Vt. 188, 692 A.2d 360 (1997).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Service of order on defendant was sufficient to meet requirements of due process, even though he was unable to read terms of order, since service should have put defendant on notice that he needed to know terms of order and comply with them. State v. Crown, 169 Vt. 547, 726 A.2d 493 (mem.) (1999).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Jury had to find the predicate conviction beyond a reasonable doubt in order for the court to impose the greater sentence authorized by subsec. (b) of this section. State v. Dunbar, 172 Vt. 557, 772 A.2d 533 (mem.) (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant pled not guilty to the state's information charging a violation of this section, and was not asked to plead specially on the enhancement question, his silence on that issue must be taken as a denial, not a waiver. State v. Dunbar, 172 Vt. 557, 772 A.2d 533 (mem.) (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the state failed to prove defendant's predicate conviction before the jury was discharged, recall of the jury to make such determination was error, and he could be convicted only of the first offense misdemeanor specified in subsec. (a) of this section. State v. Dunbar, 172 Vt. 557, 772 A.2d 533 (mem.) (2001).

        </b>
        .
       </h5>
       <p>
        In the absence of any elaboration, the appropriate definition of "harassment" in a relief-from-abuse order is that used in the stalking statute, which contains an element of threat. Thus, an instruction that allowed a conviction for violating a relief-from-abuse order on the basis of objectively annoying conduct was clearly error; moreover, defendant was significantly prejudiced by the instruction, as the State's case, and the conviction, rested squarely on the overly broad definition of harassment used in the instruction. State v. Waters, 195 Vt. 233, 87 A.3d 512 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution of defendant for violating an abuse prevention order, an instruction that the jury could find that he had violated the order if it found that he had "followed or stalked" the victim was not plain error since the instruction defined the terms "following" and "stalk" in much the same way as those terms are defined in the stalking statute and the evidence relating to alternative theories under which a jury could convict was intertwined throughout the trial. State v. Prior, 181 Vt. 564, 917 A.2d 466 (mem.) (January 5, 2007).

       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution of defendant for violating an abuse prevention order that prohibited him from stalking, following, or coming within 100 feet of his ex-girlfriend, the trial court did not err in instructing the jury that the legal definition of "following" included placing oneself in physical proximity of another. State v. Malshuk, 177 Vt. 475, 857 A.2d 282 (mem.) (June 9, 2004).

       <p>
        Evidence that the vehicle in which defendant was a passenger remained in proximity to his ex-girlfriend's vehicle for several miles, and that defendant threw a beer bottle out the window toward her was sufficient for a reasonable jury to conclude that his conduct constituted following. State v. Malshuk, 177 Vt. 475, 857 A.2d 282 (mem.) (June 9, 2004).

       <p>
        Convictions of defendant for attempted felony violation of a relief from abuse order by following or stalking the victim, and contempt for violating his condition of release by coming within 100 feet of the victim or her vehicle, did not violate double jeopardy. State v. Prior, 181 Vt. 564, 917 A.2d 466 (mem.) (January 5, 2007).

        There was no error in sentencing defendant, who was convicted of violating an abuse-prevention order and of five misdemeanors, to five to fourteen years under the Habitual Offender Act. Defendant's sentence was neither contrary to his plea agreement, nor inconsistent with the minimum authorized by statutes other than the Act, nor beyond the enhanced maximum allowed by the Act.

        In an aggravated domestic assault case, the trial court properly admitted evidence of defendant's prior assaults against the complainant to show the nature of the parties' relationship and explain what might otherwise appear to be incongruous behavior to a jury, such as remaining with an abusive partner and delaying a report of abuse. The evidence was also relevant to address issues of motive and claims of fabrication. State v. Williams, 188 Vt. 405, 9 A.3d 315 (Aug. 20, 2010).

        In an aggravated domestic assault case, there was no merit to defendant's claim that the probative value of evidence of his prior assaults against the complainant was substantially outweighed by the danger of unfair prejudice. The evidence was highly probative under the circumstances to explain the dynamic of the parties' relationship and the complainant's conduct both before and after the assault; the evidence did not raise the specter of unfair prejudice that could have resulted from testimony regarding other victims of abuse; and the trial court gave a limiting instruction.

        Trial court properly denied defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal of domestic assault. During a 911 recording, the complainant identified defendant and stated that she was beaten with his fists; the evidence contained in the 911 recording was supported by the responding officers' testimony and the photographs depicting the complainant's injuries; the evidence was sufficient to establish that by striking the complainant, defendant consciously disregarded a substantial and unjustifiable risk of bodily injury; and the evidence admitted could reasonably convince a jury that the cut above the complainant's eye was a "bodily injury" and that the complainant was a household member.

        The trial court did not commit prejudicial error by refusing to instruct the jury that defendant's testimony from a relief-from-abuse proceeding concerning the incident could be considered as substantive evidence. State v. Harrington, 174 Vt. 584, 816 A.2d 501 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence showing that the victim, defendant's estranged wife, was working on the roof of a small wooden shed and that defendant drove his truck into the shed at 20-30 miles an hour was sufficient to establish the element of attempt and to support defendant's conviction for domestic assault.

        Given the danger of unfair prejudice and the limited relevance of the evidence, bifurcation of a substantive domestic assault offense from an enhancement for violating a condition-of-release order was warranted. The facts supporting the no-harassment court-ordered condition, issued a year before the charged offense, held little probative value or factual connection to the incident that formed the basis of the domestic assault charge presented to the jury; admission of the condition-of-release order was highly prejudicial in that it established for the jury that a court had found it necessary to issue a protective order on behalf of the putative victim against defendant; and given the strong prejudicial nature of the condition-of-release order, the multiple references to it at trial, the noncumulative nature of the evidence, and the fact that the case ultimately came down to a credibility determination between defendant and his ex-girlfriend, the inclusion of the evidence was not harmless.

        The facts known to the officer at the time defendant's arrest was made were sufficient, for purposes of the felony escape statute, to support an arrest for the commission of a felony, despite the officer's erroneous labelling of the charges as misdemeanors.
    The facts set forth in the charging affidavit were obtained from a sworn statement of defendant's girlfriend, who stated
    that defendant placed a loaded pistol to her head and threatened to shoot her.
    This fact, in conjunction with other information, provided sufficient probable cause to support an arrest for aggravated domestic assault under 13 V.S.A.
        §
        1043(a)(2), a felony. State v. Powell, 167 Vt. 294, 707 A.2d 272 (mem.) (1997).

        Defendant's assault on his wife in direct violation of a temporary relief from abuse order, several earlier incidents of physical assault and harassment, and restraining her against her will and threatening her life with a loaded handgun supported felony charges of aggravated domestic assault and first degree unlawful restraint and also revocation of bail.

        There was sufficient evidence that defendant meant to threaten the six-year-old victim when the evidence showed that the victim was bothering defendant while he worked and that he took the box cutter, held it close to her stomach, and said something to the effect that he was going to kill her that night while she was asleep. State v. Kuzawski, 206 Vt. 351, 181 A.3d 62 (Dec. 15, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Acquittal of a charge against defendant of aggravated assault was properly denied because it was supported by a past recollection recorded statement by the claimant, as well as a 911 telephone call, observations by the responding officer, and photographs of the complainant's injuries.

        In a prosecution for aggravated domestic assault, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal on the basis that there was insufficient evidence that the knife used in the assault was a deadly weapon, even though the knife itself was not entered in evidence, and the State instead relied entirely on the victim's testimony to prove this element of the crime.

       <p>
        Firearm employed in a threat against a family or household member need not be shown to be operable or loaded to constitute a deadly weapon; in the context of first-degree aggravated domestic assault, it is entirely irrelevant if a rifle brandished to punctuate a threat was loaded and able to fire when the threat was made, because this crime does not require an imminent threat. Consequently, a firearm did not have to be proven to be loaded and operable, immediately or otherwise, to constitute a deadly weapon in a prosecution for first-degree aggravated domestic assault, and the trial court did not err by omitting such a requirement in its instructions to the jury.

        Trial court's instruction on first-degree aggravated assault tracked the language of the statute and contained definitions for both recklessness and willfulness, gave the jury the diminished capacity instruction requested by defendant, and explicitly instructed the jurors to consider whether defendant's intoxication negated his ability to form willful intent. Further, because the instructions were clear that the jury was only to consider diminished capacity with willful intent and because there was nothing restricting recklessness to be considered in the alternative, the jury was necessarily unanimous on the intent element.

        Because an object can be found to be a deadly weapon if it is objectively capable of causing harm, the box cutter here, which defendant was using to cut boxes and which thus could be understood to have sharp edges and to be capable of producing death or serious injury despite its unusual design, was a deadly weapon for purposes of conviction under the domestic assault statute. State v. Kuzawski, 206 Vt. 351, 181 A.3d 62 (Dec. 15, 2017).

        In a post-conviction relief proceeding, defendant, by his plea of guilty, waived the argument that the trial court should not have convicted him of second degree aggravated domestic assault because he did not have a prior conviction for domestic assault; however, because he should not have been convicted of violating subdiv. (a)(2) of this section, the case was remanded for further proceedings on his claim that he received ineffective assistance of counsel. In re Andres, 177 Vt. 511, 857 A.2d 803 (mem.) (August 6, 2004); In re Torres, 177 Vt. 507, 861 A.2d 1055 (mem.) (August 6, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's decision that a single act which violated both subdivisions (a)(1) and (a)(2) of this section could be punished as separate crimes violated defendant's right against double jeopardy; legislature did not intend to authorize separate sentences when domestic assault occurs under two separate aggravating circumstances.

       <p>
        In a prosecution for second-degree aggravated domestic assault, where defendant assaulted complainant a short time after she had moved out of the apartment she shared with him for six months prior to the assault, because, under 15 V.S.A.
        §
        1101(2), two persons are "household members" if they either lived together or had a sexual relationship at any time prior to the assault, such evidence showed that complainant and defendant satisfied both of these alternative requirements; thus, the question of whether defendant and complainant were household members was not something that a rational jury could reasonably doubt and, accordingly, defendant was not entitled to an instruction on the lesser included offense of simple assault. State v. Swift, 176 Vt. 299, 844 A.2d 802 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for second-degree aggravated domestic assault, judge's instruction to the effect that the law does not recognize the fact of remaining in or returning to an apparently abusive relationship as evidence to question the witness' credibility was not fair to defendant because the State had not presented any evidence on battered women's syndrome to support the theory that the instruction articulated, and, even if the State had presented such evidence, the instruction was incorrect on the law regarding the proper role of the jury in such cases. State v. Swift, 176 Vt. 299, 844 A.2d 802 (2004).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Given the danger of unfair prejudice and the limited relevance of the evidence, bifurcation of a substantive domestic assault offense from an enhancement for violating a condition-of-release order was warranted. The facts supporting the no-harassment court-ordered condition, issued a year before the charged offense, held little probative value or factual connection to the incident that formed the basis of the domestic assault charge presented to the jury; admission of the condition-of-release order was highly prejudicial in that it established for the jury that a court had found it necessary to issue a protective order on behalf of the putative victim against defendant; and given the strong prejudicial nature of the condition-of-release order, the multiple references to it at trial, the noncumulative nature of the evidence, and the fact that the case ultimately came down to a credibility determination between defendant and his ex-girlfriend, the inclusion of the evidence was not harmless. State v. Brillon, 187 Vt. 444, 995 A.2d 557 (2010).

       </h5>
       <p>
        There is no basis in the stalking statute to require that the perpetrator's act and the victim's fear be contemporaneous. Thus, because the victim stated that she was fearful after learning that petitioner had been caught peeping through her bedroom window, it was error to vacate his aggravated stalking conviction. In re Hoch, 194 Vt. 575, 82 A.3d 1167 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a stalking case, there was no merit to defendant's argument that the complainant's testimony at trial regarding her fear of defendant was not credible because it contradicted her statements to the police and her testimony at the motion to dismiss hearing. Through cross-examination, defendant demonstrated the alleged inconsistencies in the complainant's reports to the police, her testimony at the pretrial hearing, and her testimony at trial; it was up to the jury to decide whether the complainant's testimony regarding her fear of defendant was credible. State v. Hinchliffe, 186 Vt. 487, 987 A.2d 988 (Nov. 6, 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution of defendant for violating an abuse prevention order, an instruction that the jury could find that he had violated the order if it found that he had "followed or stalked" the victim was not plain error since the instruction defined the terms "following" and "stalk" in much the same way as those terms are defined in the stalking statute and the evidence relating to alternative theories under which a jury could convict was intertwined throughout the trial. State v. Prior, 181 Vt. 564, 917 A.2d 466 (mem.) (January 5, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant failed in his argument that a post-conviction amendment to Vermont's stalking statute mandated that he receive a new trial because, aside from defendant's mere assertion that clarifying amendments are procedural per se, this suggested exception to the statutory provision on the retroactive effect of statutory amendments is unsupported by statutes or case law and the court declined to adopt it. State v. Van Aelstyn, 181 Vt. 274, 917 A.2d 471 (January 12, 2007), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 68, 2007 U.S. LEXIS 10280, 169 L. Ed. 2d 17 (U.S. 2007).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Stalking statute employs an objective standard by defining harassing behavior as conduct which would cause a reasonable person to fear bodily injury. Although the statute requires the jury to view a defendant's conduct from the perspective of a reasonable person, the victim's knowledge of the defendant is relevant to the question of whether the defendant's actions would have caused a reasonable person to fear bodily injury; other states that have an objective standard in their stalking statute agree that this inquiry is measured by examining whether a reasonable person in the victim's circumstances would be afraid. State v. Hinchliffe, 186 Vt. 487, 987 A.2d 988 (Nov. 6, 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Courts in stalking cases have admitted evidence of a defendant's prior relationship with and conduct towards a victim to show that a victim's fear is reasonable. In addition, a victim's knowledge of a defendant's conduct towards a third party may be relevant to whether it is reasonable for the victim to fear the defendant. State v. Hinchliffe, 186 Vt. 487, 987 A.2d 988 (Nov. 6, 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        As defined by the Legislature, the elements of the crime of stalking do not require that the defendant have threatened violent behavior or unlawful restraint in the past, or that the victim feared for her safety or that she would be restrained. Threats are commonly present in stalking situations, and aid the State's case if present, but their absence is not fatal to a stalking prosecution; similarly, the victim's fear may be helpful to the State, if present, but the critical element of the crime is defined solely in objective terms - whether a "reasonable person" would fear "unlawful restraint" - and the absence of the victim's fear is not determinative. State v. Ellis, 186 Vt. 232, 979 A.2d 1023 (2009).

       <p>
        In the absence of any elaboration, the appropriate definition of "harassment" in a relief-from-abuse order is that used in the stalking statute, which contains an element of threat. Thus, an instruction that allowed a conviction for violating a relief-from-abuse order on the basis of objectively annoying conduct was clearly error; moreover, defendant was significantly prejudiced by the instruction, as the State's case, and the conviction, rested squarely on the overly broad definition of harassment used in the instruction. State v. Waters, 195 Vt. 233, 87 A.3d 512 (2013).

        Obsessive behavior, without threats or attempted acts of violence, could cause a reasonable person to fear unlawful restraint, but here, defendant's actions did not rise to a level that would cause a reasonable person to have such fear, requiring the reversal of his stalking conviction. Almost all the interaction between defendant and the victim, who were high school students, occurred at school in public areas or at school-related public activities; there was no evidence that defendant tried to get the victim alone in a private setting; the victim did not testify that she feared unlawful restraint or bodily injury from defendant; the period in which defendant was on clear notice that his contact was unwanted was very short in relation to the cases where stalking had been found; there was almost no attempt to enlist the assistance of third parties; and defendant's behavior was often more awkward than deliberate.

       <p>
        2015 version of the criminal stalking statute was facially constitutional. "True threats" are not constitutionally protected, and the expression potentially targeted by the statute's definition of "harassing" consisted primarily, if not completely, of true threats; moreover, the statute's application to only those threats that reasonably cause substantial emotional distress did not offend the First Amendment. State v. Noll, 208 Vt. 474, 199 A.3d 1054 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        2015 version of the criminal stalking statute did not violate the First Amendment as applied to defendant. A trier of fact could find that, in the context of defendant's overall course of conduct as well as the specific context of the book he disseminated near the complainant's workplace, the statement in the book "Shoot the terrorist? Or shoot the 'artist?' Neither are present" would cause a reasonable person to fear unlawful violence. State v. Noll, 208 Vt. 474, 199 A.3d 1054 (2018).

       <p>
        Jury instruction for defendant's criminal stalking charge was improper because in spite of defendant's objection, the instruction explained that the jury could convict if it determined that defendant engaged in a course of conduct requiring at least two acts that met the elements of the statute. It did not instruct that at least one of the two acts that constituted part of the course of conduct needed to occur within the applicable limitations period, which allowed the jury to convict based entirely on two acts that occurred outside the limitations period. State v. Noll, 208 Vt. 474, 199 A.3d 1054 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Chargeable course of conduct under the 2015 criminal stalking statute could include acts outside the limitations period, as long as at least one act that met the elements of the criminal stalking statute occurred within three years prior to the date the defendant was charged. State v. Noll, 208 Vt. 474, 199 A.3d 1054 (2018).

       <p>
        Bribery is the receiving or offering any undue reward, by or to any person whomsoever, whose ordinary business or profession relates to the administration of public justice, in order to influence his behavior in office, and to incline him to act contrary to his duty and the known rules of honesty and integrity.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Proof that one assumed control of money passed over into his possession as a gift by another, and that one to whom it was so passed over understood at time that he accepted it, and that money had thereby passed from control of such other person into his control, showed an acceptance of the money. State v. Smith, 72 Vt. 366, 48 A. 647 (1900).

         1. Breaking.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        "Breaking," which is an essential element of the crime of breaking and entering in the nighttime, implies the use of force, no matter how slight. State v. Cline, 139 Vt. 451, 430 A.2d 455 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Entering through an already open window is not sufficient to constitute a breaking. State v. Cline, 139 Vt. 451, 430 A.2d 455 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where evidence showed that defendant entered building through window but did not establish whether he had to open window to enter, the state's evidence did not establish the prima facie case necessary for finding defendant broke into building within meaning of statute relating to offense of breaking and entering in nighttime. State v. Cline, 139 Vt. 451, 430 A.2d 455 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Word "break" as used in this section implied use of force. State v. Hart, 119 Vt. 54, 117 A.2d 387 (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was no evidence fairly and reasonably tending to establish element of "breaking" as alleged, respondent's motion for a directed verdict should be granted. State v. Hart, 119 Vt. 54, 117 A.2d 387 (1955).

         2. Intent
        </b>
        .
       </h5>
       <p>
        There was sufficient evidence that defendant, who was convicted of burglary, had the specific intent to commit larceny. There was evidence that defendant forcibly entered an antique shop's building and rifled through drawers, cupboards, and dressers, although nothing was missing from the shop; furthermore, although defendant presented evidence of his intoxication, it was up to the jury to weigh this evidence and determine whether he had the requisite intent. State v. Langdell, 187 Vt. 576, 989 A.2d 556 (mem.) (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence showing that: defendant told the police that he went to the restaurant to get some money because he was in debt; he broke a rear window to gain entry; he damaged a safe, nearly breaking off the safe's handle, was sufficient to convince a reasonable juror beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant entered the restaurant intending to steal. State v. Ingerson, 176 Vt. 428, 852 A.2d 567 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Intent to commit a larceny at the time of entry, like other elements of the crime, must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Savo, 139 Vt. 644, 433 A.2d 292 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Term "or other felony" is not a limitation on what precedes, but is inserted to extend scope of section to other offenses not specifically named therein. State v. Demag, 118 Vt. 273, 108 A.2d 390 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        Breaking and entry constituted burglary if done with intent to commit larceny, regardless of whether larceny done or intended was petit larceny or grand larceny, although petit larceny was not a statutory felony. State v. Hodgdon, 89 Vt. 148, 94 A. 301 (1915), same case 89 Vt. 510, 96 A. 4; State v. Keyser, 56 Vt. 622 (1884).
       </p>
       <p>
        Burglariously entering a dwelling house, with intent to commit adultery, did not constitute an offense within this section. State v. Cooper, 16 Vt. 551 (1844).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Under this section and
        §
        1202 of this title, it was as much burglary to break and enter in daytime as it was to break and enter in nighttime; the effect of the statute being, not to make two crimes, but to make two grades of same crime. State v. Newell, 93 Vt. 81, 106 A. 561 (1919).
       </p>
       <p>
        While it was necessary to allege the aggravating circumstances to convict of higher grade of burglary, it was not necessary to allege that offense was committed in daytime to convict of lower grade. State v. Newell, 93 Vt. 81, 106 A. 561 (1919).

         5. Lesser included offenses.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Although elements of entry and knowledge were common to both burglary and criminal trespass statutes, burglary did not require entry into a "dwelling house" and trespass did not require intent to commit a felony or other crime, and therefore trespass was not a lesser included offense of burglary. State v. Crawford, 169 Vt. 371, 737 A.2d 366 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a nonresidence is involved, the unlawful trespass statute requires that the normal access to the building be locked, or that certain methods of notice against trespass be employed, and the additional element of proof results in unlawful trespass not being a lesser included offense of burglary. State v. Savo, 139 Vt. 644, 433 A.2d 292 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where unlawful trespass was held not to be a lesser included offense of burglary,
        State v. Nicasio,
        136 Vt. 162, 385 A.2d 1096 (1978), was overruled insofar as it intimated that unlawful entry of a locked nonresidence was a lesser included offense of burglary in the nighttime. State v. Savo, 139 Vt. 644, 433 A.2d 292 (1981).

         6. Allegation.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The allegation of the ultimate felony intended with respect to a prosecution for breaking and entering with intent to commit a felony need not be set out as fully and specifically as would be required in an indictment for the actual commission of that felony. State v. Barr, 126 Vt. 112, 223 A.2d 462 (1966).

       <p>
        In burglary prosecution initially charging entering with intent to commit larceny and unlawful mischief, mid-trial amendment to information deleting allegation of intent to steal alcohol and to damage building was permissible since portion removed was an unnecessary allegation, as state was not required to specify what defendant intended to steal. State v. Verge, 152 Vt. 93, 564 A.2d 1353 (1989).

         8. Evidence.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        There was sufficient evidence to support the burglary conviction. The evidence, including a project manager's testimony that roofing material was stored inside the unfinished house and that it was unlikely that an employee moved the material, as well as eyewitness testimony that defendant moved the material from a location by the house to a portable toilet before his cousin pulled in to load the materials, supported a finding that defendant had actually entered the structure to remove the materials; furthermore, the unfinished house could constitute an enclosure despite the absence of a roof, windows, and doors. State v. Lampman, 206 Vt. 323, 181 A.3d 54 (Dec. 8, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the case of defendant convicted of burglary, where a person whose general description corresponded with that of defendant was in the burglarized building only a few minutes after an alarm signaled that an entry had been made, when that person emerged from the building, he fled into a wooded area near the building, after being ordered to stop by the investigating officer, defendant was discovered lying face down in the woods, partially concealed by leaves and wearing the same clothing worn by the person who had been seen fleeing the building, a lighted flashlight was found close by, and a sneaker print, corresponding to the sole of sneakers worn by defendant was discovered near the building, the evidence, although entirely circumstantial, was sufficiently cogent and persuasive to lift its effect above mere suspicion. State v. Partlow, 143 Vt. 33, 460 A.2d 454 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence justified jury's finding that defendant was not only present at scene of burglary, with knowledge of companion's criminal objective, but was guilty of participation in its accomplishment by acting as lookout rather than abandoning project as he could have without consequences. State v. Nicasio, 136 Vt. 162, 385 A.2d 1096 (1978), overruled on other grounds, State v. Savo (1981) 139 Vt. 644, 433 A.2d 292.
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant was charged with burglary in the nighttime and the state offered no evidence of the nighttime element of the offense, it was error to deny motion for verdict of acquittal on the ground that the evidence was insufficient to sustain a conviction of the offense charged. State v. Boutin, 134 Vt. 151, 352 A.2d 689 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Suspicion that accused participated in burglary, however strong, will not take place of evidence supporting accused's participation in burglary. State v. Mecier, 126 Vt. 260, 227 A.2d 298 (1967).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence which only showed that defendant took alleged accomplices to the scene of crime and later picked them up near the scene, and which failed to show that defendant encouraged or incited the burglary or that there was a preconceived plan in which defendant joined to commit the burglary was not sufficient to sustain defendant's conviction as principal in burglary. State v. Mecier, 126 Vt. 260, 227 A.2d 298 (1967).

         9. Instructions.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Jury instruction that defines "building or structure" to include enclosures that lack a roof is consistent with the plain language of the burglary statute. State v. Lampman, 206 Vt. 323, 181 A.3d 54 (Dec. 8, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        In instructing the jury that "a building or structure can exist without a roof and without being closed in" the trial court did not relieve the State of its burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the construction project was a "building or structure"; rather, its instructions framed the legal definition of "building or structure" to guide the jury's assessment of whether this element was satisfied, but left the question whether defendant had entered a "building or structure" to the jury. State v. Lampman, 206 Vt. 323, 181 A.3d 54 (Dec. 8, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Inclusion of "an instruction within an instruction" in a burglary charge is actually a wise practice. Why this is the "better practice" is clear: to determine whether a defendant had the requisite intent to commit a crime, a juror would have to know the elements of that crime; without being aware of the elements of the intended crime, a juror might mistakenly convict a defendant on faulty assumptions about what is criminal and what is not. State v. Langdell, 187 Vt. 576, 989 A.2d 556 (mem.) (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jury instruction regarding the specific intent element of the burglary charge was not so misleading as to amount to plain error. Because the inclusion of "an instruction within an instruction" in a burglary charge was actually a wise practice, inclusion of the elements of larceny did not amount to plain error, and because the rest of the instruction adequately described every other element of both burglary and larceny, it was hard to believe that a juror would have been confused into thinking that throwing a rock through a door was an element of larceny. State v. Langdell, 187 Vt. 576, 989 A.2d 556 (mem.) (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where at defendant's trial for aiding in the crime of breaking and entering a dwelling house with intent to commit larceny trial court instructed the jury that "under the law a person is presumed to intend the natural and probable consequences of his acts," the instruction violated defendant's right to due process of law, since it could reasonably be interpreted as requiring a conclusive presumption on the element of intent which shifted the burden of proof on that element to defendant and the court could not discount the possibility that the jurors actually proceeded upon it rather than upon additional instructions which the state claimed corrected the erroneous charge. State v. Martell, 143 Vt. 275, 465 A.2d 1346 (1983), overruled on other grounds by State v. Myers, 190 Vt. 29, 26 A.3d 9 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where unlawful trespass was held not to be a lesser included offense of burglary, the trial court erred in giving the lesser included offense instruction. State v. Savo, 139 Vt. 644, 433 A.2d 292 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant was charged with burglary in the nighttime and there was no evidence of the nighttime element of the offense, the court, absent a grant of motion for acquittal, which would have been proper, should have placed before the jury only the question of whether there was a burglary in the daytime, and instructions that if the jury could not find defendant guilty of burglary in the nighttime it could find him guilty of burglary in the daytime, without any definition of nighttime and daytime, was error, and reversal was required. State v. Boutin, 134 Vt. 151, 352 A.2d 689 (1976).

       <p>
        Defendant's prior burglary convictions were violent crimes for purposes of federal career offender provision, regardless of fact that burglaries involved "seasonal dwellings" or "summer camps" as opposed to permanent residences. United States v. Fredette, 15 F.3d 272 (2d Cir.), cert. denied, 511 U.S. 1114, 114 S. Ct. 2119, 128 L. Ed. 2d 677 (1994), 511 U.S. 1149, 114 S. Ct. 2180, 128 L. Ed. 2d 899 (1994).

         11. Particular cases.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Defendant's restraint of the victims after he entered their home created a danger independent of the risk posed by burglars entering an occupied home intent on theft. Thus, the burglary was a separate offense from kidnapping, and the motion to dismiss the kidnapping charge was properly denied. State v. Jones, 190 Vt. 586, 44 A.3d 148 (2011).
       </p>

        For purposes of enhanced penalty applicable to career criminals under 18 U.S.C.
        §
        924(e)(1), prior conviction of this section constitutes a "violent felony." United States v. Mitchell, 745 F. Supp. 201 (D. Vt. 1990), aff'd, 932 F.2d 1027 (2d Cir. 1991).

         1. Complaint.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        It was essential that complaint allege that abandonment was wilful and that it was done in a manner to cause child unnecessary suffering or to endanger its health. In re Greenough, 116 Vt. 277, 75 A.2d 569 (1950).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Term "endanger" in the cruelty to children statute refers to a potential or possibility of injury. The term does not refer to conduct that will result or actually results in harm, but rather to conduct that could or might result in harm. State v. Amsden, 194 Vt. 128, 75 A.3d 612 (2013).
       </p>

        <b>
         3. Willfulness.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Willful conduct is, at a minimum, conduct undertaken intentionally and by design, as distinguished from that which is thoughtless or accidental. As a logical matter, to intentionally and designedly - or consciously and purposefully - expose or neglect a child in a manner that endangers that child, a defendant must have some knowledge of those dangerous conditions; thus, it is sufficient that a defendant consciously and purposefully cause a child to be exposed to conditions that she knows endanger his health. State v. Amsden, 194 Vt. 128, 75 A.3d 612 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence supported a finding that defendant's conduct was willful under the cruelty-to-children statute when defendant took her four-year-old son under a bridge in an area littered with glass, feces, and trash adjacent to a brook to which the child had unfettered access, because so intoxicated that she could not supervise him, and engaged in sex without noticing her son's whereabouts. There was no suggestion that defendant accidentally or thoughtlessly took her son to an area she knew to be dangerous. State v. Amsden, 194 Vt. 128, 75 A.3d 612 (2013).
       </p>

         4. Particular cases.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In regard to a conviction for cruelty to a child, there was sufficient evidence to establish that the bridge abutment where the child was found was "dangerous and unhealthy." The area contained broken glass, feces, and urine; it was directly adjacent to a brook, access to which was unimpeded by any protective barrier; the child was without a shirt and barefoot; defendant did not notice that her child had wandered away; and even if defendant had been aware of her child's movements in this obviously dangerous area, the trial court concluded she would have been unable to assist him, if needed, because of her inebriation. State v. Amsden, 194 Vt. 128, 75 A.3d 612 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Phrase "in a manner to endanger" can have no meaning independent of the verbs it modifies in the cruelty to children statute, nor can the verbs as used in this statute be understood without reference to the modifying phrase. The proscribed act, then, is not simply neglecting or exposing, but neglecting or exposing in a manner to endanger the child's health or welfare; to trigger criminal liability, the mental state that must accompany this unitary act is willfulness. State v. Amsden, 194 Vt. 128, 75 A.3d 612 (2013).

        Upon examination of the statutes for sexual assault and sexual assault of a vulnerable adult, it could not be concluded that the arguably irrational disparity in punishments between them with respect to sexual assault demonstrated a clear legislative intent to allow cumulative punishments under the circumstances of defendant's case, where he had engaged in one incident with the victim.

        Trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal of exploiting a vulnerable adult, as there was sufficient evidence, including witness testimony about the power of attorney defendant held for his mother and the power of attorney document itself, to create a question for the jury as to whether the power of attorney was validly executed.

       </h5>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for exploitation of a vulnerable adult, the trial court's instruction was undoubtedly circular; in effect, the trial court instructed jurors that they could find that defendant acted without legal authority if they found that he did not have legal authority to act. Reversal was not required, however, because the issue was clearly framed for the jury; the jurors could find that defendant was his mother's attorney-in-fact, and had legal authority, if they found the power of attorney's conditions had been met.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court erred when it equated the finding that defendant's mother was a "vulnerable adult" for purposes of conviction with incompetence for purposes of testimony at sentencing, and therefore admitted a statement by the mother's guardian instead of allowing the mother to testify. The error did not constitute an abuse of discretion in sentencing, however, because the trial court did not rely on the guardian's statement in its final sentencing determination, and the sentence was well below the maximum allowed. State v. Davis, 207 Vt. 346, 186 A.3d 1088 (Mar. 23, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Age-related impairment in a person's ability to, for example, manage his or her own finances does not foreclose the possibility that the person may still be capable of expressing himself or herself regarding a matter upon which he or she is called to testify. Thus, a person may be found to be a "vulnerable adult" and the victim of a charge of exploiting a vulnerable adult, but still competent to testify according to the Vermont Rules of Evidence and for the purposes of sentencing consideration. State v. Davis, 207 Vt. 346, 186 A.3d 1088 (Mar. 23, 2018).

      The Legislature finds and declares that it is the right of every person to enjoy the public peace and that sense of security and tranquility afforded by the protection of the law, and that wrongful activities motivated by hatred toward particular classes or groups of persons invade that protection.
    It is not the intent of this chapter to interfere with the exercise of rights protected by the constitutions of this State or the United States and the Legislature recognizes the constitutional rights of every citizen to harbor and express beliefs on any subject and to associate with others who share similar beliefs.

        There was no merit to an argument that any civil application of the hate crimes statute was unconstitutional. Rather than imposing a "criminal sanction," the hate crimes statute's relief is equitable in nature and provides protection for persons and property through injunctive relief; it does not necessarily expose a defendant to incarceration or require a heightened burden of proof. Shahi v. Madden, 188 Vt. 142, 5 A.3d 869 (2010).

         2. Requirements.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        There must be a showing of necessity for an injunction to issue under the hate crimes statute, though nothing in the statute imposes any specific period of limitation between the wrongful conduct and the injunction. The requirement is simply that the court find protection is reasonably necessary when assessing the present circumstances of the complainant; an inference can be made that the two-year limitation on the injunction present in the statute provides an outer limit to the time period in which an injunction must be sought. Shahi v. Madden, 188 Vt. 142, 5 A.3d 869 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to impose a hate crimes injunction, a trial court need find by a preponderance of the evidence: (1) defendant engaged, caused, or attempted to engage in wrongful conduct toward complainant; which caused the complainant damage, loss, or injury, including fear; (2) defendant was maliciously motivated by complainant's protected characteristics; and (3) injunctive relief is reasonably necessary to protect the complainant, the complainant's property, and other appropriate persons - including other members of the complainant's protected class - and their property. The "wrongful conduct" so proscribed need not result in criminal prosecution, as any civil relief can be sought independent of the State's actions; however, the complainant must still prove that it was more likely than not that the defendant committed a crime which both caused the complainant damages and was motivated by discriminatory animus. Shahi v. Madden, 188 Vt. 142, 5 A.3d 869 (2010).

         3. Particular cases.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Plaintiffs had not shown the nexus between the harmful acts and prohibited discriminatory animus required for the issuance of a hate crimes injunction. The one reference to any racial bias in all of the testimony at the hearing came when one witness admitted to referring to one plaintiff as a "towel head," but denied that defendant had ever done so; while there was testimony at a 2006 jury trial regarding defendant's discriminatory bias toward plaintiffs, such evidence was not submitted in the present proceeding and was not relied upon by the trial court in granting the injunction. Shahi v. Madden, 188 Vt. 142, 5 A.3d 869 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Possible imposition of criminal sanctions for violation of a hate-motivated crime injunction or the branding of a defendant as a "hate criminal" without a jury determination did not mandate striking down the hate crimes law or voiding a hate crimes injunction. Violation of any court-ordered injunction can expose a defendant to fines or incarceration for contempt, and such a possibility does not transform the injunction itself into a criminal sanction; likewise, the claimed necessity of a jury trial was without merit in this context, where the relief sought was equitable. Shahi v. Madden, 188 Vt. 142, 5 A.3d 869 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        In issuing a hate crimes injunction in 2009, the trial court erred in relying on the language of an earlier appellate decision in the case to support the finding of a hate-motivated crime. The issue of a hate-motivated crime was not adjudged in the 2006 trial and was neither appealed nor decided by the court; the court's dictum could not take the place of the physical or testimonial evidence required for the imposition of an injunction. Shahi v. Madden, 188 Vt. 142, 5 A.3d 869 (2010).

        Because statistics confirmed that escape from custody in violation of 13 V.S.A.
        §
        1501(a)(1) presented a serious potential risk of injury to another, that offense qualified as a predicate under the residual clause, 18 U.S.C.S.
        <span class="s1">
         §
        </span>
        924(e)(2)(b)(ii), of the Armed Career Criminal Act, 18 U.S.C.S.

       </p>
       <p>
        Because the U.S. Supreme Court's intervening decision in Chambers might have rendered the district court's reliance upon defendant's escape conviction as an Armed Career Criminal Act predicate erroneous, and because the district court had not had the occasion to consider whether the crimes underlying two of defendant's three sexual assault convictions arose from conduct committed on different occasions, the case was appropriately remanded. United States v. Daye, 571 F.3d 225 (2d Cir. 2009).

       <p>
        Breaking jail by a person lawfully imprisoned therein for any cause whatsoever was a felony at common law and by statute. State v. Shaw, 73 Vt. 149, 50 A. 863 (1901).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The facts known to the officer at the time defendant's arrest was made were sufficient, for purposes of the felony escape statute, to support an arrest for the commission of a felony, despite the officer's erroneous labelling of the charges as misdemeanors.
    The facts set forth in the charging affidavit were obtained from a sworn statement of defendant's girlfriend, who stated
    that defendant placed a loaded pistol to her head and threatened to shoot her.
    This fact, in conjunction with other information, provided sufficient probable cause to support an arrest for aggravated domestic assault under 13 V.S.A.
        §
        1043(a)(2), a felony. State v. Powell, 167 Vt. 294, 707 A.2d 272 (mem.) (1997).

        .
       </h5>
       <p>
        There is no escape absent lawful custody.
    Lawful custody does not arise until a defendant is brought under a police officer's control through physical restraint, or submits to the officer's authority.
    A suspect who resists arrest, for example, by fleeing when a police officer tells him to "freeze" is not in "custody" until his liberty is restrained. State v. Turgeon, 165 Vt. 28, 676 A.2d 339 (1996).

       <p>
        Neither federal nor state concepts of double jeopardy reach disciplinary action imposed upon inmates for breach of confinement in the course of the administration of a correctional institution; thus, such action constitutes no constitutional barrier to prosecution for crime of escape. State v. Lebo, 129 Vt. 449, 282 A.2d 804 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution for escape from prison farm, evidence offered by defendant relating to his administrative segregation and loss of good time credit following his capture and return was properly excluded as against claim it should have been received on double jeopardy issue, because such administrative action is not covered by double jeopardy concepts and there could thus be no double jeopardy. State v. Lebo, 129 Vt. 449, 282 A.2d 804 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prisoner confined under sentence for escape from jail in which he had been confined following arrest, who sought, by post-conviction relief, invalidation of his conviction and release on the ground that he was illegally detained at the time he escaped, could not successfully claim that alleged defects in his original apprehension and continued confinement gave rise to a right to escape prior to adjudication of such issues where several new charges were lodged against him prior to his escape, a lawful basis for his restraint for such charges was established, and he was at all times fully informed of his rights, he had counsel, was free to test his confinement by habeas corpus and plead guilty to escape charge. In re Provencher, 127 Vt. 558, 255 A.2d 180 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Desire for liberty, constraining lawfully confined jail inmate to flee, was not, no matter how strong, a defense to escape from jail charge. In re Provencher, 127 Vt. 558, 255 A.2d 180 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was no defense that respondent left jail under orders to work at a certain place, and that, being without a guard, he left that place; for the law had dominion over him as well after he left the jail as before. State v. Wright, 81 Vt. 281, 69 A. 761 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        Nor is it any defense that respondent's desire for liberty constrained him to flee, for, however strong that desire, it was still his duty to submit himself to the restraints of the law. State v. Wright, 81 Vt. 281, 69 A. 761 (1908).

        Where prisoner escaped from work release, was charged with escape from furlough, and at close of state's evidence moved for acquittal on ground of variance between the proof, which if anything showed escape from work release, and the information, refusal of motion, and allowing state to amend information to charge escape from work release, was not error. State v. Burclaff, 138 Vt. 461, 418 A.2d 38 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Motion to dismiss complaint on ground that information charged escape from state prison while evidence established escape from prison farm was properly denied where farm was maintained at, an integral part of, and under the supervision of the warden of, the state prison, so that his escape from the prison farm was in fact an escape from prison, and where complaint identified respondent, alleged time and place of escape with sufficient certainty to enable him to prepare a defense, and sufficiently stated facts essential to afford protection against a second conviction for the same offense. State v. Lebo, 129 Vt. 449, 282 A.2d 804 (1971).

        Information stating that accused escaped from the Rutland county jail while in lawful custody was not ambiguous and properly set forth the nature and cause of the accusation and left no doubt that it was under subdiv.

        Breaking from a village lock-up was an offense under V.S.
        §
        5094 which relates to breaking of "a jail or other place in which a person is confined by authority of the state." State v. Dohney, 72 Vt. 260, 47 A. 785 (1899).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was an offense under the statute against breaking open a jail (Comp. Stat., chap. CVI,
        §
        11, p. 555) for a prisoner confined alone in jail to break it open in order to escape. State v. Fletcher, 32 Vt. 427 (1859).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Even though the term "order" was not technically used to describe the document governing defendant's furlough, it was executed in accordance with 28 V.S.A.
        §
        808 by the Commissioner's authority; thus, there was sufficient evidence proving that the conditional reentry form and weekly schedules were an order for purposes of the escape statute. State v. Stanley, 182 Vt. 565, 933 A.2d 184 (mem.) (July 16, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        State met its burden of demonstrating substantial and admissible evidence as to elements of furlough escape, and therefore defendant's motion to dismiss was properly denied. State v. Parker, 170 Vt. 571, 744 A.2d 434 (mem.) (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where prisoner's furlough record sheet, a log showing who had been released and on what terms, was admitted through desk officer at correctional center, who testified record was regularly prepared and that a number of checks were built into the preparation, and prisoner, tried for escape from work release, failed to adduce any proof throwing suspicion on genuineness of the record, it was not error to admit the record to show prisoner was released pursuant to valid work release order and that he violated that order. State v. Burclaff, 138 Vt. 461, 418 A.2d 38 (1980).

       <p>
        The expenses incurred by the Department of Corrections for the extradition of defendant, who pled guilty to escape, did not constitute nontaxable costs of prosecution, as defendant had purposely attempted to evade the law, resulting in pecuniary damages suffered by the State. State v. Lewis, 167 Vt. 533, 711 A.2d 669 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        The mere fact that a restitution award for extradition expenses exceeded the maximum fine allowable for escape did not make it improper, because the Legislature did not intend to limit such damages based on the dollar amount in the charge against the defendant. State v. Lewis, 167 Vt. 533, 711 A.2d 669 (1998).

       <p>
        In construing 13 V.S.A.
        §
        1701, the court aims to effect legislative intent, and although penal statutes should be interpreted in a manner most favorable to the accused, they should not be interpreted so strictly as to defeat the legislative purpose in enacting the law; had the legislature intended "injury to the person" to mean only bodily injury it would have used the term bodily or physical injury.

         3. Threat.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        A threat within meaning of this section is a menace of such a nature as to unsettle the mind of person on whom it is intended to operate, and to take from his acts that freedom essential to constitute voluntary consent. State v. Louanis, 79 Vt. 463, 65 A. 532 (1907).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was proper for court to refuse to charge that threat must be such as to overcome will of an ordinarily prudent man, and to leave it to jury to say whether threat was calculated to disturb and unsettle a man's mind and give anxiety. State v. Louanis, 79 Vt. 463, 65 A. 532 (1907).

         1. Evidence.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        With regard to a conviction of giving false information to a police officer with intent to deflect, the evidence presented reasonably and fairly supported the jury's conclusion that defendant, by providing the police officers with his first and middle name and an incorrect birth year, intended to deflect their investigation away from himself. State v. Albarelli, 203 Vt. 551, 159 A.3d 627 (Nov. 18, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court refuses to hold that evidence of a defendant giving a false name alone is never sufficient to sustain a conviction under the false reports statute and, as with all other cases involving circumstantial evidence, the court must look at the record as a whole and determine if it can fairly and reasonably convince a jury of guilt. State v. Albarelli, 203 Vt. 551, 159 A.3d 627 (Nov. 18, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        When defendant was charged with felony possession of cocaine, misdemeanor possession of marijuana, and misdemeanor providing false information to an officer, it was proper to allow testimony that he had a handcuff key in his shoe. Possession of a means to escape arrest might be an indication that he had a plan to deflect investigation, a plan that included fleeing possible prosecution; furthermore, possession of the key triggered a reasonable inference that he knew his behavior of possessing illegal substances was illegal and had taken steps to avoid prosecution and punishment. State v. Delaoz, 189 Vt. 385, 22 A.3d 388 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly refused to give a limiting instruction that testimony regarding a handcuff key possessed by defendant was not evidence of possession of drugs or false information to a police officer. The court refused to issue such an instruction because it concluded that the evidence was relevant to the intent element present in all of the charges. State v. Delaoz, 189 Vt. 385, 22 A.3d 388 (2010).
       </p>
      </div>
      <div>

        <b>
         2. Double jeopardy.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Charge of impeding a public officer required proof that defendant committed the unlawful act of giving false information to a police officer implicating his wife. In effect, the impeding charge incorporated the false information charge, making false information a predicate offense to defendant's conviction for impeding, and in such circumstances, a guilty verdict obtained on both the predicate and compounding offense violated the Double Jeopardy Clause. State v. Neisner, 189 Vt. 160, 16 A.3d 597 (2010).
       </p>
      </div>
      <div>

        <b>
         3. Intent.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Under the false reports statute, the prohibition of false speech is directly linked to a defendant's intent to deflect a government investigation, thus preventing government waste. The court does not read the statute to criminalize all false statements to law enforcement agents, regardless of a defendant's intent; rather, the statute prohibits false statements intended to deflect an investigation. State v. Albarelli, 203 Vt. 551, 159 A.3d 627 (Nov. 18, 2016).
       </p>
      </div>
      <div>
       <h5 id="t13p01c41s1754-annotations-4">
        <b>
         4. Elements.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        To violate the false reports statute, an individual must give false information to a law enforcement officer to achieve his or her conscious objective of directing the investigation away from him or herself. State v. Albarelli, 203 Vt. 551, 159 A.3d 627 (Nov. 18, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Intent to deflect an investigation away from one's self is an essential element of the false reports statute, which the State bears the burden of proving. State v. Albarelli, 203 Vt. 551, 159 A.3d 627 (Nov. 18, 2016).

        <b>
         5. Jury instructions.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        New trial on the false information count was required. Neither the charge nor the State's trial evidence identified precisely what information the jury needed to evaluate with respect to this count, and given defendant's multiple statements and the two distinct ways in which a violation of the statute could occur, the Court could not be certain that the jury unanimously agreed that all, or at least one, of defendant's statements met the same statutory elements. State v. Redmond, - Vt.
    - , 234 A.3d 958 (May 15, 2020).

        Making or altering an instrument not named in this section was a misdemeanor at common law, but was not punishable by sentence to state prison. State v. Morton, 27 Vt. 310 (1855).

        Severing an endorsement from a note and leaving note entire was not a forgery within meaning of this section, but was nevertheless a misdemeanor at common law, and could be punished by fine and imprisonment. State v. McLeran, 1 Aik. 311 (1826).

       </p>
       <p>
        Forged paper must be such that, if genuine, it could injure another, and it must appear from indictment that it was legally of such a character, either from a recital or description of instrument itself, or, if that alone did not show it to be so, then by additional averment of such extrinsic facts as render it of that character.

       <p>
        In this section words "bond or writing obligatory" were used in their legal sense as meaning bonds binding some obligor to some obligee, and requiring something to be done, which, if not done, could be compensated by an action on bond. State v. Briggs, 34 Vt. 501 (1861).

        Information and warrant alleging, in terms of this section, that accused did "forge or counterfeit" were not thereby defective by making statement of offense uncertain, as such terms, though used in the alternative, signify the same thing and act. State v. Woodmansee, 128 Vt. 467, 266 A.2d 448 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Gist of crime of forgery is intent to defraud, and it was not necessary that information state the name of a particular person or entity which accused intended to defraud. State v. Woodmansee, 128 Vt. 467, 266 A.2d 448 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        That state may have used forged check in prior prosecution of a person for aiding and abetting the forging and cashing of the check by a person not the defendant in the instant case would not deprive state of probable cause to issue an information against defendant charging him with forging the check.

        It is trial court's duty to determine whether or not a writing offered as a standard of a person's handwriting is genuine and admissible, although it is the right and duty of the jury to judge for themselves as to the sufficiency of the proof that the writing is genuine.

       <p>
        Where state's attorney was not a witness to any of the facts introduced in prosecution for forgery, there was no indication that he could offer any evidence as to defendant's guilt or innocence, and the state's motives in prosecution of prior case in which it was alleged that defendant there aided and abetted the forgery by a person not the instant defendant of the same check involved in the instant case were not material to the cause, and state was not barred from bringing instant case by reason of charging, in prior case, that another person had forged the check, denial of defendant's request to call state's attorney or a witness regarding state's inconsistency as to the forger was not error. State v. Woodmansee, 128 Vt. 467, 266 A.2d 448 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where prison warden saw letters purporting to be signed by defendant and sent to warden, and had communicated with defendant regarding them and acted on requests they contained, he was properly permitted to testify, in prosecution for forgery, that in his opinion the letters were in defendant's handwriting, and they were properly received as standards.

        The uttering, passing and giving in payment a counterfeit bank bill are distinct offenses; and an indictment for uttering and passing such bill, averring knowledge of respondent that bill was counterfeit was sufficient though it did not allege that respondent uttered and passed it as a true bill.

        Indictment for having in possession counterfeit coin need not aver that denomination of coin which was counterfeited was "current by law, or usage, in this state," it being averred, that the coin was one of the current silver coins of the United States. State v. Griffin, 18 Vt. 198 (1846).

        This section was intended to reach every part of apparatus of coining, however much more might be necessary to make that effective; therefore, if it was shown that respondent had in his possession one half of a mould, it was sufficient, without proof that he also had the other half.

         1. Elements of offense.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        There are three elements to the offense of false pretenses: first, the offender must act with intent to defraud; second, the offender must use a fraudulent device or artifice, such as a bad check; and, third, the offender must actually obtain money or property with a value in excess of $25.00. State v. Foley, 140 Vt. 643, 443 A.2d 452 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        False personation of another, with the intent thereby fraudulently to obtain property, is a "false pretense," within meaning of this section. State v. Marshall, 77 Vt. 262, 59 A. 916 (1905).
       </p>
       <p>
        If state shows that respondent obtained check by falsely personating another, but person so personated had no interest in check and it was not intended to be delivered to him, unless he was respondent, then the respondent may be convicted under this section. State v. Marshall, 77 Vt. 262, 59 A. 916 (1905).
       </p>
       <p>
        If false assertion is made in regard to article, and money is thereby fraudulently obtained, the falsehood is a false pretense within statute against obtaining money by false pretenses, if, in order to ascertain whether the representation is false, it is necessary to apply tests or experiments to the article. In re Greenough, 31 Vt. 279 (1858).
       </p>

         2. Construction with other law.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Whether defendant could be found guilty of the statutory crime of false pretenses does not depend on whether he could have been found liable in superior court based on a civil fraud complaint. State v. Agosta, 173 Vt. 97, 787 A.2d 1252 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        The crime of false pretenses is different crime from the crime of bad checks, governed by section 2022 of this title. State v. Foley, 140 Vt. 643, 443 A.2d 452 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The elements of the offenses of false pretenses and of issuing or passing bad checks differ since conviction for false pretenses requires proof of intent to defraud, while mere knowledge suffices for the bad check crime, since one must actually obtain property to be convicted for false pretenses, which is not a requirement under section 2022 of this title, governing bad checks, and, finally, since there are permissive presumptions for finding criminal intent under section 2022 which are unavailable under this section. State v. Foley, 140 Vt. 643, 443 A.2d 452 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        A person could pass a check, knowing it would be dishonored, but fully intending to make good on the underlying obligation, which would be a defense to a false pretenses prosecution, but the person would be guilty of the bad check crime under section 2022 of this title. State v. Foley, 140 Vt. 643, 443 A.2d 452 (1982).

        Where a check is good when issued, but a person subsequently decides to defraud the payee and stop payment, prosecution lies for false pretenses, but not for the crime of issuing or passing a bad check under section 2022 of this title. State v. Foley, 140 Vt. 643, 443 A.2d 452 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The property requirements of this section preclude conviction for issuing bad checks as gifts, yet the same act is culpable under section 2022 of this title, governing bad checks. State v. Foley, 140 Vt. 643, 443 A.2d 452 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        While there is significant overlap between this section and section 2022 of this title, governing bad checks, that alone is insufficient to effect an implied repeal of this section. State v. Foley, 140 Vt. 643, 443 A.2d 452 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        There are too many differences between this section and section 2022 of this title, governing bad checks, to hold them repugnant or to conclude that section 2022 is a substitute for this section, particularly where the legislature has deliberately left both sections intact. State v. Foley, 140 Vt. 643, 443 A.2d 452 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Action of the legislature, taken two years after enacting section 2022 of this title, governing bad checks, in repealing the portion of this section that provided for lesser penalties for thefts involving less than $25.00 indicated that the legislature was well aware of the law and chose to leave the remainder of this section intact, coexisting with section 2022, and precluded a judicial excision of this section. State v. Foley, 140 Vt. 643, 443 A.2d 452 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Courts in other jurisdictions have endorsed implied repeal of the false pretenses section by the section governing bad checks only when the bad check section was drafted to completely incorporate the false pretenses section. State v. Foley, 140 Vt. 643, 443 A.2d 452 (1982).

       </h5>
       <p>
        To establish the element of intent to defraud, statements of intention falsely representing a present state of mind - including false promises of future action - will suffice. State v. Agosta, 173 Vt. 97, 787 A.2d 1252 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        The "intent to defraud" element requires a scheme to cheat the victim. State v. Agosta, 173 Vt. 97, 787 A.2d 1252 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the case of defendant convicted of obtaining money or other property by false pretenses, criminal intent as to the victim was not lacking where defendant knew that his false statement to the victim's sister would be passed on to the victim and where he intended thereby to induce her to part with her money. State v. Bissonette, 145 Vt. 381, 488 A.2d 1231 (1985).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The only materiality requirement imposed with respect to the crime of false pretenses is that the victim must have materially relied upon the misrepresentation. State v. Agosta, 173 Vt. 97, 787 A.2d 1252 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution for false pretenses arising from the sale of weapons, defendant's letterhead concerning his licensing status falsely represented a material fact and thus qualified for the crime of false pretenses, given the victim's testimony that (1) he assumed he was purchasing the weapons from a federally licensed dealer; (2) he relied upon defendant's written representation as to that fact; and (3) he would not have given defendant his money and gone through with the transaction had he known that defendant did not in fact have the licenses he claimed he did. State v. Agosta, 173 Vt. 97, 787 A.2d 1252 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Victim of fraud need not have relied solely upon the false representation in parting with his money, but only materially upon it. State v. Bissonette, 145 Vt. 381, 488 A.2d 1231 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the case of defendant convicted of obtaining money or other property by false pretenses, evidence that defendant falsely stated that he had been working across the street from the victim's home and had noticed shingles missing from her roof, that he pretended to talk over the telephone with the woman whose approval was needed for repairs and then misrepresented her approval, permitted the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim acted in material reliance upon defendant's falsehood when she paid for the repairs. State v. Bissonette, 145 Vt. 381, 488 A.2d 1231 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the case of defendant convicted of obtaining money or other property by false pretenses where extrinsic evidence of the victim's reliance on defendant's false representations was clear, trial court was justified in denying defendant's request that the victim be ordered to undergo psychiatric examination to determine whether she was mentally competent to rely on defendant's representations. State v. Bissonette, 145 Vt. 381, 488 A.2d 1231 (1985).

       </p>
       <p>
        Presentation for payment of a third party's check by a person who knows payment on that check has been stopped, but makes no express written or oral representation with respect thereto, constitutes the crime of obtaining money by false pretenses under this section. State v. Allen, 146 Vt. 569, 507 A.2d 975 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        One can commit the crime of false pretenses under this section by the making of a direct or express representation, whether oral or written, without passing a false token, or by passing a false token, such as a check, and the false representation may be shown indirectly or by implication or by the conduct of the person presenting the check for payment.

        Where person obtained property in this state by deceitfully representing in a letter written without the state that he was another person and by falsely personating that other person in an interview within this state with the person to whom the letter was sent and from whom the property was obtained, offense of obtaining property by false pretenses was committed in this state.

        Where note was in blank form when respondent obtained employee's signature on representation that it was a paper that had to do with the employee's social security and thereafter filled in the blanks and discounted the note at the bank, it was proper for information charging false pretenses to set forth the instrument in blank. State v. Quesnel, 124 Vt. 491, 207 A.2d 155 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        An information was sufficient which charged that respondent defrauded another, inducing him to deliver to respondent a large number of sheep, which he converted to his own use, by unlawfully, knowingly, designedly, and falsely pretending that a designated person in Boston had already mailed to respondent a check at such a time that by the course of regular mail it would be delivered to respondent in the afternoon of that same day and that respondent then and there well knew that said check had not been so mailed and would not be so delivered, but made said false representations with intent to defraud. State v. Ricker, 81 Vt. 456, 70 A. 1059 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not necessary to allege that respondent knew pretenses to be false, if it was alleged that he designedly made them with intent to defraud. State v. Switzer, 63 Vt. 604, 22 A. 724 (1891).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was sufficient to allege that signature was obtained by false pretenses, setting forth what they were, and a further description of them as "inducements" and "representations" did no harm, being mere tautology. State v. Switzer, 63 Vt. 604, 22 A. 724 (1891).

       <p>
        In prosecution for false pretenses arising from the sale of weapons, evidence of defendant's failure both to follow through on the paperwork necessary for transfer of the weapons and to notify the victim of his change of address entitled the jury to conclude that defendant intended to defraud the victim and to convict him of false pretenses. State v. Agosta, 173 Vt. 97, 787 A.2d 1252 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution for obtaining money and other property from several companies by false tokens, consisting of checks drawn on banks, well knowing that drawer was not then entitled to draw thereon for amount of respective checks, with intent to defraud such companies, and for uttering and publishing forged instruments, consisting of such checks, for same fraudulent purpose, it was unnecessary to show corporate existence of banks on which checks were drawn, since they were not parties allegedly defrauded.

         2. Jurisdiction.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        County court had jurisdiction over prosecution for false advertising under this section where allegedly false advertisements appeared in newspaper sold and distributed in the county even though the material may have been written and printed elsewhere. State v. Jost, 127 Vt. 120, 241 A.2d 316 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        To establish criminal responsibility it is not necessary that the offender do every act necessary to complete the crime within the state where he is prosecuted. State v. Jost, 127 Vt. 120, 241 A.2d 316 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        One who while absent from the jurisdiction commits an offense within the state by means of an innocent agency may be held liable in that state if that is where the crime is accomplished. State v. Jost, 127 Vt. 120, 241 A.2d 316 (1968).

         3. Elements.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        To make false advertising an offense under this section, it is not necessary that any person be cheated or defrauded by a false statement, but only that the material was false and intentionally circulated to induce the public to buy the property or service offered. State v. Jost, 127 Vt. 120, 241 A.2d 316 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Making it an offense under this section to knowingly make or circulate an untrue, deceptive or misleading advertisement forbids the circulation as an inducement to business transactions of untrue, deceptive or misleading representations of fact concerning goods and services offered for sale. State v. Jost, 127 Vt. 120, 241 A.2d 316 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        False representations and broken promises referring merely to the future do not constitute ground for establishing legal liability for fraud and deceit. State v. Jost, 127 Vt. 120, 241 A.2d 316 (1968).

         4. Question for jury.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where the language of false representation referring to the future is susceptible of a construction which makes the statement applicable to present conditions, the interpretation of representation is for the trier of facts. State v. Jost, 127 Vt. 120, 241 A.2d 316 (1968).

         5. Sufficiency of evidence.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Inconsistency between defendant's claim in advertisement that he had four doctorates and evidence that he had stated in application for admission to a university and in application for a teaching position that he was a "doctor and," meaning that he had undertaken graduate study for a doctorate, did not establish falsity of advertising for purposes of criminal prosecution. State v. Jost, 127 Vt. 120, 241 A.2d 316 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Conviction under this section could not be sustained where findings of false representations were predicated on defendant's asserted want of credibility rather than on affirmative and substantial evidence of his guilt. State v. Jost, 127 Vt. 120, 241 A.2d 316 (1968).

         6. Findings.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Finding that defendant's use of word "granting," in advertisement for college with two and four-year programs granting associate and bachelor degrees, referred to authority then existing to grant degrees was warranted. State v. Jost, 127 Vt. 120, 241 A.2d 316 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Advertisement soliciting applicants for college with two and four-year programs granting associate and bachelor degrees was false, deceptive, and misleading within prohibition of this section insofar as the school was not then empowered to grant degrees. State v. Jost, 127 Vt. 120, 241 A.2d 316 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Alleged fact that youth of country should not be exposed to defendant's philosophies, teachings and corrupting influence afforded no proper basis for conviction of false advertising to obtain applicants for admission to a college where defendant had never made his character an issue. State v. Jost, 127 Vt. 120, 241 A.2d 316 (1968).

         7. Review.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        On appeal from conviction of false advertising under this section, the question before the reviewing court was whether the subordinate findings were sufficient in law to sustain trial court's conclusion as to defendant's guilt. State v. Jost, 127 Vt. 120, 241 A.2d 316 (1968).

         8. Interstate commerce.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        This section making it an offense to knowingly make or circulate an untrue, deceptive or misleading advertisement in a newspaper, magazine or other publication or in form of a book, notice, etc., does not impose an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. State v. Jost, 127 Vt. 120, 241 A.2d 316 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        A statute relating to advertising that is addressed to a proper and traditional subject of the police power does not violate the commerce clause when not in conflict with the federal scheme. State v. Jost, 127 Vt. 120, 241 A.2d 316 (1968).

       § 2022. Bad checks.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A person who issues or passes a check or similar sight order for the payment of money, knowing that it will not be honored by the drawee, shall be imprisoned for not more than one year or fined not more than $1,000.00, or both.
    The court shall order restitution in the amount of the check or order, together with a service charge not to exceed $5.00, if it is established that the defendant has the ability to pay.
    For the purposes of this section, it may be inferred that the issuer knew that the check or order, other than a post-dated check or order, would not be paid if:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t13p01c47s2022ol11">

       the issuer had insufficient funds with the drawee at the time the check or order was issued or presented for payment, and
       <ol type="A">
        <li id="t13p01c47s2022ol12A">
         the check or order was presented to the drawee for payment not more than 30 days after the date of issuance; and

        <li id="t13p01c47s2022ol12B">
         payment was refused by the drawee for reasons other than seizure or attachment of the issuer's funds by order of a court or authorized governmental agency; and

        <li id="t13p01c47s2022ol12C">

       </h5>
       <p>
        The state must prove two elements to obtain a conviction for violating this section: (1) that the defendant issued or passed a check, and (2) that the defendant had knowledge that it would not be honored. State v. McBurney, 145 Vt. 201, 484 A.2d 926 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        The offense of issuing or passing bad checks has two elements: first, the offender must issue or pass a check; and, second, at the same time the offender must have knowledge that the check will not be paid, which knowledge may be presumed if the offender drew the check on a fictitious account or failed to provide sufficient funds to pay the check within ten days of notice of dishonor. State v. Foley, 140 Vt. 643, 443 A.2d 452 (1982).

        Criminal prosecution for passing bad checks under 13 V.S.A.
        §
        2022 was excepted from the automatic stay under 11 U.S.C.S.
        <span class="s1">
         §
        </span>
        362(b)(1); therefore, a debtor found no relief by filing an action against a prosecutor to enjoin a criminal proceeding, even though restitution was a possible remedy. Prosecutor's motivation was not material. Pickett v. Quinn (In re Pickett), 321 B.R. 663 (Bankr. D. Vt. 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        The crime of false pretenses, governed by section 2002 of this title, is a different crime from the crime of bad checks. State v. Foley, 140 Vt. 643, 443 A.2d 452 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The elements of the offenses of false pretenses and of issuing or passing bad checks differ since conviction for false pretenses requires proof of intent to defraud, while mere knowledge suffices for the bad check crime, since one must actually obtain property to be convicted for false pretenses, which is not a requirement under this section and, finally, since there are permissive presumptions for finding criminal intent under this section which are unavailable under section 2002 of this title, governing false pretenses. State v. Foley, 140 Vt. 643, 443 A.2d 452 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        A person could pass a check, knowing it would be dishonored, but fully intending to make good on the underlying obligation, which would be a defense to a false pretenses prosecution under section 2002 of this title, but the person would be guilty of the bad check crime. State v. Foley, 140 Vt. 643, 443 A.2d 452 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a check is good when issued, but a person subsequently decides to defraud the payee and stop payment, prosecution lies for false pretenses under section 2002 of this title, but not for the crime of issuing or passing a bad check. State v. Foley, 140 Vt. 643, 443 A.2d 452 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The property requirements of section 2002 of this title, governing false pretenses, preclude conviction for issuing bad checks as gifts, yet the same act is culpable under this section. State v. Foley, 140 Vt. 643, 443 A.2d 452 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        While there is significant overlap between section 2002 of this title, governing false pretenses, and this section, that alone is insufficient to effect an implied repeal of section 2002. State v. Foley, 140 Vt. 643, 443 A.2d 452 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        There are too many differences between section 2002 of this title, governing false pretenses, and this section to hold them repugnant or to conclude that this section is a substitute for section 2002, particularly where the legislature has deliberately left both sections intact. State v. Foley, 140 Vt. 643, 443 A.2d 452 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Action of the legislature, taken two years after enacting this section, in repealing the portion of section 2002 of this title, governing false pretenses, that provided for lesser penalties for thefts involving less than $ 25.00, indicated that the legislature was well aware of the law and chose to leave the remainder of section 2002 intact, coexisting with this section, and precluded a judicial excision of section 2002. State v. Foley, 140 Vt. 643, 443 A.2d 452 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Courts in other jurisdictions have endorsed implied repeal of the false pretenses section by the bad check section only when the bad check section was drafted to completely incorporate the false pretenses section. State v. Foley, 140 Vt. 643, 443 A.2d 452 (1982).

         1. Evidence.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Circumstantial evidence was sufficient grounds for denying a motion for judgment of acquittal on a charge of home improvement fraud. There was uncontested evidence that when defendant abandoned the project, he had left the interior work largely incomplete, the roof not entirely tied into the existing house, and the siding on the ground; furthermore, just a few weeks before leaving the project incomplete, defendant cashed checks from the homeowners totaling $15,000 and ceased communicating with the homeowners. State v. Rounds, 189 Vt. 447, 22 A.3d 477 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's alternate theory supporting his argument that he should have been acquitted of home improvement fraud - that the homeowners sufficiently changed the terms of the contract such that his actions over the summer could not provide any evidence as to his intent under the original contract - failed. Any change in the sourcing of materials or the selection or payment of a few subcontractors did not alter the fact that defendant accepted significant monies from homeowners shortly before leaving the job and cutting off communication. State v. Rounds, 189 Vt. 447, 22 A.3d 477 (2011).

         2. Defenses.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Vermont's home-improvement-fraud law permits conviction if the defendant knowingly promises performance he does not intend to perform or knows will not be performed, in whole or in part. This language suggests that substantial performance is not a complete defense to home improvement fraud in Vermont. State v. Rounds, 189 Vt. 447, 22 A.3d 477 (2011).
       </p>
      </div>

        <b>
         3. Jury instructions.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In a trial for home improvement fraud, the instruction on the permissive inference was flawed. The instruction eliminated the statutory elements that defendant knowingly promised performance he knew would not be performed and that homeowners requested performance or a refund. State v. Rounds, 189 Vt. 447, 22 A.3d 477 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Giving a permissive inference instruction that lacked evidentiary support and did not correctly state the law was plain error in a trial for home improvement fraud. The error was obvious; it was prejudicial because it directly undermined defendant's case without providing him an opportunity to respond; and the jury might have relied upon the presumption rather than upon the evidence and thus convicted defendant based on a standard less rigorous than the Constitution or the statute at issue required. State v. Rounds, 189 Vt. 447, 22 A.3d 477 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a trial for home improvement fraud, there was no evidence to permit instructing the jury on the permissive inference. The State's proffered testimony did not suggest that the homeowners ever actually requested that defendant perform on the contract or refund their money before they severed their relationship. State v. Rounds, 189 Vt. 447, 22 A.3d 477 (2011).

         4. Strict liability.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Failing to comply with the statute imposing a notice and surety requirement upon offenders previously convicted of home improvement fraud is a strict liability offense, given the absence of a common law presumption against strict liability; the statutory language, particularly the inclusion of "knowingly" elsewhere in the statute; and the fact that three Roy factors weighed in favor of strict liability. State v. Witham, 202 Vt. 97, 147 A.3d 1005 (2016).

        This section and
        §
        2174 of this title were originally passed as parts of an act, the declared intention of which was to suppress business conducted in bucket shops, and this intention was considered in construing these sections. State v. McMillan, 69 Vt. 105, 37 A. 278 (1896).

         2. Indictment.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        An offense under this section consists in keeping of prohibited place, and hence an indictment thereunder may be in general words, and need not set forth any particular transactions of pretended buying and selling. State v. Corcoran, 73 Vt. 404, 50 A. 1110 (1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        Term, "bucket shop," without any further explanation than language used in statute was sufficient designation as to place. State v. Corcoran, 73 Vt. 404, 50 A. 1110 (1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        Indictment, charging the respondent with keeping a bucket shop wherein prohibited business was conducted and permitted, was insufficient where it failed to allege directly that such business was conducted or permitted by respondent. State v. McMillan, 69 Vt. 105, 37 A. 278 (1896).

     <p>
      When a prosecution is commenced for the violation of a provision of sections 2171, 2173, 2174, or 2176 of this title, the State's Attorney may petition the presiding judge of the Superior Court to enjoin the carrying on of such unlawful business in the place where the complaint, information, or indictment charges that it has been conducted.
    Such presiding judge shall hear and determine such petition in the manner provided by law and the rules of civil procedure for the determination of causes and may, if the allegations therein are sustained, permanently enjoin the person, firm, or corporation shown to have kept or caused to have been kept such place, from conducting such prohibited business therein. The Superior Court or presiding judge may, upon petition therefor in such proceedings, issue a temporary injunction to effect, during the pendency of the petition, the closing of such place against such unlawful business.
    The costs of the proceedings authorized by this section shall be taxed against the defendant in case the State prevails.

         1. Constitutionality.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Aggravated murder statute and the first-degree murder statute themselves do not treat any particular individuals or classes of individuals differently; all are equally subject to the same legislatively conferred prosecutorial discretion to proceed under either statute as the circumstances may seem to justify in a given case. Defendants accused of murder during the course of a sexual assault are nowhere deemed or recognized as a protected class, and the risk that one prosecutor may pursue a mandatory life sentence while another may file for a more discretionary sentence in the event of different homicides arising from sexual assault is of no constitutional concern unless the choice results from impermissible racial, ethnic or gender biases. State v. Rooney, 189 Vt. 306, 19 A.3d 92 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Authority to charge aggravated murder, rather than felony murder, was of no more practical concern than the unfettered and broad discretion exercised daily by Vermont prosecutors. Certainly, on the record of this case, which failed to reflect any discriminatory treatment, it was of no constitutional concern either. State v. Rooney, 189 Vt. 306, 19 A.3d 92 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that defendant's conduct was punishable under either the aggravated murder statute or under the first-degree murder statute, which contained different penalties, did not violate equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. Because the circumstances were indistinguishable from those in the United States Supreme Court's decision of
        Batchelder,
        the broad holding of
        Batchelder
        foreclosed defendant's requested relief under the Fourteenth Amendment. State v. Rooney, 189 Vt. 306, 19 A.3d 92 (2011).

       <p>
        Deliberation is not an essential element of second-degree murder. First-degree murder is murder plus the elements of willfulness, deliberation and premeditation, and murder without these elements is second-degree murder. Murder without the first-degree elements, i.e., second-degree murder, consists simply of the unlawful killing of a person with "malice aforethought," which has been defined as "an intention to kill, an intention to do great bodily harm, or a wanton disregard of the likelihood that one's behavior may naturally cause death or great bodily harm." State v. Hatcher, 167 Vt. 338, 706 A.2d 429 (1997).

        In a murder trial, motive was not an element of the offense to be proven by the State. State v. Brochu, 183 Vt. 269, 949 A.2d 1035 (Mar. 7, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Murder defendant seeking a new trial had not shown that new evidence, either by itself or combined with alternative-perpetrator evidence, that her daughter had taken a rake from her home would probably change the trial result. The testimony of the daughter addressed only a collateral issue and did not call into question any element that the State had to prove at trial; the State was not required to locate or identify a murder weapon in order to prove its case. State v. Schreiner, 183 Vt. 42, 944 A.2d 250 (Dec. 14, 2007).

        The crime of second-degree murder requires an intention to kill, an intention to do great bodily harm, or a wanton disregard of the likelihood that one's behavior may naturally cause death or great bodily harm. State v. Sexton, 180 Vt. 34, 904 A.2d 1092 (June 9, 2006), overruled in part by State v. Congress, 2014 Vt. LEXIS 135 (Vt. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Absence of a deadly weapon in the traditional sense does not necessarily preclude an awareness of deadly risk for second-degree murder conviction. State v. Brunell, 159 Vt. 1, 615 A.2d 127 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Difference between implied intent to kill required for second-degree murder and criminally negligent conduct required for involuntary manslaughter is defendant's awareness of risk and degree of that risk; to be convicted of second-degree murder, defendant must subjectively be aware of deadly risk to victim, while defendant need not be actually aware of risk to victim to be guilty of involuntary manslaughter. State v. Brunell, 159 Vt. 1, 615 A.2d 127 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        For second-degree murder, extent of risk must be something more than that required for criminal negligence. State v. Brunell, 159 Vt. 1, 615 A.2d 127 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Test for determining defendant's awareness of risk in distinguishing second-degree murder from involuntary manslaughter is an objective one, focusing on what a reasonable person would appreciate the risk to be under all the facts and circumstances. State v. Brunell, 159 Vt. 1, 615 A.2d 127 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Premeditated first-degree murder requires state to prove intent to kill. State v. Johnson, 158 Vt. 508, 615 A.2d 132 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Essential elements of first-degree murder charge were included in information where information cited provision describing difference between first- and second-degree murder, and tracked statutory description of murder in first degree. State v. Towne, 158 Vt. 607, 615 A.2d 484 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Murder, whether first or second degree, requires an intent to kill, and the "wilful" element of this section denotes that intent. In re Dunham, 144 Vt. 444, 479 A.2d 144 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to constitute murder a homicide must have been committed with malice aforethought, defined as an intention to kill, an intention to do great bodily harm, or a wanton disregard of the likelihood that one's behavior may naturally cause death or great bodily harm. State v. Doucette, 143 Vt. 573, 470 A.2d 676 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Murder in the first degree requires proof of murderous intent with a purpose of mind to kill as distinguished from an act done upon sudden impulse without meditation or murderous intent. State v. Girouard, 135 Vt. 123, 373 A.2d 836 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly instructed the jury upon all of the elements of murder in the first degree where it told the jury that the act must be wilful, deliberate and premeditated and if any of those elements were not proved beyond a reasonable doubt the defendant could not be found guilty and then further defined those terms as they had been defined by case law. State v. Girouard, 135 Vt. 123, 373 A.2d 836 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Malice is an essential element of murder regardless of the degree of murder. State v. Battick, 133 Vt. 558, 349 A.2d 221 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plea of guilty to charge of first degree murder was an admission of the commission of the act with all its necessary elements, including malice, an element of all degrees of murder, and court had only to determine the degree of murder, so that it was not error to fail to specifically find malice where first degree murder was found. State v. Battick, 133 Vt. 558, 349 A.2d 221 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        To constitute murder in the first degree, the killing must have been willful, malicious and premeditated. State v. Reuschel, 131 Vt. 554, 312 A.2d 739 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Murder in the second degree involves malice, but not premeditation; and an instruction that it wants the elements of both malice and premeditation is erroneous. State v. Bradley, 64 Vt. 466, 24 A. 1053 (1892), same case 67 Vt. 465, 32 A. 238.

        There was sufficient evidence supporting the intent element of second-degree murder, so that defendant was not entitled to a judgment of acquittal, when there was uncontested witness testimony that defendant initially entered a interstate going in the proper direction, but then abruptly turned his vehicle around, headed north in the southbound lanes, and, before crashing into the victims' vehicle, passed at speeds approaching 90 mph several drivers who honked horns, flashed lights, or took evasive action; furthermore, the jury was not required to accept as fact defendant's reports of delusional thinking, which were undercut to some extent, apart from any expert testimony, by the testimony of persons who spoke or met with him before and after the incident. State v. Bourgoin, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (Mar. 12, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Not only did the State adequately rebut defendant's diminished capacity defense, but it also provided ample evidence in support of intent. The State's proof that defendant acted with a premeditated plan to murder his victims was demonstrated in three ways: (1) through crime scene investigation testimony with regard to location of victims and shots fired; (2) through testimony from people defendant encountered on the day of the shootings; and (3) through cross-examination of defendant's psychiatric expert. State v. Williams, 188 Vt. 413, 8 A.3d 1053 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was not entitled to an instruction on diminished capacity with regard to the intent element of first- and second-degree murder. Because the instruction given accurately reflected the standard for diminished capacity and its connection to the ability to form the requisite intent, inclusion of the instruction in the first- and second-degree murder instructions was harmless error. State v. Williams, 188 Vt. 413, 8 A.3d 1053 (2010).

        If resistance to authorized arrest which is properly being made results in death of arresting officer the crime is murder, regardless of the question of malice. State v. Shaw, 73 Vt. 149, 50 A. 863 (1901).

        Where the evidence established that shortly before the killing defendant shouted and pounded angrily on the door of the victim, that the victim suffered numerous incisions typical of defensive wounds, and bruises caused by blunt trauma, while defendant suffered a wound for which he never sought medical treatment, the jury could have concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that he possessed the mental state sufficient to support a conviction of second-degree murder, and could reasonably have rejected his claim that he acted out of passion or provocation in response to an attack by the victim. State v. Hatcher, 167 Vt. 338, 706 A.2d 429 (1997).

        If jury found that respondent entered upon the affray with murderous intent, respondent was fully protected when the instruction permitted the jury to consider whether his design was altered during the affray before the homicide, and to determine the character of the homicide, in accordance with such altered design.

        Even if the trial court erred in denying defendant's motion to suppress certain statements, the fact that the State had ample evidence to demonstrate that defendant possessed the requisite state of mind for the crimes charged without the statements combined with the cumulative nature of the statements led
    to the conclusion that any error in admitting these statements was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. There was ample evidence that defendant possessed the requisite mental state for murder, including (1) testimony from three people who interacted with defendant on the day of the shootings; (2) testimony from medical examiners and forensic investigators as to the location of the victims, the fact that multiple shots were fired, and (3) the fact that defendant shot all of his victims at close range; and the cross-examination of defendant's own psychiatric expert, who indicated his belief that defendant was capable of, and indeed did, commit the murders and attempted murders with deliberation and premeditation.

        It was proper to show that respondent had been confined in jail, but had escaped therefrom, had immediately thereafter armed himself with a rifle and had set out upon the flight in which he was overtaken when he fired, since such evidence tended to show that respondent had reason to suppose that he would be pursued by officers of the law, and that he intended to use the rifle in resistance of arrest if overtaken.

       <p>
        Voluntary manslaughter is an intentional killing committed under extenuating circumstances that may negate willfulness, such as sudden passion or provocation that would cause a reasonable person to lose control. Where passion or provocation is implicated, the court must instruct the jury that to establish murder the State must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused did not kill under the influence of passion or provocation. State v. Hatcher, 167 Vt. 338, 706 A.2d 429 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is lack of premeditation which distinguishes first degree from second degree murder. In re Dunham, 144 Vt. 444, 479 A.2d 144 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where respondent went into a barn and then left the same and walked smartly a distance of some fifteen or twenty feet before he shot the deceased there was time for forming premeditated determination to kill after respondent left the barn. State v. Doherty, 72 Vt. 381, 48 A. 658 (1900), appeal dismissed, 189 U.S. 514, 23 S. Ct. 850, 47 L. Ed. 925 (1903).

        When nothing else is wanting, no specific or particular length of time is necessary for premeditation to constitute murder in the first degree. State v. Carr, 53 Vt. 37 (1880).
       </p>
       <p>
        If design to kill be formed deliberately for ever so short a time before the infliction of the mortal wound, or if it be formed without such provocation as the law regards as sufficient justification for heat of blood and anger, the offense is murder. State v. McDonnell, 32 Vt. 491 (1860).

        Where at his trial for second-degree murder and felony murder defendant's claim that his voluntary intoxication was so great that he was not legally responsible for his actions was pursued at length, instruction on voluntary intoxication was given twice, without objection, and the evidence of voluntary intoxication, taken in the light most favorable to the state, was not so compelling as to prevent a jury from finding that defendant had the necessary intent, judgment of acquittal was not required as a matter of law.

        Voluntary intoxication does not excuse or palliate crime, or operate to reduce the degree of homicide where the perpetrator was previously in the requisite condition of mental responsibility.

       </p>
       <p>
        The ingestion of alcohol is a voluntary act, as the law sees it, and cannot excuse crime or reduce the degree of homicide where the requisite condition of mental responsibility is present; thus a person who drinks to brace himself for such an act, or drinks knowing that the effect of the alcohol will predispose him to violence, is engaging in a wilful act for which he must be held responsible and accountable. State v. Pease, 129 Vt. 70, 271 A.2d 835 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        While it is clear that intoxication can be so extreme as to rebut any ability of a respondent to formulate the malice necessary to make a deliberate act of killing reach the level of first degree murder, it should be understood that this is because of this actual and personal inability, under the circumstances, to achieve the state of mental responsibility under which malice is charged, due to intoxication. State v. Pease, 129 Vt. 70, 271 A.2d 835 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Reduction in the degree of homicide, based on the effects of intoxication, may be compared to the delusional or involuntary effects of insanity, and the issue is raised by evidence that the effect of the alcohol consumed made the actor irrational, and the homicide is a product of this irrational or delusional state rather than a knowing, conscious or deliberate act.

        The questions of the effect of the use of intoxicants, as actually evidenced, on the respondent's judgment and rationality, as to both questions of waiver of rights and malice, were for the jury. State v. Pease, 129 Vt. 70, 271 A.2d 835 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the evidence in the case did not present the issue of intoxication to an extent justifiably to be categorized as acute, respondent's request for an instruction that acute intoxication negates the capacity to harbor malice was properly denied.

       </p>
       <p>
        Insofar as intoxication of defendant at time he committed alleged first-degree murder was a factor in determining the existence of premeditation and malice, the jury was entitled to consider its effect on defendant's ability to develop the requisite condition of mental responsibility, and trial court should have so charged.

        In addition to DNA and other forensic evidence, other evidence supported the State's case that defendant was the perpetrator of the victim's murder. The jury had ample reason to conclude that the defendant had lied when telling crucial parts of his story, including testimony by witnesses that contradicted that of defendant, the fact that defendant's story changed each time he spoke to police, testimony by a co-worker that defendant asked her to lie about having seen him on the night of the murder, and evidence that defendant was upset with the victim because her romantic relationship with his son had soured and because defendant had witnessed her cheating on his son.

       </p>

        In a murder case, the forensic evidence, when taken as a whole, was sufficient for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant was the perpetrator. Defendant's DNA was found in the victim's mouth and vagina; no one else's DNA was found inside the victim; there was additional chemical evidence in the victim's mouth and vagina that an expert testified likely came from semen; and two pubic hairs matching defendant's mitochondrial DNA profile were found at the scene. State v. Brochu, 183 Vt. 269, 949 A.2d 1035 (Mar. 7, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's motion for a judgment of acquittal aiding in aggravated murder was properly denied where there was ample evidence in this case to establish defendant's guilt. State v. Perez, 180 Vt. 388, 912 A.2d 944.
       </p>
       <p>
        To establish defendant's guilt of aiding in aggravated murder of two victims, the State needed to prove that defendant aided his accomplice in the commission of each murder and had the requisite intent with respect to each murder. State v. Perez, 180 Vt. 388, 912 A.2d 944.
       </p>
       <p>
        State's case was sufficient to demonstrate a prima facie case of murder and thus withstand defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal, where prosecution offered circumstantial evidence to show that defendant shot victim and that suicide was improbable, and direct testimonial evidence that defendant admitted he was "going to shoot someone" and confessed after victim's death that he had "popped him." State v. Couture, 169 Vt. 222, 734 A.2d 524 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sufficient evidence supported jury finding that defendant convicted of second-degree murder was aware of deadly risk of shaking and covering the mouth of his 20-month old daughter, where defendant admitted this conduct to his wife, who related his statements to jury, and state introduced expert and medical testimony on victim's injuries that confirmed defendant's conduct. State v. Brunell, 159 Vt. 1, 615 A.2d 127 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where on direct examination a witness for state testified that he had been well acquainted with deceased for years, that the latter was an aged man and walked with a cane or crutch, inquiries on cross-examination as to whether witness had drunk intoxicating liquor with deceased, whether witness had ever seen deceased under the influence of liquor, and as to deceased's conduct in that condition, were properly excluded as not proper cross-examination. State v. Lescord, 96 Vt. 85, 117 A. 242 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        When on the trial of one charged with crime his flight is shown as tending to prove guilt, it is proper to show the extent of the flight and such actions and doings of the respondent, when pursued, including resistance of known officers in attempting his arrest, as tend to characterize the flight. State v. Shaw, 73 Vt. 149, 50 A. 863 (1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where child died from a fractured skull it was proper to permit the state to show that an infant's skull could be fractured by pressure of the hands, as tending to show that respondents had the means and physical ability to perpetrate the crime.

       <p>
        13 V.S.A.
        §
        2301 increases the punishment for felony murders that otherwise might have been only second-degree murders because of the absence of an intent to kill. State v. Bacon, 163 Vt. 279, 658 A.2d 54, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 837, 116 S. Ct. 117, 133 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Felony murder in Vermont does not presume liability for all fatal consequences stemming from the underlying felony; rather, only murderous consequences are punished. State v. Bacon, 163 Vt. 279, 658 A.2d 54, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 837, 116 S. Ct. 117, 133 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mere showing that a person intended to commit one of the felonies enumerated in 13 V.S.A.
        §
        2301 is insufficient to convict the person of felony murder; at minimum, the prosecution must show a mental state of wanton disregard for human life with respect to the murder itself. State v. Bacon, 163 Vt. 279, 658 A.2d 54, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 837, 116 S. Ct. 117, 133 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        To convict a defendant as an accomplice to felony murder, prosecutor must prove that
    defendant possessed both the intent to commit the underlying felony as well as one of the three mental states required to convict principal perpetrator of felony murder. State v. Bacon, 163 Vt. 279, 658 A.2d 54, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 837, 116 S. Ct. 117, 133 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the State must prove the requisite intent of each participant in a felony murder with regard to the murder as well as the underlying felony, the jury may infer such intent from circumstantial evidence; the instructions should have said as much, but they did not. State v. Bacon, 163 Vt. 279, 658 A.2d 54, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 837, 116 S. Ct. 117, 133 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        If defendant acted with, at minimum, extreme indifference to the value of human life, the mental element of felony murder would be satisfied. State v. Bacon, 163 Vt. 279, 658 A.2d 54, cert. denied, 516 U.S. 837, 116 S. Ct. 117, 133 L. Ed. 2d 67 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where felony murder was alleged in the information to have occurred in the course of a robbery, it was not necessary to separately allege the assault element of robbery in the information in order to reasonably indicate the exact offense charged. State v. Wright, 154 Vt. 512, 581 A.2d 720 (1989), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1032, 111 S. Ct. 692, 112 L. Ed. 2d 682 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        To convict a person of felony murder, the jury must find, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the killing was done with malice during the perpetration or attempted perpetration of one of five enumerated felonies. State v. Doucette, 143 Vt. 573, 470 A.2d 676 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        To find malice to convict a person of felony murder a jury may take into consideration the nature of the felony and the facts and circumstances surrounding the killing and the commission of the felony, but may not find malice merely from an intent commit the underlying felony. State v. Doucette, 143 Vt. 573, 470 A.2d 676 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Before the felony murder rule becomes applicable to a homicide, the prosecution must show that the killing was committed with malice; the rule does not apply if the killing was done accidentally or unintentionally. State v. Doucette, 143 Vt. 573, 470 A.2d 676 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Premeditation is not a required element of felony murder. State v. Doucette, 143 Vt. 573, 470 A.2d 676 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the case of defendant convicted of felony murder, where the trial judge properly instructed the jury that in order to convict defendant of felony murder it first had to find that state proved murder beyond a reasonable doubt and explained that it must find malice in order to find murder, the state produced evidence that the defendant killed the victim while perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate a robbery and that the victim was killed by two or three bullets shot at close range into the back of the head, since this type of killing clearly supported a finding of intent to kill or do great bodily harm, or of wanton disregard of causing death or great bodily harm by one's behavior, the conviction would be affirmed. State v. Doucette, 143 Vt. 573, 470 A.2d 676 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The felony-murder rule operates as a conclusive presumption automatically imputing the necessary elements of first degree murder. State v. Battick, 133 Vt. 558, 349 A.2d 221 (1975).

       <p>
        An indictment charging that defendant did willfully, deliberately, and of malice aforethought beat, kill, and murder, did not charge first-degree murder, rather the lack of the term "premeditated" made the indictment into one for murder in the second degree.

         19. Lesser-included offenses.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Since second-degree murder is a lesser-included offense of first-degree murder, the jury could have convicted defendant of second-degree "wanton disregard" murder even if the State had charged him only with "willful, deliberate and premeditated" first-degree murder, despite the fact that the two charges are predicated on different mental states. There was no authority for defendant's claim that the State had to specify in the information how it intended to prove intent to kill. State v. Olsen, 165 Vt. 208, 680 A.2d 107 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution for felony murder in which lesser-included offense instructions were given, trial court erred in charging jury with first finding defendant not guilty of the greater charge before it could consider a lesser-included charge and in not instructing jury that, between a greater and a lesser offense (e.g., first degree and second degree murder), the jury must presume defendant guilty of the lesser. State v. Wright, 154 Vt. 512, 581 A.2d 720 (1989), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1032, 111 S. Ct. 692, 112 L. Ed. 2d 682 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        At trial in which the record supported a verdict that defendant was either guilty of felony murder or not guilty of any homicide, but which did not support verdict of any lesser degree of homicide and throughout which defendant consistently maintained his innocence of the homicide and robbery, jury charge which erroneously instructed jury that it must find defendant not guilty of the greater charge before it could consider a lesser-included charge, that "sudden passion or great provocation" constituted essential elements of voluntary manslaughter, and which omitted instruction that, between a greater and a lesser offense, the jury must presume defendant guilty of lesser offense constituted harmless error. State v. Wright, 154 Vt. 512, 581 A.2d 720 (1989), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1032, 111 S. Ct. 692, 112 L. Ed. 2d 682 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jury instruction on voluntary manslaughter which included "sudden passion or great provocation" as an essential element of that offense amounted to plain error. State v. Wright, 154 Vt. 512, 581 A.2d 720 (1989), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1032, 111 S. Ct. 692, 112 L. Ed. 2d 682 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        At trial for felony murder in which instructions were given on lesser-included offenses of second degree murder, voluntary and involuntary manslaughter, issue of court's failure to instruct on diminished capacity was not preserved for review; trial did not revolve around such a defense theory and omission was neither raised squarely on appeal nor timely objected to at trial, and supreme court did not find trial court's failure to instruct so egregious as to amount to plain error. State v. Wright, 154 Vt. 512, 581 A.2d 720 (1989), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1032, 111 S. Ct. 692, 112 L. Ed. 2d 682 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although assault is an essential element of the crime of assault and robbery, trial court's failure to issue separate instruction on assault as an element of robbery at trial for felony murder was not erroneous where the assault amounted to murder, whose elements had been fully explained to jury. State v. Wright, 154 Vt. 512, 581 A.2d 720 (1989), cert. denied, 498 U.S. 1032, 111 S. Ct. 692, 112 L. Ed. 2d 682 (1991).

        Where the circumstances set forth were of a quality above, speculation and conjecture on all elements of charge of murder in the first degree and provided a basis for a finding or legitimate inference that the killing was in fact the result of premeditation and deliberation it was for the jury to construe the evidence and determine its weight.

         22. Jury instructions.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In a prosecution of defendant for aiding in aggravated murder, jury instructions accurately and clearly described the State's burden of proof where they explained the elements of the crime, and stated that to prove defendant's guilt as an accomplice, the State needed to show that defendant and his accomplice acted under a common plan, and where the court then provided an in-depth explanation of what was required to establish a "common plan," including the requirement that defendant share his accomplice's intent to commit all of the legal elements of the offense. State v. Perez, 180 Vt. 388, 912 A.2d 944.
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial courts should refrain from using term "malice aforethought" in jury instructions; rather than describing malice as a requisite element of murder, trial courts should indicate appropriate states of mind required for each type of murder. State v. Johnson, 158 Vt. 508, 615 A.2d 132 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although definition of malice in jury charge on first-degree murder had potential for confusion, viewed in its entirety, charge did not constitute plain error, since court explicitly stated that state must prove each element beyond a reasonable doubt, and that element of premeditation required that defendant actually intend to kill. State v. Johnson, 158 Vt. 508, 615 A.2d 132 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where jury instructions plainly stated different mental elements required for convictions of first-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter, reversal of first-degree murder conviction was not warranted by similarity of language of implied malice instruction and involuntary manslaughter instruction. State v. Johnson, 158 Vt. 508, 615 A.2d 132 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's use of the word "immorality" in jury instruction describing malice did not have any significant impact on the instructions. State v. Brunell, 159 Vt. 1, 615 A.2d 127 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jury instructions requisite states of mind for second-degree murder and involuntary manslaughter, taken as a whole, were not so confused as to amount to plain error; given defense theory that victim died as a result of an injury inflicted, not by defendant, but by a fall the day before death, any shortcomings in the instructions on defendant's mental state were less significant. State v. Brunell, 159 Vt. 1, 615 A.2d 127 (1992).

        Jury could not properly find defendant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of first-degree murder of her husband because only evidence that defendant incited her lover or procured his actions was ambiguous statement that he had to prove himself, state presented no other evidence to warrant inference that defendant intended that her lover prove himself through killing her husband, and although lover told defendant after killing that he had "proven himself," assuming this was a confession, jury could only speculate that he had proven himself through means dictated by defendant.

        Jury could not properly find defendant guilty beyond reasonable doubt of first-degree murder of her husband because although state presented evidence that defendant feared that divorce would deprive her of her house and children, lied about knowing of her husband's insurance, and would have been better off if her husband were dead, evidence may have fairly established motive, but no more.

         1. Purpose.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The purpose of this section was to allow the court to determine if a person who pleads guilty to murder is guilty of first or second degree murder, thus if a person had pleaded to first degree murder, the court could hear testimony to determine whether such person was guilty of second degree murder. In re Murray, 131 Vt. 4, 298 A.2d 835 (1972).

         2. Questions for jury.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        It is for the jury to find from all the evidence whether the killing is murder, and if so, whether in the first or second degree. State v. Carr, 53 Vt. 37 (1880).
       </p>

         3. Charge to jury.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where respondent might have been guilty of murder in the first or second degree or manslaughter it was error for the court, in its charge to the jury, to define two of the crimes without defining the other and the court should have fully explained to the jury what constitutes each degree of murder and its distinguishing characteristics, so that they might have a correct standard by which to determine the degree. State v. Meyer, 58 Vt. 457, 3 A. 195 (1886).
       </p>
       <p>
        Charge to the jury was erroneous where, there being testimony tending to prove a case of manslaughter only, the court neglected to call the jury's attention to it in that light, or to the theory of the respondent's counsel upon the evidence, indicating that it was manslaughter and not murder, and omitted to inform the jury of the distinction between murder and manslaughter, except in a few abstract remarks, unaccompanied by any application of them to the facts in the case. State v. McDonnell, 32 Vt. 491 (1860).

         4. Confessions.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Confession in a legal sense is an admission of something which proves, or tends to prove, that the party making it was himself connected with the alleged crime, in a criminal or questionable manner; hence, admissions which tend to criminate a third party, are not within the rules of law that exclude confessions induced by promises and hope of favor. State v. Carr, 53 Vt. 37 (1880).

         5. Questions for court.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where defendant had pleaded to murder only in the second degree there was no need for the court to take testimony to determine the degree of murder as would have been the case if the defendant had pleaded to first degree murder, or even to murder without specifying the degree. In re Murray, 131 Vt. 4, 298 A.2d 835 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a defendant enters a plea of guilty to a charge of murder in the first degree, it is the duty of the court, before whom the plea is made, to determine the degree of the crime by examination of witnesses, so that the appropriate sentence may be given, depending on its determination of whether murder was in the first or second degree. In re Murphy, 127 Vt. 198, 243 A.2d 788 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant pleaded guilty to a charge of second-degree murder, the trial court was not under a duty to examine witnesses and determine the degree of crime. In re Murphy, 127 Vt. 198, 243 A.2d 788 (1968).

         6. Evidence.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Section contemplates for the purpose of determining the degree of the crime that evidence may be introduced showing the existence of any of the elements specified by reason of which it is murder in the first degree. State v. Goyet, 120 Vt. 12, 132 A.2d 623 (1957), same case (1956) 119 Vt. 167, 122 A.2d 862.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate robbery results in murder in the first degree, proof of robbery only goes to the degree of murder and not to the proof of the criminal means by which it was committed. State v. Goyet, 120 Vt. 12, 132 A.2d 623 (1957), same case (1956) 119 Vt. 167, 122 A.2d 862.
       </p>
       <p>
        State may, under this section, introduce evidence to show that the murder was committed in perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate a robbery. State v. Lescord, 96 Vt. 85, 117 A. 242 (1922).

       <p>
        Prior decision holding that the statute setting forth penalties for first-degree and second-degree murder was unconstitutional because it allowed the trial court, rather than a jury, to find facts that increased the penalty for first-degree murder beyond the statutory maximum did not apply where defendant was neither convicted nor sentenced for second-degree murder, but, instead, was sentenced for the two crimes to which he pled guilty - voluntary manslaughter and first-degree aggravated domestic assault - and the sentences that he received did not exceed the statutory maximums for these crimes. State v. King, 179 Vt. 400, 897 A.2d 543 (February 24, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Constitutional provision barring legislature from commuting, remitting, or mitigating sentences of individual felons did not prohibit legislature from striking words "in the state prison" from penalties for first degree murder, for legislature's power to enact laws was unaffected. Rebideau v. Moeykens, 132 Vt. 49, 312 A.2d 926 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Constitutional provision dealing with accused's right to waive jury trial did not bar state from striking words "in the state prison" from penalties for first degree murder, for the provision was inapplicable. Rebideau v. Moeykens, 132 Vt. 49, 312 A.2d 926 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Contention that state legislature created an ex post facto law by striking words "in the state prison" from this section and in their place authorizing commissioner of corrections to designate place of confinement, would be dismissed, for amendment did not create a new offense or aggravate or increase the enormity of, or punishment for, the crime of which accused was convicted. Rebideau v. Moeykens, 132 Vt. 49, 312 A.2d 926 (1973).

        Where amendment to this section had become effective before commission of first degree murder by petitioner, his contention that amendment was ex post facto law as to him was without merit. Rebideau v. Moeykens, 132 Vt. 49, 312 A.2d 926 (1973).

       <p>
        Former amendment which provided that punishment for murder in the first degree shall be death or imprisonment in the state's prison for life, "as the jury may determine," does not divide murder in the first degree into grades, but leaves it for the jury to determine the penalty, in the untrammeled exercise of a just and wise discretion, without any instructions as to the doctrine of reasonable doubt, presumptions, etc. State v. Bosworth, 86 Vt. 71, 83 A. 657 (1912).

        Jury has no right to consider in its deliberations the different punishments for murder in the first degree and murder in the second degree, but is to consider the case solely upon the facts in determining whether it is murder in the first or second degree.

         5. Aggravating factors.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        While the presence of a mitigating factor might have enabled the court to depart from the presumptive minimum sentence, it did not require such a departure. Thus, even removing aggravating factors from the equation, the court's decision to impose the statutory minimum did not prejudice defendant's substantial rights, and any error in considering the aggravating factors was harmless beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Baird, 180 Vt. 243, 908 A.2d 475 (August 25, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant failed in her argument that the court improperly treated her failure to accept responsibility at sentencing as a "surrogate for maintaining her innocence through trial and sentencing" where the court properly limited its consideration of her failure to accept responsibility to her denial at the time of sentencing and to the impact of her denial on the core sentencing goals of rehabilitation and protection of the public. State v. Baird, 180 Vt. 243, 908 A.2d 475 (August 25, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant failed in his claim that the trial court violated the Vermont and United States Constitutions by enhancing his sentence based on the court's findings of certain aggravating factors because he offered no basis to conclude that there would have been a different result had the jury been required to find the aggravating factors. State v. Stevens, 175 Vt. 503, 825 A.2d 8 (mem.) (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the trial court finds that the aggravating factors outweigh any mitigating factors, the court has discretion to set the minimum term of incarceration as high as life without parole. State v. White, 172 Vt. 493, 782 A.2d 1187 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Aggravating factor that murder was committed while defendant was engaged in the commission of, or attempted commission of, a felony was shown by evidence that there was a taking of money, or an attempted taking of money, from the victim or in her presence, constituting an assault and robbery. State v. White, 172 Vt. 493, 782 A.2d 1187 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Aggravating factor that the victim was particularly vulnerable was shown by fact that she was working alone at night, a fact known to defendant, and, because the victim knew defendant, it was less likely she would call the police when he arrived. State v. White, 172 Vt. 493, 782 A.2d 1187 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Aggravating factor that murder was particularly severe, brutal, or cruel was shown by the extent of the injuries to the victim both as a result of the strangulation and from the subsequent mutilation of the body by acid and other chemicals and the attempt to burn the body. State v. White, 172 Vt. 493, 782 A.2d 1187 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        In finding aggravating factor that murder was random, predatory, or arbitrary in nature, the trial court relied upon a definition of predatory which portrayed such activities as "marked by a tendency to victimize or destroy others for one's own benefit." State v. White, 172 Vt. 493, 782 A.2d 1187 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        In finding aggravating factor based on the state's proposition that "[d]efendant is aware of his strength and is willing to use it against women, regardless of the circumstances," the trial court referred to evidence that defendant had previously pushed his mother-in-law against a wall and choked her, and that he had choked another woman while engaging in sexual intercourse with her. State v. White, 172 Vt. 493, 782 A.2d 1187 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no error at defendant's sentencing for felony murder, where court properly examined all statutory factors and concluded that all but one aggravating factor was present while no mitigating factors were, and only then did court mention victim's standing in community; these considerations provided an independent basis for sentencing decision, and therefore any error in trial court's considering victim's community standing was harmless. State v. Bacon, 169 Vt. 268, 733 A.2d 50 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in finding murder particularly severe, brutal or cruel, where defendant was a trusted friend of victim, defendant repeatedly stabbed victim after he had inflicted fatal wound to her carotid artery, and several stab wounds were to victim's hands as she raised them up in defense. State v. Corliss, 168 Vt. 333, 721 A.2d 438 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for murder, the court did not err in finding as an aggravating factor that the murder was committed while defendant was "in custody under sentence of imprisonment" although he was an escaped prisoner. Section 2303(d)(1) is intended as an additional deterrent to homicide by persons less likely to be deterred by the prospect of further confinement and applies not only to prisoners committing murder within the confines of prison walls, but applies with equal if not greater force to escapees, who face an even longer term of imprisonment after apprehension and whose conduct demonstrates the need for greater deterrence. State v. Gundlah, 166 Vt. 518, 702 A.2d 52 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        13 V.S.A.
        §
        2303(d)(4), which specifies as an aggravating factor in determination of penalties for murder that victim was particularly weak, vulnerable, or helpless, does not limit the term "vulnerability"; section 2303(d)(4) permits the trial court to use its discretion to determine whether, under the particular facts of the case and based on the evidence, the victim was particularly vulnerable. State v. Kelley, 163 Vt. 325, 664 A.2d 708 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is nothing illogical or contrary to the plain language of 13 V.S.A.
        §
        2303(d)(4),
    which specifies as an aggravating factor in determination of penalties for murder that victim was particularly weak, vulnerable, or helpless, to characterize as vulnerable a person sitting alone in his car on the side of the road with a gun pointed to his head. State v. Kelley, 163 Vt. 325, 664 A.2d 708 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Finding that murder defendant acted to produce a deadly confrontation was properly used as an aggravating factor in defendant's sentencing. State v. Verrinder, 161 Vt. 250, 637 A.2d 1382 (1993).

       <p>
        In an appeal from first-degree murder conviction, the supreme court has no discretionary power to allow bail under the provisions of
        §
        7556 of this title, despite respondent's contention that he was not committed for a capital offense under the penalties provided for homicide by this section and since judgment and sentence had been stayed he was not "in execution"; such power being confined to the judge or judges of the court where the appellant was convicted.

         7. Presentence investigation reports.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Defendant did not make a plausible showing that information in other individuals' presentence investigation reports (PSIs) was material to his sentencing: He did not claim that the requested PSIs contained information concerning his culpability or aggravating and mitigating factors, but sought only to compare himself with other individuals who had been sentenced to life-without-parole. Even if it was assumed that the PSIs would have shown that these other individuals were more culpable and dangerous than defendant, that information would not have been material to his sentence, as sentencing in Vermont is individualized, with broad discretion afforded the trial court in fashioning an appropriate sentence, which may involve a wide-ranging inquiry into a defendant's life and the nature of the offense committed.

         11. Procedure.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Provost, which held that any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt, is not an extraordinary case requiring full retroactive application. It concerns only procedural questions: who determines sentence-enhancing factors and under what standard of proof. State v. White, 182 Vt. 510, 944 A.2d 203 (Nov. 9, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Neither the accuracy nor the fundamental fairness of defendants' convictions was brought into question by the constitutional concerns raised in the Provost decision, which held that any fact that increased the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum had be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt. Therefore, Provost did not have to be applied retroactively to defendants' cases despite their finality. State v. White, 182 Vt. 510, 944 A.2d 203 (Nov. 9, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Rule announced in Provost that any fact that increases the penalty for a crime beyond the prescribed statutory maximum must be submitted to a jury and proved beyond a reasonable doubt is not a watershed rule of criminal procedure, and as such, fails to meet the standard for an exception to the common-law rule that new constitutional rules of criminal procedure apply retroactively only to cases on direct review. State v. White, 182 Vt. 510, 944 A.2d 203 (Nov. 9, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, after the jury convicted appellant of first-degree murder, the district court conducted a weighing of aggravating and mitigating factors pursuant to this section and found multiple aggravating factors, including the "particularly brutal and cruel" nature of the murder, and no significant mitigating factors, and, further, the court found that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors and sentenced appellant to a term of life in prison without the possibility of parole, the court's use of this sentencing procedure was error, and the error is obvious. State v. Yoh, 180 Vt. 317, 910 A.2d 853 (June 30, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the sentencing judge is required by this section to weigh any aggravating factors against the applicable mitigating factors in subsec. (e), even a sentence based on aggravating factors admitted by defendant or implied by the jury's verdict would violate the Sixth Amendment. Under those circumstances, while the Sixth Amendment would not require the jury to find the aggravating factors, it would require the jury to determine whether those factors outweighed any mitigating factors. Thus, the sentencing error caused by the court's finding that the aggravating factors outweighed the mitigating factors affected the outcome of the trial court proceedings and satisfied the prejudice requirement of the plain-error test. State v. Yoh, 180 Vt. 317, 910 A.2d 853 (June 30, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant argued that the district court misbalanced the statutory aggravating and mitigating factors in light of the relevant facts when it decided to give her the presumptive sentence instead of a lesser sentence, she waived any claim of error based on the prior decision holding the sentencing statute unconstitutional because it required the court to weigh aggravating and mitigating factors not found by a jury in deciding whether to give a sentence greater than the presumptive sentence set forth in the statute. State v. Baird, 180 Vt. 243, 908 A.2d 475 (August 25, 2006).

         1. Constitutionality.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Unlawful-act manslaughter predicated on reckless endangerment was not unconstitutionally vague when applied to facts of case because recognition of duty to disclose material defects to buyers predated sale of defendant's home and evidence indicated, and jury found, that defendant's failure to warn buyers of driveway heater's dangerous condition amounted to reckless endangerment because defendant knew that the heater was not repaired when he sold the home. State v. Brooks, 163 Vt. 245, 658 A.2d 22 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although supreme court could not specify every set of facts which constitute reckless conduct, the recklessness standard on which involuntary manslaughter is predicated is sufficiently precise to prevent it from being arbitrarily applied; scope of conduct which may be deemed reckless is sufficiently narrowed by the requirement that the risk, when objectively viewed, amounts to a gross deviation from the standard of conduct that a law-abiding person would observe in the actor's situation. State v. Brooks, 163 Vt. 245, 658 A.2d 22 (1995).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Reckless endangerment is not a lesser-included offense of common law manslaughter since the unlawful act necessary to sustain a conviction for manslaughter could be reckless or negligent, and, therefore, the offense of reckless endangerment has an element not necessarily included in the offense of manslaughter. State v. Forbes, 147 Vt. 612, 523 A.2d 1232 (1987).

         7. Elements.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Any act undertaken by a defendant in a criminally negligent fashion that results in the death of another may subject the defendant to criminal liability for involuntary manslaughter, and it is unnecessary to consider whether the act is independently unlawful. State v. Viens, 186 Vt. 138, 978 A.2d 37 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Involuntary manslaughter may be divided into two separate types, which may be labeled (1) "criminal-negligence" manslaughter and (2) "unlawful-act" manslaughter; the trend today is to abolish unlawful-act manslaughter, leaving the field of involuntary manslaughter occupied only by the criminal-negligence type. In the context of involuntary manslaughter, a defendant's criminal liability does not hinge on whether his otherwise blameworthy act can be described as violating a common law or statutory offense. State v. Viens, 186 Vt. 138, 978 A.2d 37 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Crime of involuntary manslaughter does not include, as an element, an independently unlawful act. It follows, therefore, that the State need not introduce evidence regarding a nonexistent element. State v. Viens, 186 Vt. 138, 978 A.2d 37 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that other hunters might engage in potentially criminally negligent behavior in other contexts did not mean that the jury could not find that defendant's actions were a gross deviation from the conduct expected of a reasonable person. State v. Viens, 186 Vt. 138, 978 A.2d 37 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Independently unlawful act is not an element of the crime of involuntary manslaughter; therefore, it need not be set forth in the information. State v. Viens, 186 Vt. 138, 978 A.2d 37 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        The minimum standard of culpability under this section is criminal negligence; defendant must have disregarded a risk of death or injury of such a nature and degree that his failure to perceive it, considering the nature and purpose of his conduct and the circumstances known to him, involves a gross deviation from the standard of care that a reasonable person would observe in the actor's situation. State v. Stanislaw, 153 Vt. 517, 573 A.2d 286 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Information adequately charged offense of involuntary manslaughter where it specifically alleged defendant caused the death of victim by committing the unlawful act of furnishing alcohol to a minor, and detailed affidavit of probable cause accompanying information reasonably indicated the illegal act giving rise to exact offense charged. State v. Stanislaw, 153 Vt. 517, 573 A.2d 286 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Involuntary manslaughter is defined as a killing caused by an unlawful act, but not accompanied with any intention to take life. State v. Poirier, 142 Vt. 595, 458 A.2d 1109 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since an essential element of the crime of driving under the influence with a fatal accident resulting under section 1210 of Title 23 is that the defendant be under the influence of intoxicating liquor, while the crime of manslaughter does not require this element, trial court did not err in denying motion of defendant, charged with both crimes, to require the state to elect between the charges, although the same act gave rise to each. State v. Poirier, 142 Vt. 595, 458 A.2d 1109 (1983).

        At trial for involuntary manslaughter, state's burden of proof was discharged on showing that defendant was the natural mother of infant victim, that circumstances indicated a need for medical treatment for the welfare of the infant, that defendant had the means and capacity to secure such attention, and that defendant failed in providing the necessary care.

         9. Instructions.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Defendant, who was convicted of the second-degree murder of his son's close friend, was not entitled to an instruction on voluntary manslaughter as a lesser included offense. There was no adequate provocation or actual provocation by the victim; even if defendant were actually provoked by his son's statement that he intended to join the armed services like the victim, defendant's attack was on a person sitting in a car who had not said anything to defendant or provoked him in any way, and the only physical altercations did not involve the victim. State v. Kulzer, 186 Vt. 264, 979 A.2d 1031 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's instructions regarding the elements of involuntary manslaughter accurately characterized the state of Vermont law when the trial court explained that the jury had to find that defendant engaged in a level of conduct that met the criminal negligence standard and caused the victim's death; the trial court set forth a sufficient description of causation, and, crucially, it accurately described criminal negligence. Therefore, the decision of the court to refuse to require the jury to find an independent unlawful act in no way undermined the court's confidence in the verdict. State v. Viens, 186 Vt. 138, 978 A.2d 37 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        In light of the trial court's general and specific instructions regarding juror unanimity that clearly required the jury to agree on a specific set of acts amounting to criminal negligence, the court could not say that the court committed error, let alone plain error, in giving instructions on involuntary manslaughter. State v. Viens, 186 Vt. 138, 978 A.2d 37 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although involuntary manslaughter defendant argued that instruction defining recklessness was flawed because it incorporated both the criminal negligence and recklessness standards but did not distinguish between the two, contrary to defendant's suggestion, both recklessness and criminal negligence require an objective view of risk; the difference is one of degree. State v. Brooks, 163 Vt. 245, 658 A.2d 22 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court properly instructed the jury to objectively assess the risk and to determine whether involuntary manslaughter defendant consciously disregarded that risk; for further clarification, it referred the jury to the reckless endangerment instruction, which expressly required a finding that defendant actually knew from the circumstances then existing that the heater had not properly been repaired. State v. Brooks, 163 Vt. 245, 658 A.2d 22 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        If there was any flaw in jury instruction in involuntary manslaughter prosecution, it stemmed from the court's use of the term "reasonable-person" instead of "law-abiding person" when describing the standard for objectively assessing the nature of the risk; this does not amount to plain error. State v. Brooks, 163 Vt. 245, 658 A.2d 22 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although involuntary manslaughter defendant challenged as erroneous the court's instruction that the vendor of real estate has a legal duty to disclose undiscoverable material defects to the buyer, arguing that he had no such legal duty, because the case establishing this duty was decided after he sold his home in 1988, a duty to speak had been recognized in the context of real estate transactions before defendant sold his home so that instruction was an accurate statement of existing law. State v. Brooks, 163 Vt. 245, 658 A.2d 22 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although involuntary manslaughter defendant challenged as erroneous the court's instruction that the vendor of real estate has a legal duty to disclose undiscoverable material defects to the buyer, arguing that instruction amounted to a directed verdict because the jury was not instructed that it must determine whether defendant had a duty to disclose the defect and instruction did not remind jury of state's burden to prove existence of duty beyond a reasonable doubt, instruction did not amount to directed verdict since the court did not tell the jury that defendant had a duty to plaintiff but, rather, stated the law regarding the duty to disclose and instructed the jury to apply the facts to the law, and the court also expressly and repeatedly informed the jury of the state's burden in making the charge as a whole so that there was no need to repeat the state's burden after each issue or element. State v. Brooks, 163 Vt. 245, 658 A.2d 22 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although involuntary manslaughter defendant contended that instruction should have explicitly precluded criminal liability if the jury found that either defendant did not know the heater was not working or reasonably believed that the buyers would discover the defect, the instructions gave the jury ample opportunity to consider defendant's primary defense because, although not articulated as a fact precluding liability, separate instructions on recklessness and intervening causation required the jury to determine, beyond a reasonable doubt, whether defendant actually knew the heater was not fixed at the time of sale. State v. Brooks, 163 Vt. 245, 658 A.2d 22 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although involuntary manslaughter defendant contended that evidence that others negligently failed to repair defective heater and that the professional inspector failed to discover the flaw was presented, and therefore, warranted an explicit instruction on intervening cause, instruction directing jury to consider acts or omissions of others as potential intervening cause was accurate statement of law even though it was not articulation defendant would have preferred. State v. Brooks, 163 Vt. 245, 658 A.2d 22 (1995).

         10. Evidence.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In an involuntary manslaughter case, ample evidence supported the jury's finding of criminal negligence. Defendant invited others, whom he did not know to be good shooters, onto his property to shoot powerful rifles completely unsuited to the setting. State v. McCarthy, 191 Vt. 498, 48 A.3d 616 (May 4, 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was sufficient evidence of causation in an involuntary manslaughter case where defendant set up a shooting range on his property, resulting in the death of a neighbor struck by a stray bullet. Although defendant might not have fired the fatal bullet, his actions set in motion a natural and continuous sequence, unbroken by any efficient intervening cause, culminating in the victim's death. State v. McCarthy, 191 Vt. 498, 48 A.3d 616 (May 4, 2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was sufficient evidence of the criminal negligence needed to prove involuntary manslaughter when the State introduced testimony that defendant, who had shouldered his high-powered hunting rifle, disengaged its safety, and proceeded to view his surroundings through the rifle's scope with his finger on or near the trigger, had violated numerous hunter and gun safety guidelines. The State was not required to prove that defendant intentionally fired his rifle to demonstrate criminal negligence. State v. Viens, 186 Vt. 138, 978 A.2d 37 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        When defendant was charged with murdering her husband, the evidence did not clearly support a voluntary manslaughter charge. Evidence at trial suggesting that defendant put sleeping pills into her husband's coffee several hours before the attack cast doubt on whether defendant did not have time to cool off or did not actually cool off; defendant did not point to any confrontation between herself and her husband; and she did not argue that her capacity was diminished at the time of the offense. State v. Schreiner, 183 Vt. 42, 944 A.2d 250 (Dec. 14, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was sufficient evidence to prove that involuntary manslaughter defendant knew that driveway heating unit had not been repaired when he sold his home to victims where plumbing company employee testified that one month after earlier accident with driveway heating unit defendant told him that it had still not been repaired, defendant spoke with a carpenter about fixing problem with heater but carpenter declined, and there was no evidence that plumbing company or carpenter worked on heater while home was on market. State v. Brooks, 163 Vt. 245, 658 A.2d 22 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was sufficient evidence that involuntary manslaughter defendant breached his legal duty to disclose driveway heater's defect where defendant knew that the heater could emit noxious fumes into home, if unattended, and that it was unrepaired when home was on the market, and defendant accompanied one of victims and the home inspector on their tours of the home and demonstrated the heater, but did not mention its history. State v. Brooks, 163 Vt. 245, 658 A.2d 22 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although involuntary manslaughter defendant suggested that his continued use of defective driveway heater during the winter of 1987 was persuasive evidence, rising to the level of reasonable doubt, that he thought the heater was repaired or that he was unaware of the substantial risk, the jury could reasonably have inferred that, because defendant understood the exact nature of the problem, he ran the heater only for brief periods to prevent exhaust back-up and additional evidence that defendant checked the exhaust cylinders before and after using the heater reasonably implied that defendant was himself wary of using the machine. State v. Brooks, 163 Vt. 245, 658 A.2d 22 (1995).

         1. Self-defense.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Doctrine of self-defense provides that defendant who kills or wounds another in just and necessary defense of his own life shall be guiltless; "just and necessary" being when defendant's belief of imminent peril and of need to repel that peril with deadly force is reasonable. State v. Wheelock, 158 Vt. 302, 609 A.2d 972 (1992), overruled in part by State v. Congress, 2014 Vt. LEXIS 135 (Vt. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the case of defendant charged with two counts of simple assault, the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal, which was based on a claim that he had acted in self-defense, and was, therefore, guiltless under subsec. (1) of this section, where the evidence indicated that the defendant had not been justified in taking action against the victims, three unarmed men who were passing behind his house at the time of the assaults, even though he earlier had received an anonymous phone call threatening his life and had a verbal confrontation with one of the victims several days prior to the incident, since there had been nothing about their behavior that night which would suggest the defendant was under any immediate and unavoidable danger, and since the state had introduced evidence that fairly and reasonably tended to show that the defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Darling, 141 Vt. 358, 449 A.2d 928 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Doctrine of self-defense has no application to resistance of a lawful arrest properly attempted. State v. Shaw, 73 Vt. 149, 50 A. 863 (1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where one sees another coming towards him in a hostile attitude, and the circumstances are such as to reasonably lead him to believe that he is in danger of being killed or of great bodily harm, and he so believes, and through nervousness, fear, fright or cowardice fatally shoots his assailant, it reasonably appearing to him that he can defend himself in no other way, the homicide is justifiable as in self-defense. State v. Doherty, 72 Vt. 381, 48 A. 658 (1900), appeal dismissed, 189 U.S. 514, 23 S. Ct. 850, 47 L. Ed. 925 (1903).

        Defendant was not entitled to jury instruction on justifiable homicide, where there was no evidence of force or violence on victim's part until he was attacked by defendant. State v. Little, 167 Vt. 577, 705 A.2d 177 (mem.) (1997).

        Murder defendant was not entitled to jury instruction on doctrine of imperfect self-defense, under which charge of murder could be reduced to manslaughter if defendant had an honest but unreasonable belief that he faced immediate and grave physical danger and that he had to use deadly force to prevent danger; doctrine was not a recognized part of Vermont's common law of homicide, submission of such an instruction to jury was not required as a matter of basic justice and equity, and defendant's theory of defense - that he was not guilty by reason of self-defense, or guilty of a homicide no more serious than manslaughter - was adequately placed before jury. State v. Shaw, 168 Vt. 412, 721 A.2d 486 (1998), overruled in part by State v. Congress, 2014 Vt. LEXIS 135 (Vt. 2014).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Under the law in effect at the time the defendant was charged with murder in the first degree, if he had pleaded not guilty and subjected himself to trial, the jury, depending upon the evidence, could have found him guilty of murder in either the first or second degree or of voluntary or involuntary manslaughter as the charge of the greater offense includes the lesser offense as well. In re Murray, 131 Vt. 4, 298 A.2d 835 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Both voluntary and involuntary manslaughter are included in the crime of murder, and on a plea of not guilty to an indictment charging that respondent "with force and arms, feloniously, willfully, deliberately, with premeditation, and with malice aforethought, did kill and murder" the deceased, alleging neither the manner nor the means, he may be convicted of involuntary manslaughter. State v. Averill, 85 Vt. 115, 81 A. 461 (1911); State v. Wood, 53 Vt. 560 (1881).

         2. Charge to jury.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The court's decision, in a prosecution for first-degree murder, to submit a reduced charge of second-degree murder to the jury was within its authority and did not violate the double jeopardy clause. A defendant charged with first-degree murder may be convicted of the lesser-included offenses of second-degree murder or manslaughter. A court may thus submit to the jury the lesser offense if it determines that the evidence is insufficient to establish an element of the greater offense. State v. Hatcher, 167 Vt. 338, 706 A.2d 429 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Error, if any, in instructing jury that, if respondent had requisite mental capacity, there was no evidence that would justify his conduct in going to farm where wife was and shooting her, "so as to under any possibility reduce the crime to manslaughter," was cured by verdict of murder in first degree. State v. Stacy, 104 Vt. 379, 160 A. 257 (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where respondent could have been guilty of murder in the first or second degree, or manslaughter it was error for the court, in its charge to the jury, to define two of the crimes without defining the other; it was error for the court to express its opinion that, if the respondent was guilty, he was guilty of murder in the first degree; the court should have fully explained to the jury what constituted each degree of murder and its distinguishing characteristics, so that they might have a correct standard by which to determine the degree. State v. Meyer, 58 Vt. 457, 3 A. 195 (1886).

       <p>
        Fact that defendant's conduct was punishable under either the aggravated murder statute or under the first-degree murder statute, which contained different penalties, did not violate equal protection under the Fourteenth Amendment. Because the circumstances were indistinguishable from those in the United States Supreme Court's decision of Batchelder, the broad holding of Batchelder foreclosed defendant's requested relief under the Fourteenth Amendment. State v. Rooney, 189 Vt. 306, 19 A.3d 92 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Aggravated murder statute and the first-degree murder statute themselves do not treat any particular individuals or classes of individuals differently; all are equally subject to the same legislatively conferred prosecutorial discretion to proceed under either statute as the circumstances may seem to justify in a given case. Defendants accused of murder during the course of a sexual assault are nowhere deemed or recognized as a protected class, and the risk that one prosecutor may pursue a mandatory life sentence while another may file for a more discretionary sentence in the event of different homicides arising from sexual assault is of no constitutional concern unless the choice results from impermissible racial, ethnic or gender biases. State v. Rooney, 189 Vt. 306, 19 A.3d 92 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Authority to charge aggravated murder, rather than felony murder, was of no more practical concern than the unfettered and broad discretion exercised daily by Vermont prosecutors. Certainly, on the record of this case, which failed to reflect any discriminatory treatment, it was of no constitutional concern either. State v. Rooney, 189 Vt. 306, 19 A.3d 92 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the case of murder committed during a sexual assault, the Legislature has determined to leave to the prosecutor the discretion to seek a mandatory life sentence. To the extent that the resulting law permits the prosecutor to effectively circumscribe the trial court's discretion in determining the length of a defendant's sentence, there is no constitutional violation. State v. Rooney, 189 Vt. 306, 19 A.3d 92 (2011).

        .
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where defendant was convicted of both aggravated murder and aggravated sexual assault, his sentence for aggravated sexual assault was impermissible under the Double Jeopardy Clause; serious bodily injury is always proved by proof of death and therefore aggravated sexual assault was a lesser-included offense of aggravated murder, since the lesser offense required no proof beyond that required of the greater offense. State v. Grega, 168 Vt. 363, 721 A.2d 445 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Multiple convictions cannot stand to provide a backup conviction in event that conviction on greater offense is reversed, and therefore murder defendant's conviction for aggravated sexual assault was vacated. State v. Grega, 168 Vt. 363, 721 A.2d 445 (1998).

        There is nothing on the face of the aggravated-murder statute or in the circumstances surrounding its enactment that evinces a clear and manifest intent to replace the first-degree murder statute. State v. Rooney, 189 Vt. 306, 19 A.3d 92 (2011).

         4. Evidence.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction of aggravated murder for the deaths of her ex-fiance and his son, given defendant's repeated confessions to a friend, her sister, and police, her opportunity and motive stemming from her and her ex-fiance's failed relationship, his relationship with a neighbor, and his having beaten her, and the forensic evidence tying her to the murder weapon, to which she had access and with which she was familiar. State v. O'Neill, 209 Vt. 599, 209 A.3d 1213 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to find defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of aggravated murder, as any inferences made by the jury were reasonable and sufficiently based upon the evidence provided at trial. The State presented DNA evidence that the semen found in the victim's vagina belonged to defendant, and defendant confessed to having penetrated the victim; the State's medical examiner testified that the large amount of semen present in the victim's vagina, as well as the presence and timing of injuries to her vagina, suggested that defendant's semen was deposited in her at around the same time as the murder; and another witness for the State similarly testified that, given the injuries to the victim's vagina, her pants being off-center, and her underwear being stretched out and having leaves in it, it was his conclusion that the victim was raped and that it happened in the woods at or around the same time as the murder. State v. Godfrey, 187 Vt. 495, 996 A.2d 237 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to show that a murder was committed in perpetrating or attempting to perpetrate sexual assault or aggravated sexual assault. There was evidence of a sexual act from defendant's DNA in the victim's mouth and vagina, the absence of anyone else's DNA inside the victim, and the lack of any evidence that defendant had sexual relations with the victim at any other time; furthermore, lack of consent was indicated by the extensive evidence of violence, including the sexual mutilation of the victim, the positioning of her body, and defendant's denial of any consensual activity at any time with the victim. State v. Brochu, 183 Vt. 269, 949 A.2d 1035 (Mar. 7, 2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        To establish defendant's guilt of aiding in aggravated murder of two victims, the State needed to prove that defendant aided his accomplice in the commission of each murder and had the requisite intent with respect to each murder. State v. Perez, 180 Vt. 388, 912 A.2d 944.

       <p>
        In a prosecution of defendant for aiding in aggravated murder, jury instructions accurately and clearly described the State's burden of proof where they explained the elements of the crime, and stated that to prove defendant's guilt as an accomplice, the State needed to show that defendant and his accomplice acted under a common plan, and where the court then provided an in-depth explanation of what was required to establish a "common plan," including the requirement that defendant share his accomplice's intent to commit all of the legal elements of the offense.

        Where the victim was seized and held for two to three minutes by defendant's accomplice during an attempt to escape from a correctional facility, based upon the qualitative factors surrounding the restraint, the period of confinement was "substantial" enough to support a kidnapping conviction.

        Defendant was properly convicted of kidnapping in connection with domestic disturbance involving his girlfriend and their infant daughter, as court at bench trial properly determined that "without consent" element of restraint was accomplished by force and threat; "restraint" was not based on time defendant physically held baby but on period when he forcibly detained child to keep police at bay, and although defendant's threats and use of force were not directed at child, nothing in statute required that threats be directed at or understood by victim, and victim was no less restrained when confinement was accomplished by threats against another.

       <p>
        Where defendant, charged with attempted kidnapping, opted not to raise the defense of "voluntary release", and none could be raised in view of the fact that the victim escaped from defendant's restraint, as a result, defendant was not eligible for the lesser sentence because he was convicted of crime charged and mitigation was not an issue. State v. Alexander, 178 Vt. 482, 871 A.2d 972 (mem.) (February 18, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jury determination was required in order to invoke voluntary release defense of kidnapping statute, and because voluntary release was an affirmative defense, defendant had burden of proof to establish it. State v. Kinney, 171 Vt. 239, 762 A.2d 833 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because kidnapping defendant failed to make any use, at sentencing, of stipulation that he released victim voluntarily and unharmed, there was no error in trial court's failure to consider stipulation. State v. Kinney, 171 Vt. 239, 762 A.2d 833 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        The safe-release defense in subsec. (b) does not unconstitutionally shift the burden of proof to the defendant, for the following reasons: (1) it does not require the defendant to disprove an element of the State's prima facie case, and (2) the Vermont Constitution does not require the Legislature to choose between eliminating an affirmative defense altogether or requiring the State to prove its absence. State v. Davis, 165 Vt. 240, 683 A.2d 1 (1996).

       <p>
        The test to determine whether confinements or movements involved are such that kidnapping may also be charged and prosecuted when an offense separate from kidnapping has occurred, asks whether the confinement, movement, or detention was merely incidental to the accompanying felony or whether it was significant enough, in and of itself, to warrant independent prosecution. State v. Goodhue, 175 Vt. 457, 833 A.2d 861 (2003).
       </p>

       <p>
        Defendant's forcible confinement of the victim for 30 or more minutes during a standoff with the police, and the subsequent movement of the victim at least one block, satisfied the requirements for kidnapping. State v. Washington, 166 Vt. 600, 691 A.2d 583 (mem.) (1997).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Unlawful restraint in the second degree - consisting of the knowing restraint of another person - is included within the proof needed to establish the elements of kidnapping or attempted kidnapping, and therefore is a lesser-included offense of the greater charge. State v. Alexander, 173 Vt. 376, 795 A.2d 1248 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although, the jury was entitled to infer both the intent to restrain and the intent to do serious bodily injury from the same facts, defendant's second intent was not a foregone conclusion, and, because the resolution of the issue was the important difference between two crimes, unlawful restraint and kidnapping, under the circumstances, it was error not to follow the general rule that lesser-included offenses must be charged when raised by the evidence. State v. Alexander, 173 Vt. 376, 795 A.2d 1248 (mem.) (2002).

       </h5>
       <p>
        In regard to the availability of the charge of kidnapping when it is used to perpetrate a sexual assault, the confinement, movement, or detention used to facilitate the sexual assault must be criminally significant in and of itself and not merely incidental to the sexual assault; that is, there must be a separate kidnapping and the restraint must have increased the dangerousness of defendant's actions, further isolated the victim, and increased her vulnerability. State v. Goodhue, 175 Vt. 457, 833 A.2d 861 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        It cannot be assumed that any restraint incident to a sexual assault, however slight, constitutes kidnapping; the focus must be on the quality and nature of the restraint and, in that regard, it is noted that an offense such as rape necessarily contemplates restrictions on the victim's liberty while the crime is being committed. State v. Goodhue, 175 Vt. 457, 833 A.2d 861 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant's movement of the victim from the kitchen to the bathroom floor did not exceed the confinement or removal inherent in the commission of the crime of sexual assault nor increase the danger to the victim over and above the danger presented by the attempted sexual assault, defendant's actions could not, therefore, provide the basis for a kidnapping conviction. State v. Goodhue, 175 Vt. 457, 833 A.2d 861 (2003).

        Defendant's restraint of the victims after he entered their home created a danger independent of the risk posed by burglars entering an occupied home intent on theft. Thus, the burglary was a separate offense from kidnapping, and the motion to dismiss the kidnapping charge was properly denied. State v. Jones, 190 Vt. 586, 44 A.3d 148 (2011).

        In a kidnapping case, the court rejected defendant's pro se statute of limitations argument. A kidnapping prosecution could be commenced at any time after the commission of the offense. State v. Jones, 190 Vt. 586, 44 A.3d 148 (2011).

       <p>
        Where defendant confined complainant for approximately one and one-half hours while alternately fondling and intimidating her, the duration of confinement was well beyond the time required to perpetrate a lewd and lascivious act; thus, defendant failed in his argument that his unlawful restraint conviction must be reversed because it was based solely on conduct incidental to the underlying charge of lewd and lascivious behavior. State v. Synnott, 178 Vt. 66, 872 A.2d 874 (February 4, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        The test for determining whether a confinement may be charged as a separate offense is whether the confinement, movement, or detention was merely incidental to the accompanying felony or whether it was significant enough, in and of itself, to warrant independent prosecution. State v. Synnott, 178 Vt. 66, 872 A.2d 874 (February 4, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unlawful restraint in the second degree is included within the proof needed to establish the elements of kidnapping or attempted kidnapping, and therefore is a lesser-included offense of the greater charge. State v. Alexander, 173 Vt. 376, 795 A.2d 1248 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although, the jury was entitled to infer both the intent to restrain and the intent to do serious bodily injury from the same facts, defendant's second intent was not a foregone conclusion, and, because the resolution of the issue was the important difference between two crimes, unlawful restraint and kidnapping, under the circumstances it was error not to follow the general rule that lesser-included offenses must be charged when raised by the evidence.

        Defendant was not entitled to acquittal of unlawful restraint when he pushed the complainant down, then pinned her to the bed for five minutes while he yelled at her. The confinement lasted significantly longer than the brief period of restraint arising from the assault of pushing the complainant down on the bed, defendant's act of restraining the complainant was not inherent in the nature of the assault, and the confinement did not facilitate the assault, which was completed at the time that defendant began holding down the complainant.

        There was no plain error in the instruction on unlawful restraint when the trial court did not instruct the jury that it had to decide whether the restraint was incidental to the assault. The jury instructions fairly reflected the law, and even if the independent significance of the confinement could be a question for the jury in an appropriate case, the trial court was not required to instruct jurors on theories of defense that defendant had not pursued.

        Court would not interpret custody and custodial interference statutes so as to permit existence of only one lawful custodian at any one time, since such an interpretation was in derogation of State's avowed policy of encouraging joint custody. State v. Wootten, 170 Vt. 485, 756 A.2d 1222, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 934, 121 S. Ct. 320, 148 L. Ed. 2d 257 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in construing custodial interference statute and therefore defendant's conviction on that charge was vacated; court's interpretation of reach of statute was overly broad, and State did not prove that defendant intentionally kept his infant daughter to unlawfully deprive the baby's mother of custody within meaning of statute.

        In determining when a parent's conduct is sufficiently egregious to support a custodial interference charge in instances where the Department for Children and Families (DCF) is the temporary custodian, courts should consider the totality of the circumstances. Relevant considerations may include the duration of the interference, the frequency with which the charged parent has interfered with DCF's custodial rights, the reason for the parent's interference, evidence of the parent's intent, and the impact of the interference on the safety and well-being of the child; in addition, courts should also consider the nature of the restriction on contact violated by a parent, including the reason for the restriction and its significance in protecting the child's well-being. State v. Roy, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (July 6, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        While a order granting temporary custody of defendant's child to the Department for Children and Families (DCF) did not specify any schedule or parameters for parent-child contact, DCF (through its social worker) provided clear notice to defendant through multiple conversations that visits needed to be supervised, that there was a specific protocol for the child's medical appointments, and that defendant could not take the child out of the state without permission; furthermore, defendant demonstrated understanding of the rules when she attempted to ask for permission before taking the child on a trip to Massachusetts. Thus, the jury had ample evidence to conclude that defendant was on notice that taking the child out of the state for several days without permission would interfere with DCF's custodial rights. State v. Roy, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (July 6, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Uncontroverted evidence of defendant's conduct met the criteria for custodial inference when in violation of the express restrictions set by the Department for Children and Families (DCF), and knowing she did not have permission or legal authority to do so, defendant picked up the child outside of her scheduled visitation time, took her out of the state for two nights, failed to take the child to her regularly scheduled preschool, and without good cause failed to return the child immediately upon DCF's instruction, so that the DCF social worker had to personally travel to Massachusetts to retrieve the child. State v. Roy, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (July 6, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in holding that a court order detailing the conditions for when and how parent-child contact was to occur was necessary to provide defendant with notice of when her actions might violate the custodial interference statute. Although a court order detailing the conditions for when and how parent-child contact is to occur may be one means of proving that a defendant had the necessary notice to prove custodial interference, it is not the only means by which notice may be proven. State v. Roy, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (July 6, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the family court, in the interests of the welfare of defendant's children, issued an order transferring legal custody of the minor children to Department for Children and Families (DCF), DCF was the "legal custodian" of the children when defendant refused to allow DCF workers to take the children into their protection. Thus, defendant failed in her argument that it was legally impossible for her to commit custodial interference, and her conviction was affirmed. State v. O'Dell, 181 Vt. 475, 924 A.2d 87 (May 4, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant was charged with custodial interference, because sufficient evidence was presented to the trial court to demonstrate that defendant was aware that Department for Children and Families was the lawful custodian of her children, the question of defendant's intent was properly a matter for the jury to decide. State v. O'Dell, 181 Vt. 475, 924 A.2d 87 (May 4, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although most crimes are committed by an affirmative act, under some circumstances a failure to act can result in criminal liability.
    To face criminal liability for a failure to act, however, a person must have been bound by a legal duty to act, as where a person has a legal duty under a court order to return a child to her lawful custodian in the lawful custodian's place of residence.

       <p>
        Vermont could properly exercise jurisdiction over prosecution for custodial interference, where children were residents of Vermont at time of their abduction by defendant father, Vermont was children's "home state" under both Uniform Child Custody Jurisdiction Act and Parental Kidnapping Prevention Act and Vermont family court was properly exercising jurisdiction over custody dispute, and information about parties and their situation was primarily located in Vermont. State v. Wootten, 170 Vt. 485, 756 A.2d 1222, cert. denied, 531 U.S. 934, 121 S. Ct. 320, 148 L. Ed. 2d 257 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        A state may impose criminal sanctions for out-of-state conduct that has a detrimental effect within the state. Therefore, where Vermont succeeded in gaining personal jurisdiction over defendant through a court order allowing him visitation rights with his child, both the common law and United States Supreme Court precedent allowed his prosecution under this section for out-of-state conduct (i.e., leaving Vermont with the child and traveling to a number of other places) that had the effect of unlawfully depriving a Vermont resident (i.e., the child's mother) of custody of her child.

        A person steals if he takes property from one in lawful possession without right, with the intention to keep it wrongfully. State v. Reed, 127 Vt. 532, 253 A.2d 227 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        The taking of another's property in good faith, by inadvertence or mistake, may be wrongful but it does not constitute larceny. State v. Reed, 127 Vt. 532, 253 A.2d 227 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Bailee who has possession of goods is guilty of larceny in privately converting them. State v. White, 2 Tyl. 352 (1803).
       </p>
       <p>
        When goods are stolen, and the whole or part of them are found concealed on a person, it is prima facie evidence that he stole them; unless he can show that he came by them honestly. State v. Jenkins, 2 Tyl. 377 (1803), same case 2 Tyl. 384.
       </p>
       <p>
        When goods are lost, it is no excuse in the finder, who conceals or converts them, "that he found them," it being his duty to advertise them. State v. Jenkins, 2 Tyl. 377 (1803), same case 2 Tyl. 384. (See duties of finders, 27 V.S.A.

        Evidence of guilt should not be created against a respondent because an accomplice elects to exercise a constitutional right personal to himself. State v. Reed, 127 Vt. 532, 253 A.2d 227 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        When an accomplice is induced, by hope of favor, to testify against his partner in an offense, his credibility may be adversely affected, and it is customary and proper for court to caution jury to this effect. State v. Reed, 127 Vt. 532, 253 A.2d 227 (1969).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The theft of several articles at the same time and place constitutes but one indivisible crime, although articles belong to different owners, and a conviction or acquittal for larceny of one of the articles would bar a prosecution for theft of the others; but the theft of several things at different times and places, upon the same expedition, creates distinct larcenies.

       </p>
       <p>
        One who feloniously takes property in Canada and brings it into this state is guilty of larceny and may be here tried and convicted of the offense. State v. Bartlett, 11 Vt. 650, 50 Harv. L. Rev. 639 (1839).

        Where defendant was employed as assistant manager of a liquor store, and cash received by the liquor store clerks was regularly deposited in the store's cash registers, which registers were in the constructive possession of the store at the time of deposit, the subsequent removal of cash by the defendant from the registers and appropriation of it for his own use was a trespass and the crime was a larceny. State v. Rathburn, 140 Vt. 382, 442 A.2d 452 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not material whether property which a respondent is charged with taking was in the actual or constructive possession of the person from whom taken. State v. Schwarzchild, 112 Vt. 167, 22 A.2d 177 (1941).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order that respondent be found guilty of larceny, it is enough that evidence tends to show the property in question was in possession of the person from whom it was taken, without tending to show ownership of it. State v. Nelson, 91 Vt. 168, 99 A. 881 (1917).

        If a charge of receiving stolen property under section 2561 of this title is to reach the level of a felony the value of the property must be established as being more than $100, as in the distinction between grand and petit larceny. State v. Olds, 141 Vt. 21, 443 A.2d 443 (1982).

       <p>
        In order to sustain a conviction of petty larceny, it is not necessary there should be evidence tending to show the value of the property taken, if it is of such a nature that it has value, and a specific finding by the jury that the property is of the value of $ 15, merely determines that the offense is petty larceny as distinguished from grand larceny.

        Intent to commit grand larceny is not conditioned on showing that defendant was specifically aware of value of object stolen. State v. Houle, 157 Vt. 640, 596 A.2d 1292 (mem.) (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        The criminal intent involved in the unlawful taking of tangible property, governed by section 3833 of this title, is a different intent than that which is implicated in the crime of grand larceny, and the two intents are mutually exclusive. State v. Hanson, 141 Vt. 228, 446 A.2d 372 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the case of defendant charged with grand larceny, larceny was not committed unless the defendant intended to permanently separate the owner from his property, or at least deliberately act so as to make it unlikely that the owner and his property would be reunited. State v. Hanson, 141 Vt. 228, 446 A.2d 372 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        When taking of property is admitted innocence or guilt can only be found in state of trespasser's mind. State v. Reed, 127 Vt. 532, 253 A.2d 227 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though property be taken openly, the question of criminal intent is for jury to consider according to all circumstances brought before them. State v. Reed, 127 Vt. 532, 253 A.2d 227 (1969).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Since grades of larceny are made to depend on value of property stolen, it is essential that value be stated in indictment or information charging offense, and, when larceny charged is of numerous specific articles all of which are well laid, at same time and place, statement of aggregate value of whole is sufficient, but better form is to allege value of each specific article. State v. Baker, 100 Vt. 380, 138 A. 736 (1927).
       </p>
       <p>
        Description in information for larceny of articles stolen, as "three gray navy woolen blankets, manufactured by the Bridgewater Woolen Company, one green and brown plaid blanket, being a Beacon blanket," and "one aluminum coffee percolator," was sufficiently certain and definite, but description as "a quantity of canned goods, a quantity of towels and a quantity of knives and spoons and two candlesticks," was insufficient as being too vague and uncertain. State v. Baker, 100 Vt. 380, 138 A. 736 (1927).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where part of property was adequately described and part inadequately described, the value thereof being stated only in aggregate of whole, general verdict of guilty of grand larceny covering all, and sentence thereon, cannot stand, since value of part of property well laid not having been found or stated, grade of offense could not be determined. State v. Baker, 100 Vt. 380, 138 A. 736 (1927).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prosecution cannot be begun by information, when the punishment for the crime charged may be by imprisonment in the state prison for more than seven years, as for grand larceny. State v. Magoon, 61 Vt. 45, 17 A. 729 (1888).

       </p>
       <p>
        If there is any testimony tending to prove that respondent took the property and removed it with the felonious intent charged, it is entirely a question for the jury whether the evidence is sufficient. State v. Carr, 13 Vt. 571 (1841).

       </h5>
       <p>
        In the case of defendant charged with grand larceny and breaking and entering in the nighttime with intent to commit larceny, the trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury that it could find the defendant guilty of the unlawful taking of tangible property under section 3833 of this title as a lesser included offense of grand larceny, since the criminal intent involved in the unlawful taking of tangible property is a different intent than that which is implicated in the crime of grand larceny and the two intents are mutually exclusive, and in order for the defendant to be entitled to jury instruction on a lesser offense than that for which he was charged, the elements of the lesser offense must necessarily have been included within the greater offense. State v. Hanson, 141 Vt. 228, 446 A.2d 372 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's conviction on charge of operating a motor vehicle without consent of owner was improperly submitted for consideration of jury, and could not stand, since it was not necessarily included within greater offense, grand larceny of automobile, with which defendant was charged. State v. Nicasio, 136 Vt. 162, 385 A.2d 1096 (1978), overruled on other grounds, State v. Savo (1981) 139 Vt. 644, 433 A.2d 292.

        Crime committed was petit larceny, not larceny from the person, where evidence showed that defendant did not use or threaten to use force when stealing money, instead he snatched money from the victim's purse as it lay in the backseat of the car while she was driving and making conversation; the victim was not aware of the theft at the time it occurred and, therefore, could not have had a sense of fear or invasion at the time her money was stolen. State v. Brennan, 172 Vt. 277, 775 A.2d 919 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to support defendant's conviction on petit larceny charge for stealing money from a vending machine, where eyewitness observed defendant, believed he had broken into the machine and summoned the police, the machine contained few cans of soda and no money, and a matching vending machine key was found in defendant's possession; proof that money found in defendant's possession was the same money missing from the soda machine was not required. State v. Thomas, 152 Vt. 315, 565 A.2d 1335 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        The following evidence was sufficient to prove that defendant aided in the commission of petit larceny; defendant's admissions that he provided accomplice with transportation to the place where the first purse was stolen, watched him steal the purse, and drove him to another place where he stole another purse; testimony of three witnesses who saw defendant and accomplice together during the time period when the thefts occurred; and an officer's testimony that he noticed a crowbar and flashlight in the front seat of the vehicle.

        Defendant was properly convicted for two crimes, larceny from the person and attempted assault and robbery, where he committed larceny from the person of one victim by ripping a necklace with a coin off of her neck, and attempted assault and robbery by threatening to shoot that victim and her husband to gain access to their safe and its contents. State v. Setien, 173 Vt. 576, 795 A.2d 1135 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Crime committed was petit larceny, not larceny from the person, where evidence showed that defendant did not use or threaten to use force when stealing money, instead he snatched the money from the victim's purse as it lay in the backseat of the car while she was driving and making conversation; the victim was not aware of the theft at the time it occurred and, therefore, could not have had a sense of fear or invasion at the time her money was stolen. State v. Brennan, 172 Vt. 277, 775 A.2d 919 (2000).

        The words "parcel of the realty" in this section do not make section void for vagueness and thus unconstitutional as in violation of due process; this section makes it explicit that to steal anything that is part of the real estate is a crime, and the word "parcel," used in connection with the word "realty," has a well established meaning as a "piece" or "portion."

        Because the statute that applied specifically to trespass to trees and timber did not demonstrate a plain intent to repeal the general larceny statute that covered all parcels of realty, and the former did not cover the whole subject matter of the latter, the former statute did not repeal the latter statute by implication.

        Because the statutes that apply specifically to trespass to trees and timber and the general larceny statute that covers all parcels of realty may be harmonized, they did not cover the whole subject matter, and included different mens reas and penalties, the trial court erred when it determined that the trespass statute repealed the general larceny statute by implication.

        The Supreme Court of Vermont overrules State v. Ward, 151 Vt. 448, 562 A.2d 1040 (Vt. 1989) and gives meaning to the phrase "under his care" in this section to extend embezzlement to all cases in which employees convert their employers' property that is within their custody or control by virtue of their employment. State v. Willard-Freckleton, 183 Vt. 26, 949 A.2d 416 (July 20, 2007).

        The status of the principal is a technical distinction that is not an essential element of the crime of embezzlement, and thus it need not be included in an information charging embezzlement. State v. Joy, 149 Vt. 607, 549 A.2d 1033 (1988).

        At trial for embezzlement, it was not error for judge to refuse to instruct the jury that defendant's intent to repay was relevant to the existence or non-existence of fraudulent intent. State v. Joy, 149 Vt. 607, 549 A.2d 1033 (1988).

       <p>
        Where defendant, who had exclusive control over a debt collection agency, directed his bookkeeping personnel to transfer money received from a client's debtor to a bank account maintained to pay the operating expenses of the collection agency, trial court's refusal to instruct the jury that a mere inability or failure to pay creditors was not sufficient to demonstrate the fraudulent intent necessary for embezzlement was not error, since defendant's relationship with the client was not that of debtor-creditor, but rather one of agent and principal.

         1. Constitutionality.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In enacting this section which imposes a greater penalty upon guardians than is imposed upon other agents under section 2531 of this title, the legislature may have wanted to more severely punish guardians who embezzle because of the heinousness of their crime, and the legislature may also have wanted to place the crime of embezzlement by a guardian from his ward under larceny's longer statute of limitations because guardian misconduct is especially difficult to detect; therefore, since a rational basis can be articulated in defense of this section it does not violate the equal protection clause. State v. Stewart, 140 Vt. 389, 438 A.2d 671 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section is not unconstitutionally vague under the due process clauses of the United States Constitution and the Vermont Constitution since the section communicates in a manner more than sufficient to give fair notice to defendants that certain conduct is prohibited and what the punishment will be. State v. Stewart, 140 Vt. 389, 438 A.2d 671 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution under this section in which defendants claimed that the section violated the due process clauses of the United States Constitution and the Vermont Constitution, court found it inconceivable that defendants would fail to understand that conversion to one's own use of payroll checks and funds from trust accounts of incompetent wards would constitute criminal actions and, therefore, rejected the claim that this section was unconstitutionally vague. State v. Stewart, 140 Vt. 389, 438 A.2d 671 (1981).

         2. Construction.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The meaning of this section is plain and unambiguous: the elements of the crime are embezzlement, or fraudulent conversion by a guardian from his ward, and the crime is larceny. State v. Stewart, 140 Vt. 389, 438 A.2d 671 (1981).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Embezzlement by a guardian from his ward is a crime created by statute that is neither common law embezzlement nor larceny; thus, merely proving the elements of embezzlement or larceny would not result in a conviction under the statute, since the additional elements of guardian and ward are necessary. State v. Stewart, 140 Vt. 389, 438 A.2d 671 (1981).

         4. Limitation of actions.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In labelling the crime of embezzlement by a guardian from his ward a larceny, the legislature intended that the six-year statute of limitations for larceny should apply instead of the three-year statute of limitations for embezzlement, since the six-year statute was intended for more serious crimes and embezzlement by a guardian carries a punishment greater than larceny, which is governed by the six-year statute, and since detection of embezzlement by a guardian is extremely difficult, because the ward is usually incompetent so that the guardian can easily hide his illegal activity, and the longer statute of limitations would compensate for this problem. State v. Stewart, 140 Vt. 389, 438 A.2d 671 (1981).

       <p>
        Chapter I, art. 10, of state constitution providing that in all prosecutions for criminal offenses accused has right to a speedy public trial "by an impartial jury of the country," is not violated by provision permitting prosecution of person receiving stolen property in same county where person stealing such property might be prosecuted, although property was received in another county.

        The crimes of receiving stolen goods and larceny are inconsistent, and a thief cannot be guilty of receiving property he stole. State v. Bleau, 139 Vt. 305, 428 A.2d 1097 (1981).

         3. Elements.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The definition of the essential elements of the offense of receiving stolen goods is not set out in this section and must be taken from the common law. State v. Olds, 141 Vt. 21, 443 A.2d 443 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The essential elements of the offense of receiving stolen property are: (1) receiving, (2) property which was stolen, (3) with knowledge that the property was stolen. State v. Olds, 141 Vt. 21, 443 A.2d 443 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court would look to common law for guidance where statute did not define charged crime of receiving stolen property. State v. Bleau, 139 Vt. 305, 428 A.2d 1097 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Common law elements of receiving stolen goods are knowledge that the goods were stolen and receiving them with unlawful intent. State v. Bleau, 139 Vt. 305, 428 A.2d 1097 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not create or define the offense of receiving stolen property; it was enacted to punish the common law offense by its legal or common law designation without enumerating the acts that constitute it. State v. Driscoll, 137 Vt. 89, 400 A.2d 971 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since this section does not define elements of offense of receiving stolen property, court must look to the common law, under which the essential elements are knowledge that the goods were stolen and a receiving with unlawful intent. State v. Longway, 137 Vt. 165, 400 A.2d 1002 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under both this section and common law, time is not of the essence, and location is not an essential element, of the offense of receiving stolen property. State v. Bleau, 132 Vt. 101, 315 A.2d 448 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under common law, obvious essential elements of offense of receiving stolen goods is knowledge that they were stolen and receiving them with unlawful intent. State v. Guppy, 129 Vt. 591, 285 A.2d 717 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since section neither creates nor defines the offense common law must be examined for the essential elements of the crime. State v. Alpert, 88 Vt. 191, 92 A. 32 (1914); State v. Bannister, 79 Vt. 524, 65 A. 586 (1907).

         4. Knowledge.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Although defendant, charged with possession of stolen pipe, was not required to explain his possession of the pipe, his explanation, shown to be contrived and false, was properly taken as evidence of guilty knowledge. State v. VanDusen, 166 Vt. 240, 691 A.2d 1053 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, knowledge that the property is stolen is determined by a subjective standard rather than the objective standard of negligence law; the jury must find that defendant actually knew or believed the goods were stolen. State v. Moffitt, 156 Vt. 379, 592 A.2d 894 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's conviction for selling a stolen rifle was reversed and remanded where trial court had improperly instructed the jury that knowledge was proved if defendant should have known, given all the facts and circumstances, that the property was stolen; proper standard was actual knowledge or belief by defendant that the goods were stolen. State v. Moffitt, 156 Vt. 379, 592 A.2d 894 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Knowledge that goods received were stolen may be found where circumstances of the transaction were such as to induce one to believe they were stolen. State v. Guppy, 129 Vt. 591, 285 A.2d 717 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jury could properly find accused knew goods he received were stolen where, inter alia, though thief granted immunity from prosecution testified he had never told accused they were stolen, two police officers gave testimony, most of it without objection, that thief had told them he had told accused goods were stolen, and where accused knew of thief's criminal background, which included breaking and entering and receiving stolen goods, told his wife to shut up and mind her own business when she asked where thief got all the goods he was storing in rooms he rented from accused in house accused rented, and in some space accused retained, and took and used some of the goods. State v. Guppy, 129 Vt. 591, 285 A.2d 717 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Without resorting to suspicion or conjecture, jury which found defendant guilty of receiving stolen goods could have fairly and reasonably found that he knew of criminal background, including breaking and entering and receiving stolen goods, of thief from whom he received stolen goods, which in itself must have led him to conclude that the large amounts of goods thief brought to house defendant lived in and rented part of to thief were obtained by other than legal means. State v. Guppy, 129 Vt. 591, 285 A.2d 717 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution for receiving stolen goods, guilty knowledge need not be shown by direct evidence, but may be proved by circumstances sufficient to satisfy respondent that goods were stolen. State v. Alpert, 88 Vt. 191, 92 A. 32 (1914).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence that goods were sold to respondent for less than their value is admissible on the issue of guilty knowledge. State v. Alpert, 88 Vt. 191, 92 A. 32 (1914).
       </p>
       <p>
        Respondent's knowledge need not be derived from seeing the goods taken, for it is sufficient if the circumstances of the transaction are such as to induce respondent to believe that the goods have been stolen. State v. Alpert, 88 Vt. 191, 92 A. 32 (1914).

         5. Receipt.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Stolen property is "received" by acceptance of possession by delivery, and by implication, receiving involves a transfer from one person to another. State v. Bleau, 139 Vt. 305, 428 A.2d 1097 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no evidence to support inference accused received stolen property as charged, and all inferences to be drawn from the facts indicated he either found or stole the property, and conviction would be reversed and judgment of not guilty entered, where accused was apprehended by police responding to store's burglar alarm, had run from police, had two cameras one of which had store's price tag, store had a broken window with traces of blood and a broken case with two cameras removed, accused had at time of arrest a cut hand with fresh blood, and accused claimed he had been near the store, heard glass breaking, investigated, saw two males run from rear of store and get into an auto and leave, found the broken window and saw a camera inside the store and one outside the store, and took them knowing they were stolen and intending to take them to the police. State v. Bleau, 139 Vt. 305, 428 A.2d 1097 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        A conviction for receiving stolen property cannot be supported in the absence of proof of a receiving within this jurisdiction. State v. Longway, 137 Vt. 165, 400 A.2d 1002 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Crime of receiving stolen property is not a continuing offense from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, and where state did not prove receipt in Vermont, motion for acquittal should have been granted. State v. Longway, 137 Vt. 165, 400 A.2d 1002 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant received stolen goods from thief who rented part of defendant's house, where thief stored goods in both his and defendant's rooms, a stolen sewing machine, which had been put in a different cabinet, was in defendant's rooms and had been given to him by thief, and defendant had taken other stolen goods as thief's offer. State v. Guppy, 129 Vt. 591, 285 A.2d 717 (1971).

       </h5>
       <p>
        In order to show that the defendant aided in the concealment of stolen property, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt some act or conduct on the part of the defendant that assists the thief in converting the property to his own use or which render its discovery by the owner more difficult. State v. Paradis, 146 Vt. 345, 503 A.2d 132 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution under this section, evidence was sufficient to prove that defendant aided in concealment of stolen property, where defendant had carried stolen items in a brown paper bag, and had indicated that he was contemplating trading the stolen items for food. State v. Paradis, 146 Vt. 345, 503 A.2d 132 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to show that the defendant aided in the concealment of stolen property, the state must prove beyond a reasonable doubt some act or conduct on the part of the defendant that assists the thief in converting the property to his own use or which renders its discovery by the owner more difficult. State v. Foster, 139 Vt. 454, 430 A.2d 463 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution for aiding in concealment of stolen property, where there was no evidence that the defendant ever had possession of the stolen property, exercised any control over it, or knew where it was, and only evidence of an act of the defendant was negotiation of a sale of the property to an agent of the police, proof that defendant actually aided in concealment of the stolen property was insufficient to support conviction. State v. Foster, 139 Vt. 454, 430 A.2d 463 (1981).

        If a charge of receiving stolen property is to reach the level of a felony the value of the property must be established as being more than $100, as in the distinction set forth in section 2501 of this title between grand and petit larceny. State v. Olds, 141 Vt. 21, 443 A.2d 443 (1982).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Common law requires property the subject of charge of receiving stolen property to be some value, however slight, and the value need not be alleged or proven so long as some value may be inferred from the evidence; thus, an allegation of value in the information is necessary, under receipt of stolen property statute, only to establish whether the crime should be punished as a felony or misdemeanor. State v. Driscoll, 137 Vt. 89, 400 A.2d 971 (1979).

        Aiding or abetting in the unlawful receipt of stolen property knowing it was obtained by theft must be proven to convict one of being an accomplice to the crime of receipt of stolen property. State v. Carter, 138 Vt. 264, 415 A.2d 185 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        To be found guilty of being an accomplice, it must be shown that one knowingly and intentionally participated in some substantial measure in a common understanding, the goal of which was the commission of a common criminal objective. State v. Carter, 138 Vt. 264, 415 A.2d 185 (1980).

       <p>
        The casual facilitator of a sale of stolen property, who exercises no dominion or control over the item, cannot be said to have received or possessed it, and without a showing of receipt or possession one is not guilty of being an accomplice in the receipt of stolen property.

        There was insufficient evidence to allow jury to conclude that defendant was guilty beyond a reasonable doubt of being an accomplice to the receipt to stolen property where defendant's son called undercover officer on the phone and offered to sell a $125 saw, officer went to defendant's ex-wife's apartment and met defendant and his son, the three went to another apartment and met two men, defendant's son asked one of the two men for the saw and went to get it from another part of the apartment, it would not work and the men fixed it, defendant only looking on and offering advice, saw was fixed and demonstrated and sold for $45 and one of the men gave defendant $10 out of the purchase money, defendant offered to sell officer fishing equipment located in a closet of the apartment and told officer they would be getting a load of saws if he wished more, and three months later defendant met officer and stated the saw was stolen when asked if it was by officer and further stated he got $10 out of the sale of the saw, and defendant testified at trial that he found out only after the sale that the saw was stolen and did not know why one of the men had given him $10; evidence was more than sufficient to show defendant believed the goods stolen, but did not show he substantially participated in the unlawful receipt to the saw.

       <p>
        Where defendant was charged with violating this section based on facts that he exposed himself and masturbated in front of a young child at a department store, he failed in his claim that under the void-for-vagueness doctrine, the section lacks "sufficiently precise standards to avoid arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement" because the statute is sufficiently certain to inform a person of reasonable intelligence that this type of conduct is proscribed. State v. Shippee, 176 Vt. 542, 839 A.2d 566 (mem.) (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Based on evidence showing that defendant unbuttoned and unzipped mother's pants in full view of her ten-year-old daughter, when taken in the context of an undeniably lewd and lascivious act committed against the daughter moments before, the jury could have easily and reasonably concluded that defendant's conduct was sexual in nature. State v. Penn, 176 Vt. 565, 845 A.2d 313 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section was not unconstitutionally vague, because a person of ordinary intelligence would understand that conduct committed by defendant was prohibited. State v. Maunsell, 170 Vt. 543, 743 A.2d 580 (mem.) (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in refusing to strike as facially over broad or vague probation condition that prohibited probationer convicted of sexual lewdness with daughter from living with his children or contacting them without approval of probation officer. State v. Whitchurch, 155 Vt. 134, 577 A.2d 690 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section was not void for vagueness as applied to defendant charged with exposing himself to three young girls after knocking on his window to attract their attention before he revealed himself. State v. Purvis, 146 Vt. 441, 505 A.2d 1205 (1985).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court which accepted plea of nolo contendere to lewd and lascivious conduct charge sufficiently explained nature of charge by describing grabbing of victim in vaginal area and in breast area and attempt to get on top of her; asking defendant whether he understood that his actions had sexual connotation was not necessary. State v. Gabert, 152 Vt. 83, 564 A.2d 1356 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where charge of lewd and lascivious conduct was based on defendant's masturbating his genitals in public, state was not required to prove, as an element of the offense, that defendant exposed his genitals. State v. Ovitt, 148 Vt. 398, 535 A.2d 1272 (1987).

         3. Open and gross.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Term "open" in this section means "undisguised, not concealed" and requires no more than one witness. State v. Benoit, 158 Vt. 359, 609 A.2d 230 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly denied defendant's motion for acquittal in lewd and lascivious behavior case, since fact a witness viewed victim's naked body sufficed to make defendant's removal of victim's clothing "open" for purposes of this section. State v. Benoit, 158 Vt. 359, 609 A.2d 230 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Section deals only with lewdness which is open and gross and where attempted copulation was done privately and under concealment verdict was directed for defendant. State v. Franzoni, 100 Vt. 373, 137 A. 465 (1927).

         4. Lewd and lascivious.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In light of the unwanted nature of the touching, the context in which the touching occurred, and the sexual nature of buttocks, there was no merit to defendant's argument that the unwanted and public grabbing of a victim's buttocks could not, as a matter of law, amount to lewd and lascivious conduct. State v. Discola, 207 Vt. 216, 184 A.3d 1177 (Jan. 19, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Information which charged that respondent was and is a lewd, wanton and lascivious person in speech and behavior was insufficient to charge an offense under this section as there is no penalty for being a person of that character, but the penalty is for acts constituting open and gross lewdness and lascivious behavior. State v. Ryea, 97 Vt. 219, 122 A. 422 (1923).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where man indecently exposed his person to a woman and solicited her to have sexual intercourse, notwithstanding her opposition, this was open and gross lewdness and lascivious conduct. State v. Millard, 18 Vt. 574 (1846).

       <p>
        Trial court erred in not striking victim statement in presentence information, since lewd and lascivious conduct defendant contested statement and court failed to either make finding regarding statement's reliability or state that it would not take statement into account when sentencing. State v. Grenier, 158 Vt. 153, 605 A.2d 853 (1992).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Evidence that consisted of testimony from a complainant that defendant inserted one or two fingers into her vagina was sufficient to support defendant's convictions for sexual assault and lewd and lascivious conduct, in violation of 13 V.S.A.
        §§
        3252 and 2601; accordingly, denial of acquittal under Vt. R. Crim. P. 29(c) was proper. State v. Hammond, 192 Vt. 48, 54 A.3d 151 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Complainant's testimony supported the jury's finding that defendant committed lewd and lascivious conduct by pressing his penis to her body. The jury was not required to also believe the complainant's claim that he made her touch his penis. State v. Vargas, 185 Vt. 629, 971 A.2d 665 (mem.) (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err by allowing detective testimony that defendant in lewd and lascivious prosecution admitted "what had happened was a problem; that he had a problem before that he sought counseling for," since court decided that evidence was relevant to consent issue, not unduly prejudicial, and therefore admissible under bad acts evidence rule; no abuse of discretion was found in those decisions. State v. Grenier, 158 Vt. 153, 605 A.2d 853 (1992).

         7. Jury instructions.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court was not required to instruct jury that, in order to find "open" conduct, jury had to find that defendant intended to be seen when he fondled himself. State v. Maunsell, 170 Vt. 543, 743 A.2d 580 (mem.) (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant could not first request charge of lewd and lascivious conduct as lesser-included offense and then, when convicted of that offense, successfully claim on appeal that instruction was plain error meriting reversal, since defendant benefitted from, and was bound by, trial tactic he initiated. State v. Grenier, 158 Vt. 153, 605 A.2d 853 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant did not preserve issue of whether court erred in not instructing jury that lewd and lascivious conduct was a specific-intent crime, where he made no argument concerning requisite mental state either during charge conference or when making motions preceding jury's retiring. State v. Grenier, 158 Vt. 153, 605 A.2d 853 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Omission of jury instruction regarding specific intent in lewd and lascivious prosecution was not plain error. State v. Grenier, 158 Vt. 153, 605 A.2d 853 (1992).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        While there was a nine-month delay between arraignment and trial on defendant's charge of lewd and lascivious conduct, the delay was neither long nor prejudicial enough to have constituted a Sixth Amendment speedy-trial violation in light of defendant's less than aggressive assertion of the right. The delay was not extreme in relation to either the nature of the case or the minimum delay needed to trigger judicial examination; an apparent scheduling error caused just over one month of delay, and defendant did not claim that any part of an unexplained three-month delay could have been avoided by the diligence of the trial court; defendant had not aggressively asserted his speedy-trial right; and he had not shown prejudice. State v. Vargas, 185 Vt. 629, 971 A.2d 665 (mem.) (2009).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court properly found that the evidence of guilt was great and that defendant could therefore be held without bail. The State submitted numerous affidavits regarding the alleged felony dispensation of regulated drugs to a minor, and a search revealed Vicodin at defendant's home; regarding the lewd and lascivious conduct charge, the trial court found strong and admissible evidence that defendant was guilty of this charge based on an affidavit describing defendant's acts of lifting the victim's shirt and pulling down the victim's underpants to take photographs of her vagina and buttocks.

       <p>
        Trial court properly ordered that two counts of lewd and lascivious conduct be merged into a single count because the alleged offensive touching occurred continuously without any intervening act over a short period of time. The order was guided by
        Perillo,
        which the Vermont Supreme Court declined to overrule. State v. Carrolton, 191 Vt. 68, 39 A.3d 705 (2011).

        §
        2602 related to abusive sexual conduct involving a minor. United States v. Simard, 731 F.3d 156 (2d Cir. 2013), cert. denied, 572 U.S. 1063, 134 S. Ct. 1874, 188 L. Ed. 2d 916 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Charge of lewd and lascivious conduct consisted of: defendant willfully committing a lewd act upon a person under sixteen years of age with the intent to appeal to his own sexual desires. Aggravated sexual assault, as charged, consisted of: defendant, acting with intent, engaging in repeated and compelled sexual acts with a person. There is at least one element of each crime that is not a part of the other: sexual assault includes the elements of compulsion and engaging in a "sexual act," i.e., contact between certain body parts; lewd and lascivious conduct contains neither of these elements. Lewd and lascivious conduct does not necessarily require physical contact between the perpetrator and victim and, further, it includes the element of appealing to or gratifying one's sexual desires. State v. Wiley, 181 Vt. 300, 917 A.2d 501 (February 2, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Information charging lewd and lascivious contact with minor was not insufficient where it was amended during trial to add missing element; amendment did not result in additional or different offense being charged, and defendant did not indicate any substantial rights that might have been prejudiced by amendment.

        While in certain circumstances the words "lascivious" and "lewd" employed in this section might be too vague to be applicable, where charged offenses involved fondling and kissing of various parts of body of victim by defendant, they were sufficiently obvious to be legitimately proscribed.

       <p>
        Since a delinquent act is defined as an act designated as a crime under state law, and juvenile was found to have engaged in conduct which would constitute the crime of engaging in lewd or lascivious conduct with a child, under the plain language of the statutory provisions, juvenile could be found guilty of having committed a delinquent act.

        Where fifteen year old boy kissed and hugged a girl who was just short of her ninth birthday, and rubbed the genital areas of his partially clothed body against the genital areas of her partially clothed body in order to gratify his own sexual desires, considering the age disparity of the participants, this section was sufficiently certain to inform a person of reasonable intelligence that the conduct engaged in by the boy was proscribed.

       <p>
        Where accusation of lewd and lascivious conduct with a child precluded by its very nature any suggestion of an accidental or unintentional occurrence, defendant completely denied the alleged acts, and trial court charged an intent in terms of this statute, failure to give instruction which enlarged upon court's definition of intent and introduced issue of defendant's frame of mind was not error.

        In a prosecution for lewd and lascivious conduct with a child a conviction may be had for an offense committed on any date prior to the one alleged, so long as it is not barred by the statute of limitations, and in the event of a variance the state ought to be allowed to amend its pleadings to conform to the evidence.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        There was sufficient evidence that defendant grabbed the minor victims with the specific intent to gratify sexual desires required under the statute proscribing lewd and lascivious conduct with a child in light of the sexualization of buttocks, the fact that defendant touched each minor victim's buttocks repeatedly, and also grabbed the buttocks of an adult woman, and the fact that defendant stared and smirked at the minor victims, apparently deriving pleasure from his acts. State v. Discola, 207 Vt. 216, 184 A.3d 1177 (Jan. 19, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a trial for lewd or lascivious conduct with a child, there was sufficient evidence that defendant was the person who touched the victim. The victim testified that "Chris" touched her; the victim's mother testified that the victim knew defendant as "Chris" and that she often found defendant with the victim; the mother's boyfriend testified that he saw defendant with the victim unsupervised; and there was no evidence that the victim knew anyone else as "Chris." State v. Hoch, 189 Vt. 560, 18 A.3d 562 (mem.) (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a trial for lewd or lascivious conduct with a child, there was sufficient evidence of defendant's intent to satisfy his sexual desires. Defendant touched the victim's bottom, explained that this was a bad touch, told her not to tell her mother, gave her money, and visited when he knew that her mother would be napping. State v. Hoch, 189 Vt. 560, 18 A.3d 562 (mem.) (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        The jury's verdict of guilt on the lewd and lascivious conduct charge was not inconsistent with its acquittal on the charge of sexual assault of a minor where, in convicting defendant of lewd and lascivious conduct, it necessarily determined beyond a reasonable doubt that he had committed the specific act of sucking on the complainant's breasts, and, in acquitting defendant of sexual assault as alleged, the jury found that defendant had not committed the separate act of inserting his tongue in her vagina.
    Even though both findings were based primarily on the jury's evaluation of one witness' credibility, the complainant, the jury was free to believe her in part and disbelieve her in part. State v. Wigg, 179 Vt. 65, 889 A.2d 233 (July 29, 2005).

        The jury had more than sufficient evidence to conclude that defendant's contacts with his granddaughter's body, feeling her breasts, and feeling up her thigh just short of the child's vagina, were made intentionally and for his express lascivious purposes. State v. Squiers, 179 Vt. 388, 896 A.2d 80 (March 24, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Based upon defendant's contemporaneous and subsequent comments linking his acts upon the body of his granddaughter with his explicit sexual desire toward her, the jury had sufficient evidence to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that this contact was patently offensive, lewd, and with the intent of appealing to defendant's sexual desires, all as charged and as prohibited by statute. State v. Squiers, 179 Vt. 388, 896 A.2d 80 (March 24, 2006).

        Testimony of child that she awoke to find defendant licking her feet and in between her toes and that that defendant proceeded to rub her vaginal area over her clothes, and attempted to place his hand up her shorts, but was unable to do so because they were too tight, was sufficient for the jury to conclude that he willfully made a lewd contact with the child. State v. Penn, 176 Vt. 565, 845 A.2d 313 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Child's videotaped trial testimony that defendant rubbed her between the legs "in the front" was sufficient to establish State's charge that defendant committed lewd and lascivious conduct with a child by making contact between his hand and her vulva, notwithstanding her testimony that she was wearing clothes at time of incident. State v. Cameron, 168 Vt. 421, 721 A.2d 493 (1998).

        Where, though it was stipulated that a lewd and lascivious act was performed upon the complaining witness, no other facts were stipulated, the only finding was that the alleged delinquent committed a lewd act, and the lower court judge failed to state the facts bringing the case within the ambit of this section, the ultimate conclusion of delinquency could not stand; the fact that the act had been stipulated to was to no avail where the ultimate finding of delinquency and who had committed the act were disputed.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in excluding impeachment evidence offered by two defense witnesses, where only direct evidence of defendant's abuse was complainant's testimony, and court was therefore left with incomplete picture of defense theory of fabrication. In re A.B., 170 Vt. 535, 740 A.2d 367 (mem.) (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        The test to determine if a child victim's hearsay statements are admissible is whether an objective view of the totality of the circumstances indicates that the statements were gathered primarily for reasons other than preparation for a legal proceeding. Therefore, the court abused its discretion in allowing, in a prosecution for lewd or lascivious conduct with a child, a psychologist to testify to what one of defendant's children told the psychologist during an evaluation where these statements were taken in preparation for a visitation dispute in family court. State v. Fisher, 167 Vt. 36, 702 A.2d 41 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution of defendant for lewd or lascivious conduct with his children, the court's error in admitting, through the testimony of a psychologist, the hearsay statements of one of the victims was harmless where several witnesses, in addition to the psychologist, testified concerning the allegations, and the amount and consistency of the testimony from the social and rehabilitation services investigator, the investigating police officer, the children's mother, and the children themselves indicated that the psychologist's testimony concerning one statement by the youngest child was harmless.

        </b>

       </h5>
       <p>
        The statutory meaning of a "lewd act" upon a child is not limited to contact with a so-called "private" or "sexual" part of the child's body. State v. Squiers, 179 Vt. 388, 896 A.2d 80 (March 24, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        The determination of whether an act is "lewd" under the statute prohibiting lewd or lascivious conduct with a child depends on the nature and quality of the contact, judged by community standards of morality and decency in light of all the surrounding circumstances, accompanied by the requisite, specific lewd intent on the part of the defendant. State v. Squiers, 179 Vt. 388, 896 A.2d 80 (March 24, 2006).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court's decision to impose a cash bail of $10,000 to assure appearance was not unreasonable, given the severity of the charges under 13 V.S.A.
        §
        2602, the weight of the evidence, and defendant's own professed intent to relocate to Florida to get away from his problems. Moreover, the trial court had expressly considered but rejected the less restrictive option of appointing defendant's grandmother to supervise defendant. State v. Messier, 194 Vt. 42, 71 A.3d 1246 (May 31, 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case where defendant was charged with sexual assault and lewd and lascivious conduct with a child, there was no reason to dispute the trial court's finding in denying defendant bail that the evidence of his guilt was great. Defendant offered no support for his argument that an oral statement attested to by the complainant at the end of her statement was less admissible than a written affidavit attested to by her at the bottom of the statement; moreover, even if the complainant's interview were not admitted, the trial court could still rely on defendant's own sworn admissions that he and the complainant engaged in sexual intercourse and other sexual acts. State v. Bushey, 185 Vt. 597, 969 A.2d 119 (mem.) (2009).

         15. Sentence.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Mandatory-minimum provision of the statute governing sentencing for lewd and lascivious conduct with a child, first offense, does not exclude or forbid the suspension of all or part of the sentence. Trial courts may suspend sentences in all cases in which incarceration is not specifically required by the Legislature, and there is no specific requirement of an incarcerative sentence in the statute. State v. Fontaine, 196 Vt. 579, 99 A.3d 1034 (June 20, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute regarding sentencing for lewd and lascivious conduct with a child prohibits probated sentences for second and third offenses and specifically requires incarceration. Under familiar principles of statutory construction, the inclusion of such a term with respect to two provisions of the statute and the exclusion of it in another demonstrates legislative intent to exclude mandatory incarceration from the first-offense penalty. State v. Fontaine, 196 Vt. 579, 99 A.3d 1034 (June 20, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's "split" probationary sentence for lewd and lascivious conduct with a child, first offense, was not illegal, as the governing statute did not exclude or forbid the suspension of all or part of the sentence. Accordingly, the State was not entitled to extraordinary relief. State v. Fontaine, 196 Vt. 579, 99 A.3d 1034 (June 20, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's 8-to-15-year sentence for lewd and lascivious conduct with a child under 16 was not improper. The trial court had not ignored available information regarding treatment and rehabilitation, but had stated that the overriding considerations were the nature and seriousness of the offense as well as defendant's refusal to accept how his actions harmed the victim, and defendant admitted that his sentence was less than the 10 to 15 years the State could have sought. State v. Allen, 188 Vt. 559, 1 A.3d 1003 (mem.) (2010).

       </h5>
       <p>
        "Open and gross" element of the statute pertaining to prostitution, lewdness or assignation is not contained within the crime of felonious lewd or lascivious conduct with a child, which applies whether the acts are done openly or secretly, and therefore misdemeanor lewdness is not a lesser-included offense of lewd or lascivious conduct with a child. The same conclusion applies to the offense of aggravated sexual assault. State v. Memoli, 189 Vt. 237, 18 A.3d 567 (2011).

         1. Attempt.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Overt act of attempted voyeurism requires an action that would be likely to end in acquiring a view of the complainant's intimate areas. Here, because defendant was unable to see the complainant's intimate areas from his position on the ground, his actions of standing and looking would not be likely to end in the consummation of the crime intended; the act of merely looking at complainant's window from a place where no view of her intimate areas was possible was insufficient for the jury to find defendant guilty of attempted voyeurism. State v. Devoid, 188 Vt. 445, 8 A.3d 1076 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant was unable to see the complainant's intimate areas from his position on the ground, the State had not provided sufficient evidence of his intent to view the complainant's intimate areas as required for a criminal attempt. Defendant apparently obtained sexual gratification from watching the upper body of a woman he believed was naked, and the Court could infer from that fact that he would like to see her naked; the Court could not infer from the facts in the record, however, that he had the intent to commit voyeurism or would have committed that crime. State v. Devoid, 188 Vt. 445, 8 A.3d 1076 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        When defendant, who should have been acquitted of attempted voyeurism, was unable to see the complainant's intimate areas from his position on the ground, there was no mistake; defendant necessarily knew that he could not complete the crime, and thus his conduct was equivocal. As a result, this was not an impossibility case. State v. Devoid, 188 Vt. 445, 8 A.3d 1076 (2010).

     This subchapter was not unconstitutional under Vermont and federal constitutions as applied to male defendant convicted of soliciting a female person for purpose of prostitution, rejecting argument that because this subchapter failed to proscribe solicitation of males for prostitution, it could not be constitutionally applied to male defendant for solicitation of a female.

         1. Constitutionality.

       </h5>
       <p>
        This subchapter was not unconstitutional under Vermont and federal constitutions as applied to male defendant convicted of soliciting a female person for purpose of prostitution, rejecting argument that because this subchapter failed to proscribe solicitation of males for prostitution, it could not be constitutionally applied to male defendant for solicitation of a female. State v. George, 157 Vt. 580, 602 A.2d 953 (1991).

         2. Construction.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Legislative history and organization of chapter 59 lead inescapably to the conclusion that subchapter 2 of chapter 59 specifically governs the procurement or solicitation of a person for the purpose of prostitution. It follows that the provision prohibiting prostitution, lewdness, or assignation prohibits procuring or soliciting a person for lewd acts relating to prostitution; thus, it was plain error in a juvenile delinquency case to charge defendant's obnoxious and unwelcome touching of a classmate on the playground as an act of prostitution. In re K.A., 202 Vt. 86, 147 A.3d 81 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Argument was rejected that only a male can be prosecuted under this subchapter. State v. George, 157 Vt. 580, 602 A.2d 953 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        This subchapter cannot be used to prosecute defendants of either gender who solicit a male for the purpose of prostitution. State v. George, 157 Vt. 580, 602 A.2d 953 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this subchapter, a female cannot be prosecuted for soliciting a female for prostitution for herself, although she can be prosecuted for soliciting a female for prostitution with another. State v. George, 157 Vt. 580, 602 A.2d 953 (1991).

       <p>
        Information charging violation of this section should set forth the nature of the acts alleged to be "lewd" and "lascivious" with such particularity that it will clearly appear upon the face of the complaint whether their character is such as to come within these terms. State v. Ploof, 116 Vt. 93, 70 A.2d 575 (1950).

         4. Lesser included offenses.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        "Open and gross" element of the statute pertaining to prostitution, lewdness or assignation is not contained within the crime of felonious lewd or lascivious conduct with a child, which applies whether the acts are done openly or secretly, and therefore misdemeanor lewdness is not a lesser-included offense of lewd or lascivious conduct with a child. The same conclusion applies to the offense of aggravated sexual assault. State v. Memoli, 189 Vt. 237, 18 A.3d 567 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in declining to instruct on lewdness as a lesser-included offense of aggravated sexual assault. The "open and gross" element of the statute pertaining to prostitution, lewdness or assignation incorporates a public element for crimes offensive to "community morality," such as prostitution or solicitation, quite distinct from anything involving sexual assault, whether committed alone or with assistance. State v. Memoli, 189 Vt. 237, 18 A.3d 567 (2011).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Evidence supported the conclusion that defendant, a juvenile, engaged in prohibited acts. The evidence, which included testimony from the complainant and an assistant principal, was sufficient to support the conclusion that he reached up the complainant's skirt and touched her buttocks through her underwear. In re A.C., 191 Vt. 615, 48 A.3d 595 (mem.) (2012).

        Indictment for selling obscene book or printed paper should ordinarily set forth the book or paper in haec verba as in indictments for libel or forgery; but this may be dispensed with, and the obscene character of the publication be described in more general terms, if it be of so gross a character that spreading it upon the record would be an offense against decency.

        Jury could reasonably infer defendant's intent to commit the offense of attempting to promote a lewd performance by a child based on evidence of his electronic conversations with the child's mother planning a photo shoot, testimony that he was left alone in the house with the child and that he took the child to her mother's bedroom, evidence of a digital camera seized in the bedroom, and testimony that defendant and the child were lying in bed and that he was rubbing the child's back and flattering her.

        Where defendant was convicted of sexual exploitation of a minor for taking nude photographs and video tape of minor girls, inferred-intent rule applied and allowed court to infer defendant's intent to harm from the nature and character of his acts; defendant's acts of intentional sexual misconduct were therefore excluded from coverage under either of his liability insurance policies.

        Where defendant was convicted of sexual exploitation of a minor for taking nude photographs and video tape of minor girls, his conduct was voluntary and intentional and was therefore not covered under either of his liability insurance policies, and fact that minor pleaded negligence and reckless infliction of emotional distress in her amended complaint did not bring defendant's conduct within policies' coverage, since it was the factual allegations in the complaint and not the legal theories asserted that governed.

        There was sufficient evidence of luring when defendant concocted and executed a scheme to accomplish exactly what occurred: that the victims would trade sex for marijuana. State v. Freeman, 206 Vt. 37, 178 A.3d 326 (Oct. 6, 2017).

        In extending criminal liability to someone who knowingly solicits, lures, or entices, or attempts to solicit, lure, or entice, a child under the age of sixteen - or another person believed to be a child under that age - to commit such an act or engage in such conduct, the legislature criminalized speech integral to criminal conduct. Stated otherwise, the legislature criminalized offers to engage in these illegal transactions; this speech is categorically excluded from First Amendment protection, and the luring-a-child statute accordingly is not subject to strict scrutiny. State v. Masic, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (July 23, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Based on the plain language of the luring-a-child statute, the legislature enacted a criminal statute that is not facially vague or overbroad. State v. Masic, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (July 23, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Luring-a-child statute was not unconstitutional as applied to defendant, as the evidence supported the finding that he acted knowingly by asking an agent posing as an 14-year-old for oral sex multiple times and then driving to a predetermined location to meet with him. State v. Masic, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (July 23, 2021).

        This section and
        §
        2904 of this title do not do away with the common law as to perjury in this state, for they do not cover the entire ground; the former imposes a penalty for perjury, and the latter merely declares that certain acts shall be perjury which were not at the common law.

        Person may be guilty, technically, of the crime of perjury in knowingly and willfully swearing to a false affidavit, made in support and aid of a petition for a new trial. State v. Chandler, 42 Vt. 446 (1869).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        A false statement under oath generally may be punished as perjury only if it was material to an issue in the proceeding in which it was made. State v. LaCourse, 168 Vt. 162, 716 A.2d 14 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where perjury defendant's false statement was made at arraignment on underlying charges, his denial of his participation in the charged offenses was plainly material to the proceeding in which it was made, and therefore trial court's failure to submit issue of materiality to jury at perjury trial did not result in a fundamental miscarriage of justice or denial of a fair trial. State v. LaCourse, 168 Vt. 162, 716 A.2d 14 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        While perjury can be committed only by false swearing in respect of a matter material to the issue, such issue need not be the main issue or question in the case, but it is sufficient if the false swearing be material to a collateral inquiry in the course of the proceedings. State v. Rosenberg, 88 Vt. 223, 92 A. 145 (1914).
       </p>
       <p>
        A mere link in a material chain of evidence, though that link alone would be worthless, is so far material as to be the subject-matter of perjury, regardless of whether there is evidence tending to establish the other links. State v. Rosenberg, 88 Vt. 223, 92 A. 145 (1914).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unless that part of the testimony is found to be false which the indictment alleges to be material, no conviction for perjury is warranted. State v. Trask, 42 Vt. 152 (1869).

         4. Evidence.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for perjury, previous inconsistent statements given by the defendant standing alone are not sufficient to support a perjury conviction. But a defendant's conflicting statements are competent evidence of perjury if corroborated by the testimony of other witnesses. State v. Franklin, 179 Vt. 521, 883 A.2d 783 (mem.) (August 2, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's conflicting statements, a witness's conviction for lying under oath about defendant not driving the vehicle, and the officer's observations that defendant had driven the vehicle and had forgotten to turn off the headlights, were enough to support defendant's perjury conviction. State v. Franklin, 179 Vt. 521, 883 A.2d 783 (mem.) (August 2, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Conviction for perjury cannot be sustained upon the testimony of one uncorroborated witness. State v. Woolley, 109 Vt. 53, 192 A. 1 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        The testimony of the respondent upon the former trial, in which it is alleged that the perjury was committed, may be read as evidence by the stenographer who took it. State v. Camley, 67 Vt. 322, 31 A. 840 (1894).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Rule that demurrer opens whole record and attaches to first substantial defect in pleadings applies only to pleadings in particular case before court, hence, in prosecution for perjury where demurrer was made to respondent's plea of res judicata, such demurrer does not extend to claimed defects in information filed in former prosecution on which plea is based. State v. Bissell, 106 Vt. 80, 170 A. 102 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        An indictment for perjury in violating the provisions of the law in regard to the grand list, following the statutory form, but omitting to aver that the writing was one which the law required to be verified by oath, or to state it in substance that the court might see for itself, but merely quoting the statement claimed to be false, is bad on demurrer; the legislature, in prescribing a simpler form of indictment for perjury, did not intend to dispense with the necessity of alleging enough to show the cause and nature of the accusation. State v. Rowell, 70 Vt. 405, 41 A. 430 (1898), same case (1899) 72 Vt. 28, 47 A. 111.
       </p>
       <p>
        An indictment in accordance with
        §
        2906 of this title is sufficient. State v. Camley, 67 Vt. 322, 31 A. 840 (1894).
       </p>
       <p>
        It must affirmatively appear in an indictment for perjury that testimony alleged to be untrue and false is material; and unless this is apparent from evidence as set forth, it must be alleged. State v. Chandler, 42 Vt. 446 (1869).

       <p>
        The ancient rule which required, as a basis for conviction of perjury, the testimony of two credible witnesses swearing directly to the falsity of the matter concerning which it was claimed that the accused was forsworn, has long since been relaxed, and it is now held that the testimony of one of such witnesses, corroborated by the testimony of another or by circumstances, is sufficient, if thereby the crime is proved beyond reasonable doubt. State v. Woolley, 109 Vt. 53, 192 A. 1 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution for perjury it is incumbent upon state to prove falsity of facts sworn to by respondent by testimony equivalent at least to that of two credible, unimpeached witnesses, and jury must be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt and by preponderance of evidence over and above one credible witness to balance the defendant's oath at least fully equal to one credible, unimpeached witness. State v. Woolley, 109 Vt. 53, 192 A. 1 (1937).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In prosecution for perjury and subordination of perjury alleged to have been committed at former trial, respondent's plea of res judicata, by acquittal of crime then charged, was insufficient to meet test of former jeopardy, since in former case issue was guilt or innocence of respondent of particular crime charged, and issue in present prosecution is truthfulness of testimony at first trial. State v. Bissell, 106 Vt. 80, 170 A. 102 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        Doctrine that truthfulness of testimony in former trial of respondent was necessarily determined by jury therein, and that judgment of acquittal in such prosecution, even though issues are different, is res judicata as to its truthfulness, does not apply to perjury cases. State v. Bissell, 106 Vt. 80, 170 A. 102 (1934).

        Indictment charging respondent with perjury committed before board of civil authority in attempt to get his name placed on check list of voters, was fatally defective where jurisdiction of the board was not set forth with certainty and it was not alleged that he was not legally entitled to vote nor to have his name on the list; thus, where the allegations were that the board was in session to hear challenges to the qualifications of persons whose names were on the list, and all alterations to be made in the list, and that the respondent appeared and requested to have his name added to the list, it was held that there was no sufficient allegation that the board had authority.

       <p>
        Since towns are required by statute to elect annually three or five listers, who constitute a board, a majority of which is essential to legal action, one acting alone has no jurisdiction and his acts would be void; an indictment, charging a lister with perjury in that he had violated his official oath, is defective without allegation of the election of the requisite number of listers, and that they qualified and acted as such.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Indictment in the form prescribed, charging perjury before a grand jury, which does not allege the subject matter of the investigation then being pursued by the grand jury, does not meet the requirement of art. 10 of the constitution, guaranteeing to an accused the right to demand the cause and nature of the accusation against him. State v. Webber, 78 Vt. 463, 62 A. 1018 (1906).

         2. Uncertainty.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        While perjury may be assigned by reciting false testimony relied on, an indictment is bad for uncertainty which recites testimony in the course of which false testimony is alleged to be found, but which fails to point out in what specific answers the alleged perjury is contained. State v. Rowell, 72 Vt. 28, 47 A. 111 (1899), same case (1898) 70 Vt. 405, 41 A. 430.
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislature, in prescribing a simpler form of indictment for perjury, did not intend to dispense with necessity of alleging enough to show cause and nature of the accusation. State v. Rowell, 70 Vt. 405, 41 A. 430 (1898), same case (1899) 72 Vt. 28, 47 A. 111.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Indictment was insufficient on demurrer where it charged perjury in the making of an affidavit to a chattel mortgage in that it falsely stated that the debt was a just one and that the mortgage was given to secure it, but failed to set forth the condition of the mortgage, to describe any debt purporting to be due from the mortgagor to the respondent, to allege that the affidavit was appended, or made to be appended, to the mortgage, to allege that the property was of a kind and in a situation to be the subject of a chattel mortgage, or to set forth the mortgage, or aver that it was one which the law required to be verified by oath. State v. Estabrooks, 70 Vt. 412, 41 A. 499 (1898).
       </p>
       <p>
        An indictment in accordance with this section is sufficient. State v. Camley, 67 Vt. 322, 31 A. 840 (1894).

        The impeding-public-officers statute must be construed narrowly, and a civil violation of the motor vehicle code, on its own, may not provide the basis for an impeding-officer offense, even when that violation is intentional. This interpretation is consistent with the plain language of the statute, taken as a whole, as well as the surrounding statutory scheme and the motor vehicle statutes; this narrow interpretation is necessary to avoid constitutional concerns. State v. Berard, 211 Vt. 39, 220 A.3d 759 (2019).

        In trial for hindering a game warden in the execution of his law enforcement duties, omission from the jury charge of element of the crime requiring that interference be illegal could not have prejudiced defendant and thus did not constitute plain error, where defendant did not claim to have a right to threaten warden with physical violence. State v. Dion, 154 Vt. 420, 578 A.2d 101 (1990), overruled on other grounds by State v. Brooks (1995) 163 Vt. 245, 658 A.2d 22.

        Because a civil violation of the motor vehicle code, on its own, could not provide the basis for an impeding-officer offense, even when that violation was intentional, defendant's refusal to provide an officer with her driver's license, registration, and proof of insurance during a traffic stop, which was essentially an intentional civil violation, did not, without more, constitute a violation of the impeding-public-officer statute.

        Where law enforcement officers went to defendant's mother's house in an attempt to locate defendant's children and execute detention orders, from evidence including testimony of a trooper that while he was attempting to pursue one of the children, defendant pushed him with her hands, causing him to lose his balance, and that the push was not a result of defendant tripping, the jury could conclude that defendant's actions were purposeful beyond a reasonable doubt. Thus, defendant's motion for acquittal of the crime of attempting to impede a police officer was properly denied. State v. O'Dell, 181 Vt. 475, 924 A.2d 87 (May 4, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was insufficient to support defendant's conviction of hindering officer's arrest of her husband, since defendant did not act unlawfully in disobeying officer's command to remain in vehicle, and there was nothing illegal about defendant exiting vehicle and walking along side of car. State v. Stone, 170 Vt. 496, 756 A.2d 785 (2000).

       <p>
        The evidence shows that the deputy reasonably believed she could not carry out her duty without risk of harm to herself because of the defendant's verbal and physical antics which escalated when the deputy informed the defendant of her official capacity and purpose; this activity was certainly enough to "hinder" the deputy as defined under 13 V.S.A.

        13 V.S.A.
        §
        3001 does not require that a defendant make the officer's performance of duty impossible; it is enough that defendant intentionally impeded the deputy's accomplishment of her task. State v. Oren, 162 Vt. 331, 647 A.2d 1009 (1994).

       <p>
        The hindering statute requires only that an individual be hindering a law enforcement officer acting under the authority of this state; thus, liability is not based on whether that officer was performing a law-enforcement function, but only, as was the case here, that a law enforcement officer be acting under state authority. State v. Oren, 162 Vt. 331, 647 A.2d 1009 (1994).

        For purposes of this section, a person "hinders" an officer when the person's actions illegally interfere with the officer's ability to perform duties within the scope of the officer's authority; the term does not cover actions which interfere only with the ultimate purpose of the officer's actions, that is, a successful prosecution.

        Resisting a person deputized by a justice of the peace to serve process under

       <p>
        To constitute an offense against this section the impediment or hindrance must be while officer was in the actual discharge of duties of his office; and an act, which may in its remote consequences only prevent officer from doing his official duty, was not provided against by the statute.

        Advising person against whom sheriff had a precept, and whom he was about to arrest, to draw a line on ground and to forbid officer to pass it, and asserting that if sheriff passed line and the person killed him, the law was on person's side, would support indictment against adviser for impeding and hindering a civil officer in the execution of his office.

       <p>
        Where sheriff, in attempting to execute a writ of execution on civil process, broke open outer door of dwelling house of execution debtor with a view of arresting the body of debtor on execution, such act was unlawful; and where after sheriff had entered house, debtor forcibly resisted attempt of sheriff to arrest him, an indictment would not lie against debtor for so doing.

        Where resistance was made to an attachment, persons resisting will not be allowed on trial of an indictment against them therefor to prove in defense that process, upon which attachment was being made, was sued out by connivance of plaintiff and defendant therein and of the officer, and was intended to be used by them for the purpose of placing the property attached in hands of insolvent and irresponsible persons, so as to deprive the owner of his property, or fraudulently compel him to pay money in order to regain possession of it.

        Charge of impeding a public officer required proof that defendant committed the unlawful act of giving false information to a police officer implicating his wife.

         1. Elements.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Location of the alleged act, while essential to jurisdiction, is not an element of the crime of obstruction of justice. The strictures of the rule requiring that the trial court satisfy itself of the factual basis for guilty pleas therefore do not apply to geographic location, and the absence of the crime's location from the plea colloquy did not deprive the trial court of jurisdiction. State v. Fucci, 198 Vt. 482, 117 A.3d 419 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        In accepting defendant's guilty plea to obstruction of justice, the trial court fulfilled its duty to ensure that defendant agreed to a sufficient factual basis for the "endeavor" element, as the prosecutor's use of the word "believed" described defendant's assessment of the success of his endeavor, and defendant could not have believed he had reached an agreement without having endeavored to reach that agreement. State v. Fucci, 198 Vt. 482, 117 A.3d 419 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        In accepting defendant's guilty plea to obstruction of justice, the trial court did not err in determining that defendant's admission to seeking to have his opponent in a lawsuit killed was a factual basis sufficient to support the mens rea element of "corruptly endeavor." State v. Fucci, 198 Vt. 482, 117 A.3d 419 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        The existence of a pending judicial proceeding is not an element of the crime of obstruction of justice. State v. O'Neill, 165 Vt. 270, 682 A.2d 943 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        For purpose of obstruction of justice charge, defendant's letters to a witness, expressing in direct statements and by innuendo the possibility that his testimony and the testimony of others at trial would harm the witness's reputation and could result in her losing custody of her daughter, posed a threat to the witness, even though they did not include threats of physical harm or force. State v. Ashley, 161 Vt. 65, 632 A.2d 1368 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Obstruction of justice statute requires only that the witness be made afraid or deterred from testifying, not that the witness be both afraid and deterred. State v. Ashley, 161 Vt. 65, 632 A.2d 1368 (1993).
       </p>

         2. Evidence.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where defendant was charged under the omnibus clause of the obstruction of justice statute with "endeavor[ing] to obstruct or impede the due administration of justice," it was not required that defendant succeed in his attempt to interfere with the due administration of justice; a mere "endeavor" sufficed. The State was thus not required to prove that a witness was deterred or made afraid by defendant's threats, only that he attempted to influence her actions. The evidence indicated that defendant told the witness that if his case went to trial he would disclose information that would cause her to lose custody of her daughter. Defendant further asked the witness, the victim's mother, to convince her daughter to drop the allegations of sexual assault. This evidence sufficiently and fairly supported a finding that defendant attempted to obstruct or impede the due administration of justice. State v. Wiley, 181 Vt. 300, 917 A.2d 501 (February 2, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Encouraging a potential witness to lie under oath fits within the charged crime of "corruptly endeavor[ing] to obstruct or impede the due administration of justice." State v. Wiley, 181 Vt. 300, 917 A.2d 501 (February 2, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        At trial for obstruction of justice, allowing state to introduce
    evidence of the underlying crime of sexual assault on a minor was not an abuse of discretion. State v. Ashley, 161 Vt. 65, 632 A.2d 1368 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for acquittal on obstruction of justice charge, where court properly took judicial notice that defendant's arraignment on drug charges took place several months prior to his striking police informant, the act giving rise to obstruction charge. State v. Blow, 157 Vt. 513, 602 A.2d 552 (1991).

         3. Constitutionality.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Although Vermont's obstruction-of-justice statute is content neutral when applied to picketing or leafletting, it is over broad in that it criminalizes all forms of conduct intended to influence judicial decision making, therefore contradicting the First Amendment of the United States Constitution; defendant's picketing in front of a judges house in protected by the First Amendment and claims brought under 13 V.S.A.
        §
        3015 are not valid. State v. McHugh, 161 Vt. 574, 635 A.2d 1200 (mem.) (1993).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Defendant, who was charged with threatening communication to obstruct the due administration of justice, was entitled to acquittal, as his statement that the complainant should tell troopers "nothing's going on, everything's okay" could not reasonably be viewed as threatening because it expressed no overt or implied intention to cause harm to defendant or anyone else.

       <p>
        It was not necessary to allege age of respondent if he was under sixteen years of age; that was matter of defense. State v. Sullivan, 68 Vt. 540, 35 A. 479 (1896).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appearance of respondent himself before jury might be weighed as evidence upon his age. State v. Sullivan, 68 Vt. 540, 35 A. 479 (1896).

         4. Consent.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Charge to jury that if prosecutrix in the first instance consented to the intercourse but after it had commenced withdrew her consent, and respondent thereafterwards forcibly continued it, knowing of her dissent, it would be rape, was not error, since court might well consider physical strength of prosecutrix, the relation she sustained to respondent, and all other circumstances disclosed by evidence. State v. Niles, 47 Vt. 82 (1874).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an indictment charged respondent with assault upon female whose age was not averred with intent carnally to know her against her will, it must be shown on trial that female did not consent, even though it appeared that she was under age of fourteen; for whether or not one can be convicted of an attempt carnally to know a female under fourteen years of age with her consent, that was not crime charged in indictment and for which respondent was on trial. State v. Wheat, 63 Vt. 673, 22 A. 720 (1890).

         5. Mental capacity to consent.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Copulation with a woman known to be incapable of giving even an imperfect consent is rape, but a non compos woman whose infirmity was less profound may consent, as mere fact that woman was weak-minded did not disable or debar her from consenting to act. State v. Jewett, 109 Vt. 73, 192 A. 7 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        There being no statute for protection of mentally defective women, case involving prosecution for rape upon such woman thirty-two years old was to be decided according to common law principles. State v. Jewett, 109 Vt. 73, 192 A. 7 (1937).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution for rape, where there was no evidence that any force or violence was used by respondent, but woman upon whom offense was alleged to have been committed was thirty-two years old but of subnormal mentality, there could be no conviction unless woman was incapable of understanding act, its motive and possible consequences. State v. Jewett, 109 Vt. 73, 192 A. 7 (1937).

         6. Evidence.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for rape the weight of the complainant's testimony and her credibility are factors for the jury to determine. State v. Machunsky, 129 Vt. 195, 274 A.2d 513 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence supported finding that defendant entered plea of guilty to statutory rape without being threatened that he would not be allowed to have an attorney until he consented to plead guilty, and that his plea was made freely and of his own volition when represented by competent counsel. State v. Pecor, 127 Vt. 401, 250 A.2d 736 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence that prosecutrix afterwards complained of act was only admissible as confirmatory of her testimony; mere lapse of time between commission of crime and making of complaint was not test of admissibility of such evidence, but was only matter for consideration of jury in determining upon weight to be given to it. State v. Niles, 47 Vt. 82 (1874).
       </p>
       <p>
        Rule is that it is competent to prove that prosecutrix made complaint, and that an individual, without naming him, was charged with crime. State v. Niles, 47 Vt. 82 (1874).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not error to allow state to introduce evidence of sexual intercourse had on different days, and to refuse to require it to elect occasion on which it would rely till close of its case. State v. Willett, 78 Vt. 157, 62 A. 48 (1905).

       </h5>
       <p>
        That court passing sentence for statutory rape referred to two prior sexual assault complaints which were nolle prossed did not invalidate sentence on ground they were considered as convictions would have been and that due process right was violated, where it must be presumed that the two incidents did not improperly contribute to the sentence and the court had specifically stated that the complaints had been nolle prossed.

       </h5>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for an assault with intent to ravish a girl under the age of sixteen years, question of her consent was immaterial. State v. Clark, 77 Vt. 10, 58 A. 796 (1904); State v. Sullivan, 68 Vt. 540, 35 A. 479 (1896).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant charged with statutory rape was not questioned in either an investigatory or accusational stage in a police inquiry, rule prohibiting use of statement elicited by police during interrogation where request for counsel was denied or where defendant was not warned of his right to remain silent was not applicable. State v. Pecor, 127 Vt. 401, 250 A.2d 736 (1969).

       <p>
        Indictment for "carnally knowing a female under fourteen years of age," with or without her consent," must allege age of female. State v. Wheat, 63 Vt. 673, 22 A. 720 (1890).

        On question of prosecutrix's age in prosecution for statutory rape, evidence of her mother was entitled to very great weight, as was also testimony of child's grandmother who was present at prosecutrix's birth. State v. Reynolds, 96 Vt. 37, 116 A. 116 (1922).

        Where, in a prosecution for statutory rape, prosecutrix testified for state, respondent was not entitled to show by her in cross-examination, as bearing upon her credibility, that, since she was twelve years old down to time in question, she had had sexual intercourse with many different men.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Corroboration of prosecutrix's testimony relating to rape may be supplied by testimony of the mental and physical condition of the prosecutrix immediately following the rape, by fact that the prosecutrix made a complaint at the first opportunity, and by flight of the accused to avoid prosecution. State v. Machunsky, 129 Vt. 195, 274 A.2d 513 (1971).

        Jury could find that penetration, an essential element of rape, existed on the evidence before it. State v. Eaton, 134 Vt. 205, 356 A.2d 504 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Penetration is necessary to prove the crime of rape and such fact must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Machunsky, 129 Vt. 195, 274 A.2d 513 (1971).

       <p>
        Sentence of from 15 to 20 years for rape was not improper where rape was premeditated and planned, victim was 11 year old girl who was physically injured, and presentence report showed defendant had no remorse and did not show potential for successful rehabilitation under probation supervision, even though defendant had no record other than minor traffic violations and same offense had brought lesser sentences for others.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Jury instruction which used an inclusive definition of the term "vulva," which was derived from standard text on anatomy, conformed to standard medically recognized definitions and did not constitute an abuse of discretion. State v. Messier, 146 Vt. 145, 499 A.2d 32 (1985).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In prosecution under subdiv. (3) of this section, state was not required to prove penetration; it needed only to prove contact by defendant within a defined area of the pubic region. State v. Messier, 146 Vt. 145, 499 A.2d 32 (1985).

         3. "Sexual act".
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where in her testimony the victim used words such as "had sex" or "had sexual intercourse" and that defendant "raped" her, and said that sex meant that defendant's penis went inside her, and, where, in telephone calls that were admitted into evidence, defendant referred to the sexual encounter as "we made love," these descriptions of the acts were sufficient for the jury to have inferred that penis-to-vulva contact occurred. The State's evidence was therefore sufficient to satisfy that element of the charge of sexual assault, and the court did not err in denying defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal. State v. Desautels, 180 Vt. 189, 908 A.2d 463 (August 11, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is unclear from the context whether the victim actually meant an "intrusion" . . . into the genital . . . opening," as the definition of "sexual act" requires; the act was not charged, and thus neither party was alerted to the necessity to seek clarification. State v. Crepeault, 167 Vt. 209, 704 A.2d 778 (1997).

         4. Consent.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Purpose and spirit of the sexual assault scheme do not provide sufficient evidence that the legislature intended for fraud to undermine consent when the legislature specifically defined consent and outlined four situations where consent is ineffective without mentioning fraud. There is no indication that the legislature intended for fraud to undermine consent in the sexual assault scheme. State v. John Doe, - Vt.
    - , 249 A.3d 658 (Sept. 18, 2020).

       <p>
        Because the U.S. Supreme Court's intervening decision in Chambers might have rendered the district court's reliance upon defendant's escape conviction as an Armed Career Criminal Act predicate erroneous, however, and because the district court had not had the occasion to consider whether the crimes underlying two of defendant's three sexual assault convictions arose from conduct committed on different occasions, the case was appropriately remanded.

        Differences between the crimes of compelled sexual assault and so-called statutory rape may be apparent, but they are not real. Despite language outlawing one who "[c]ompels the other person to participate in a sexual act . . . [w]ithout the consent of the other person," no actual force or compulsion is necessary to commit the offense. No greater degree of compulsion is actually required for a violation of that provision than is included as a matter of law in the offense of statutory rape. State v. Hazelton, 181 Vt. 118, 915 A.2d 224 (November 22, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant was charged with three counts of sexual assault on his child who was under the age of sixteen and one count of aggravated sexual assault based on repeated nonconsensual sexual acts as part of a common scheme or plan, the long-settled understanding that minors cannot consent to sexual activity in all but limited circumstances rendered those statutes unambiguously applicable to the facts of the case. State v. Deyo, 181 Vt. 89, 915 A.2d 249 (November 22, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutory rape statute did not apply to consensual sexual acts where both parties were under sixteen years of age. In re G.T., 170 Vt. 507, 758 A.2d 301 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Clear legislative intent behind this section is that the criminal nature of the conduct stems from the aggressive violation of the sanctity of the human body and the consequent destruction of the victim's self-worth, and given such intent it is incumbent upon supreme court to avoid a construction of the sexual assault statute which would increase the quantum of proof necessary to establish the physical act of violation addressed by the statute.

         2. Elements.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        For the purposes of the statute proscribing sexual assault of a person under the age of 18 entrusted to his care by authority of law, the State need not prove that the defendant had decision-making authority over the complainant in order to prove that she was entrusted to his care by authority of law. State v. Nelson, - Vt.
    - , 246 A.3d 937 (Oct. 16, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Charge of lewd and lascivious conduct consisted of: defendant willfully committing a lewd act upon a person under sixteen years of age with the intent to appeal to his own sexual desires. Aggravated sexual assault, as charged, consisted of: defendant, acting with intent, engaging in repeated and compelled sexual acts with a person. There is at least one element of each crime that is not a part of the other: sexual assault includes the elements of compulsion and engaging in a "sexual act," i.e., contact between certain body parts; lewd and lascivious conduct contains neither of these elements. Lewd and lascivious conduct does not necessarily require physical contact between the perpetrator and victim and, further, it includes the element of appealing to or gratifying one's sexual desires. State v. Wiley, 181 Vt. 300, 917 A.2d 501 (February 2, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that information did not indicate that the parties were not married to each other was not error; although the information must contain the elements of an offense, the marital status of the parties is an exception, rather than an offense; the affidavit was otherwise sufficient to notify defendant of the charge and allow him to form a defense. State v. Jarry, 161 Vt. 629, 641 A.2d 364 (mem.) (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutory rape law is not susceptible to interpretation as to which conduct is covered and which is exempt; nothing more than a calendar and the person's birth certificate are required to determine the statute's applicability. State v. Barlow, 160 Vt. 527, 630 A.2d 1299 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under statute providing that sexual assault occurs when a person compels another person to engage in a sexual act "(b)y placing the other person in fear that any person will be harmed imminently," the fear-producing threats need not be proximate to the sexual act. State v. Cardinal, 155 Vt. 411, 584 A.2d 1152 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Use of force does not need to be pleaded in prosecution under subdiv. (3) of this section. State v. Thompson, 150 Vt. 640, 556 A.2d 95 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if sexual assault requires element of mens rea, there was no substantive violation of V.R.Cr.P. 11 by judge's failure to mention intent element prior to accepting plea of nolo contendere, where it was clear that defendant knew that women were forced to have sex with him against their wills. State v. Gabert, 152 Vt. 83, 564 A.2d 1356 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Attempted sexual assault is the offense of attempting to compel another person to participate in a sexual act by any of the means enumerated in this section; placing another in fear of imminent harm is one of those means, but not always a necessary element. In re Nash, 149 Vt. 63, 539 A.2d 989 (1987).

       <p>
        Where defendant was charged with sexual assault, testimony of thirteen year old victim that defendant took off her clothes, undressed himself, touched her breasts and her vagina with his hands and his penis and that he was lying on top of her and trying to put his penis inside her was sufficient for jury to find element of contact beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Jones, 160 Vt. 440, 631 A.2d 840 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Motion for judgment of acquittal on two counts of sexual assault should have been granted where record did not establish the element of contact. State v. Prime, 137 Vt. 340, 403 A.2d 270 (1979).

         6. Evidence.

       </h5>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for sexual assault of a person under the age of 18 entrusted to his care by authority of law, the State produced sufficient evidence that complainant was entrusted to defendant's care by "authority of law." The evidence showed that although the New Hampshire agency did not confer legal parental or guardianship status upon defendant, it conferred legal authority to provide custodial care for the complainant, which met the statute's requirements. State v. Nelson, - Vt.
    - , 246 A.3d 937 (Oct. 16, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence that consisted of testimony from a complainant that defendant inserted one or two fingers into her vagina was sufficient to support defendant's convictions for sexual assault and lewd and lascivious conduct, in violation of 13 V.S.A.
        §§
        3252 and 2601; accordingly, denial of acquittal under Vt. R. Crim. P. 29(c) was proper. State v. Hammond, 192 Vt. 48, 54 A.3d 151 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's sexual assault conviction was not against the weight of the evidence when the only issue was whether the complainant consented. This was a case of "he said-she said," and ultimately the jury believed the complainant. State v. Burke, 192 Vt. 99, 54 A.3d 500 (2012), cert. denied, 568 U.S. 1072, 133 S. Ct. 795, 184 L. Ed. 2d 588 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Photographs of defendant's genitalia were irrelevant in a sexual assault case. Defendant admitted having sexual intercourse with the victim, so identity was not an issue. State v. Smith, 187 Vt. 600, 992 A.2d 310 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        In finding that a sexual assault defendant could be held without bail, the trial court properly found that the evidence of guilt was great, as the testimony of the alleged victim, even if ambivalent, could provide a legally sufficient basis for a guilty verdict if found credible. State v. Bertrand, 185 Vt. 574, 967 A.2d 1137 (mem.) (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a sexual assault case, although the State failed to disclose to defendant that it intended to introduce certain acts of abuse into evidence, there was no plain error. Had these two abusive incidents been excluded, there remained ample evidence from which the jury could conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant sexually assaulted the complainant, not least of which was her explicit testimony about that event. State v. Leroux, 184 Vt. 396, 965 A.2d 495 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Acts of physical and emotional abuse which occurred after a sexual assault were relevant as context evidence. The events demonstrated that defendant often belittled and controlled the complainant, and this context evidence shed light on why defendant would engage in a consummately demeaning and controlling sexual assault against his housemate. State v. Leroux, 184 Vt. 396, 965 A.2d 495 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where it could be inferred from the victim's testimony that her cooperation in a sexual encounter arose out of fear of defendant, based on the violent physical and sexual assault occurring only a few hours earlier, his continuing anger, as demonstrated by his verbal abuse, and fear for her children's safety, there was sufficient evidence for the jury to find beyond a reasonable doubt that the victim did not consent to a second sexual assault. State v. Desautels, 180 Vt. 189, 908 A.2d 463 (August 11, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though complainant's testimony was vague at times, where, in response to questions from both the State's attorney and defense counsel as to whether or not defendant had put his finger "in" or "inside" her vagina, she indicated several times that he had, a reasonable jury could have believed this testimony and concluded beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant's finger penetrated her vagina. State v. Lemay, 180 Vt. 133, 908 A.2d 430 (July 28, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        The jury's verdict of guilt on the lewd and lascivious conduct charge was not inconsistent with its acquittal on the charge of sexual assault of a minor where, in convicting defendant of lewd and lascivious conduct, it necessarily determined beyond a reasonable doubt that he had committed the specific act of sucking on the complainant's breasts, and, in acquitting defendant of sexual assault as alleged, the jury found that defendant had not committed the separate act of inserting his tongue in her vagina.
    Even though both findings were based primarily on the jury's evaluation of one witness' credibility, the complainant, the jury was free to believe her in part and disbelieve her in part. State v. Wigg, 179 Vt. 65, 889 A.2d 233 (July 29, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence showing that defendant pushed the complainant onto an air mattress, fondled her, removed some of clothes and his own clothes, ground his crotch against hers, and that his sexual advances ended only when she ran into her bedroom and called the police, did not demonstrate abandonment and, in any case, it was sufficient for the jury to conclude beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant's actions had advanced beyond mere intent to commencement of the consummation of a sexual assault. State v. Synnott, 178 Vt. 66, 872 A.2d 874 (February 4, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where evidence of the attack on the victim showed that defendant's actions had advanced from "mere intent" to the "commencement of the consummation" of a sexual assault, it was sufficient to show, beyond a reasonable doubt, that defendant was guilty of attempted sexual assault; therefore, the trial court correctly denied his motion for judgment of acquittal on that charge. State v. Goodhue, 175 Vt. 457, 833 A.2d 861 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court correctly concluded that prior assault was inadmissible because, although defendant asserted that child had wrongly accused him for an assault her grandfather had committed, and argued that he needed to raise the issue of the earlier assault to impeach child's credibility, the grandfather's assault four years earlier would have added little to child's testimony on cross-examination since there was no evidence that child was confused between defendant's and the grandfather's assaults, child had distinguished the attacks in detail by describing the grandfather's assault as oral contact and defendant's as intercourse, and the prior assault's minimal probative value was clearly outweighed by the substantial invasion of child's privacy and the likely emotional harm that such cross- examination would cause, not to mention the risk of confusing the issues for the jury. State v. Lund, 164 Vt. 70, 664 A.2d 253 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court at trial for sexual assault of child erred in allowing state's expert witness to identify defendant as perpetrator and to imply that child's allegations were true; expert's role went far beyond merely relating victim's account of abuse, and infringed on jury's core function as fact-finder, requiring that case be remanded for new trial. State v. Weeks, 160 Vt. 393, 628 A.2d 1262 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        At sexual assault trial, evidence that defendant had injected cocaine hours before the sexual assault was relevant, where victim maintained that defendant told her he had used cocaine by injection, and therefore evidence could show that victim was placed in fear that she would be imminently harmed by the defendant. State v. Derouchie, 153 Vt. 29, 568 A.2d 416 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Probative value of evidence at sexual assault trial that defendant injected cocaine before assault, which was relevant to show victim was placed in fear, outweighed prejudicial effect that resulted from accusation of illegal drug use, under V.R.E. 403. State v. Derouchie, 153 Vt. 29, 568 A.2d 416 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        At sexual assault trial, improper admission of hearsay evidence, doctor's testimony regarding victim's statements to him when he examined her after alleged rape, was harmless error, where hearsay testimony was very limited, victim testified first at trial, testimony explained why doctor conducted examination as he did, and testimony was merely cumulative in nature. State v. Derouchie, 153 Vt. 29, 568 A.2d 416 (1989).

(1)(A), (1)(B) or (1)(C), since evidence presented by both sides at trial conjoined without objection to all three subdivisions, the court's instructions to the jury charged the subdivisions in the disjunctive and substantially as requested by defendant, defendant did not object to the instruction or request additional or clarifying instructions, subdivs. (1)(A), (1)(B) and (1)(C) were not separate crimes as defendant claimed, but rather separate ways by which the single offense set forth in subsec. (1) could be committed, and even if the jury singled out one of the subdivisions and based its verdict on that one alone, defendant was not prejudiced because he was convicted of one offense, a violation of subsec.

        Proof of force in commitment of crime charged under subdiv. (3) of this section is not "enhancement" increasing the penalty. State v. Thompson, 150 Vt. 640, 556 A.2d 95 (1989).

        Evidence that defendant used force in sexually assaulting minor did not have to be established by proof beyond a reasonable doubt to be used in sentencing. State v. Thompson, 150 Vt. 640, 556 A.2d 95 (1989).

        Sentencing court's finding that defendant used force in sexually assaulting minor was relevant to sentencing, even though force was not an element of the crime, as it shed light on nature of assault and defendant's proclivities, and therefore assisted the judge in determining an appropriate sentence.

        Statutory rape law's different treatment of an adult who has sex with a minor spouse and an adult who has sex with an unmarried minor does not violate equal protection; because of the requirements a minor must complete prior to marriage, the adults treated differently are not similarly situated.

        Information read in conjunction with accompanying affidavit detailing defendant's alleged forcible rape of the victim left no doubt that the State was proceeding under provision of sexual assault statute pertaining to compelling another person to participate in a sexual act and specifically addressing the sexual act and the element of compulsion of that subsec. provided defendant with ample indication of the intent and imminence that the State would seek to prove.

       </p>
       <p>
        The statutes defining sexual assault, sexual assault of minors under, or aggravated sexual assault under did nothing to abrogate an unmarried minor's common law incapacity to consent to sex. The succession of Vermont statutes criminalizing sex with underage children "with or without" their consent do not contradict the common law's conclusive presumption against consent by underage children. State v. Hazelton, 181 Vt. 118, 915 A.2d 224 (November 22, 2006).

       <p>
        New legislation redefining "statutory rape" and providing that a person over the age of fifteen may consent to sex with another under the age of nineteen simply rolls back the statutory age of consent, by one year, for actors within the age bracket of fifteen to nineteen years old. This exception to the common law, expressly carved out by the Legislature, still does not make consent to sex any less impossible for children outside of the specified age bracket who remain, as before, statutorily under the age of consent.

       </h5>
       <p>
        In a case where defendant was alleged to have sexually assaulted the victim while she was sleeping, the trial court's instruction, excerpted from Hazelton, that the "element of compulsion is satisfied by lack of consent alone" accurately indicated that a proven lack of consent on the part of a sleeping or unconscious victim would satisfy the statutory requirement of compulsion under the sexual assault statute. It was irrelevant that the complainant in this case was an adult as opposed to a minor. State v. Snow, 193 Vt. 390, 70 A.3d 971 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jury instruction on sexual assault did not alter any elements of the crime as charged. The information and accompanying affidavit here put defendant on notice of the State's theory of the case, which was that defendant engaged in a sexual act with the victim while she slept; furthermore, defendant did not argue that compulsion was an element of the specific charges against him and then base his defense on a lack of such compulsion State v. Snow, 193 Vt. 390, 70 A.3d 971 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        As the trial court's jury instructions, when considered as a whole, were not misleading with respect to the definition of "genital opening," there was no plain error with respect to instructions provided on a charge of sexual assault, in violation of 13 V.S.A.
        §
        3252. State v. Hammond, 192 Vt. 48, 54 A.3d 151 (2012).

        There was no plain error with respect to instructions provided on a charge of sexual assault, in violation of 13 V.S.A.
        §
        3252, as whether defendant had a reasonable belief in a complainant's assent to his sexual contact was not relevant to the criminal matter; the crux of the defense was lack of intentional sexual contact with the complainant rather than defendant's perceived acquiescence to a sexual advance. State v. Hammond, 192 Vt. 48, 54 A.3d 151 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant was charged with three counts of sexual assault on his child who was under the age of sixteen and one count of aggravated sexual assault based on repeated nonconsensual sexual acts as part of a common scheme or plan, the trial court did not commit plain error on the basis that its instructions allowed the jury to convict him of aggravated sexual assault based on "repeated" sexual acts by finding, in addition to any acts proved in connection with the three individual counts, that only one uncharged compounding act had occurred. Even though the court instructed the jury that they could find the element of repeated acts to have been proved if they found "one or more" acts in addition to the other counts, in a preceding paragraph, the court stated: "in addition to the three distinct acts, which are the subject of counts one through three, [defendant] engaged in other sexual acts with [victim], and in a clarifying instruction reinforced the notion that the jury needed to find that more than one additional act occurred. Moreover, in light of daughter's testimony that her father had sex with her ten to fifteen times, no prejudice can be discerned, because that testimony would have most likely been rejected or accepted in its entirety, leaving the jury to believe that defendant either did not engage in sex with his daughter at all or did so at least ten times.

       <p>
        Error in playing a CD that contained multiple references to defendant's prior sexual misconduct with his girlfriend's child was not harmless in a sexual assault case. A limiting instruction was so vague as to be pointless, and the evidence could have affected the verdict, which essentially turned on the credibility of defendant and the victim. State v. Smith, 187 Vt. 600, 992 A.2d 310 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case where defendant was charged with sexual assault and lewd and lascivious conduct with a child, there was no reason to dispute the trial court's finding in denying defendant bail that the evidence of his guilt was great. Defendant offered no support for his argument that an oral statement attested to by the complainant at the end of her statement was less admissible than a written affidavit attested to by her at the bottom of the statement; moreover, even if the complainant's interview were not admitted, the trial court could still rely on defendant's own sworn admissions that he and the complainant engaged in sexual intercourse and other sexual acts.

        There was no need under the "saving clause" statute to exclude a 1989 sexual assault conviction in determining whether defendant was a habitual offender. The sentence was imposed prior to the date of the amendment of the sexual assault statute; furthermore, the statute applied to a reduction in the statutory punishment, whereas here there was no reduction in punishment but instead a redefinition of the required ages of the defendant and the victim.

       <p>
        State's prosecution of defendant as an accessory to commit sexual assault on a child under the age of 16 was within the statute of limitations. Assuming arguendo that the limitations period could be triggered by the commission of the acts, as opposed to the later reporting of those acts, the limitations period began with the last alleged instance of defendant's aiding and abetting a friend to sexually molest defendant's daughter; either under the original charge against defendant or the amended charge to which she pled, the State's prosecution was within the statute of limitations.

       <p>
        In holding defendant, who was charged with sexual assault, without bail, the trial court did not err in finding that the evidence of guilt was great, because the victim clearly testified that although the encounter was initially consensual, she asked defendant to "stop" once he became violent, after which he nonetheless tried to forcefully initiate anal sex.

       <p>
        Defendant's convictions of sexual assault of a person under the age of 18 entrusted to his care by authority of law and of sexual exploitation of a minor violated the Double Jeopardy Clause, because as charged here, they required proof of the same set of facts and were directed at the same harm stemming from coercive sexual relationships.

       <p>
        Where defendant was charged with three counts of sexual assault on his child who was under the age of sixteen and one count of aggravated sexual assault based on repeated nonconsensual sexual acts as part of a common scheme or plan, the long-settled understanding that minors cannot consent to sexual activity in all but limited circumstances rendered those statutes unambiguously applicable to the facts of the case. State v. Deyo, 181 Vt. 89, 915 A.2d 249 (November 22, 2006).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Charge of lewd and lascivious conduct consisted of: defendant willfully committing a lewd act upon a person under sixteen years of age with the intent to appeal to his own sexual desires. Aggravated sexual assault, as charged, consisted of: defendant, acting with intent, engaging in repeated and compelled sexual acts with a person. There is at least one element of each crime that is not a part of the other: sexual assault includes the elements of compulsion and engaging in a "sexual act," i.e., contact between certain body parts; lewd and lascivious conduct contains neither of these elements. Lewd and lascivious conduct does not necessarily require physical contact between the perpetrator and victim and, further, it includes the element of appealing to or gratifying one's sexual desires. State v. Wiley, 181 Vt. 300, 917 A.2d 501 (February 2, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Having found distinctions between the elements of sexual assault and lewd and lascivious conduct, it was concluded that the Legislature intended to allow multiple convictions and punishments for the same conduct under these differently defined offenses. State v. Wiley, 181 Vt. 300, 917 A.2d 501 (February 2, 2007).

        .
       </h5>
       <p>
        Defendant's convictions of repeated aggravated sexual assault and sexual assault of a person under the age of 18 entrusted to his care by authority of law did not violate the Double Jeopardy Clause, as each crime as charged required proof of at least one element that the other did not, and there was no clear legislative intent to preclude prosecution for both offenses as charged here. State v. Nelson, - Vt.
    - , 246 A.3d 937 (Oct. 16, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant was convicted of both aggravated murder and aggravated sexual assault, his sentence for aggravated sexual assault was impermissible under the Double Jeopardy Clause; serious bodily injury is always proved by proof of death and therefore aggravated sexual assault was a lesser-included offense of aggravated murder, since the lesser offense required no proof beyond that required of the greater offense. State v. Grega, 168 Vt. 363, 721 A.2d 445 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Multiple convictions cannot stand to provide a backup conviction in event that conviction on greater offense is reversed, and therefore murder defendant's conviction for aggravated sexual assault was vacated. State v. Grega, 168 Vt. 363, 721 A.2d 445 (1998).

       <p>
        In deciding whether an incident of sexual assault consists of one continuous assault or separate acts, court considers elapsed time between successive parts of defendant's conduct, whether defendant's conduct occurred in more than one geographic location, whether an intervening event occurred between successive parts of defendant's conduct, and whether there was sufficient time for reflection between assaultive acts for defendant to again commit himself. State v. Fuller, 168 Vt. 396, 721 A.2d 475 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to convict defendant of two separate sexual assaults of his step-son, where there was sufficient evidence to prove that, during the same occurrence, step-son was subjected to repeated nonconsensual sexual acts by defendant, in violation of plain language of statute.

       <p>
        In a prosecution for aggravated sexual assault, the State produced sufficient evidence that the complainant was under 13 years of age when there was evidence that the conduct underlying the criminal charge took place between January 2007 and March 2007 and that the complainant was 17 years old in December 2016, and when the complainant also testified that he was six or seven years old when the assault occurred. State v. Tobin, 208 Vt. 518, 199 A.3d 1069 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was sufficient evidence that defendant was guilty of aggravated sexual assault. The victim testified that defendant engaged in three sexual acts with her when she was younger than 16, below the age of consent; three witnesses testified that they were present during these sexual acts; and a common plan and scheme was shown from victim and witness testimony that on each occasion, defendant arranged via text messaging to meet the victim to exchange sex for marijuana and that after the victim performed oral sex on defendant he gave her marijuana. State v. Freeman, 206 Vt. 37, 178 A.3d 326 (Oct. 6, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution for aggravated sexual assault, where evidence showed that the victim could not breathe because defendant was shoving rocks, dirt, and gravel into her mouth, the trial court did not err in finding that the evidence sufficiently and fairly supported the jury's determination that defendant's conduct constituted deadly force.

        In prosecution for aggravated sexual assault, even though defendant claimed that he did not have the intent required for conviction under the statute because he did not intend to cause death or serious bodily to the victim when he shoved dirt, rocks and gravel into her mouth, it was reasonable for the jury to find that he should have known that his actions would create a substantial risk of death or serious bodily injury, which is all that is required under the definition of deadly force.

       <p>
        Where defendant was charged with three counts of sexual assault on his child who was under the age of sixteen and one count of aggravated sexual assault based on repeated nonconsensual sexual acts as part of a common scheme or plan, the trial court did not commit plain error on the basis that its instructions allowed the jury to convict him of aggravated sexual assault based on "repeated" sexual acts by finding, in addition to any acts proved in connection with the three individual counts, that only one uncharged compounding act had occurred. Even though the court instructed the jury that they could find the element of repeated acts to have been proved if they found "one or more" acts in addition to the other counts, in a preceding paragraph, the court stated: "in addition to the three distinct acts, which are the subject of counts one through three, [defendant] engaged in other sexual acts with [victim], and in a clarifying instruction reinforced the notion that the jury needed to find that more than one additional act occurred. Moreover, in light of daughter's testimony that her father had sex with her ten to fifteen times, no prejudice can be discerned, because that testimony would have most likely been rejected or accepted in its entirety, leaving the jury to believe that defendant either did not engage in sex with his daughter at all or did so at least ten times. State v. Deyo, 181 Vt. 89, 915 A.2d 249 (November 22, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was not error to instruct the jury that sexual acts between an adult and his minor child under age sixteen were nonconsensual as a matter of law. The fair administration of justice does not require that a jury be instructed that the consent defense is available to an adult charged with aggravated assault for repeatedly sexually assaulting his thirteen-year-old child. State v. Deyo, 181 Vt. 89, 915 A.2d 249 (November 22, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a post-conviction proceeding following conviction of petitioner for aggravated sexual assault, petitioner failed in his claim that jury instructions were faulty because they omitted the requirement that serious bodily injury under the statute be imminent, where the trial court clearly instructed the jury that serious bodily injury must be imminent and, further, the court's explanations of other elements included the imminence requirement, as did the jury verdict form. In re Carter, 176 Vt. 322, 848 A.2d 281 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for aggravated sexual assault, where, taken as a whole, the jury instructions provided sufficient guidance on the requirement that the serious bodily injury be imminent, there was no plain error. In re Carter, 176 Vt. 322, 848 A.2d 281 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a post-conviction proceeding following his conviction for aggravated sexual assault, petitioner failed in his claim that it was plain error for the trial court to instruct the jury that the offense required threats of "serious bodily injury to the victim or to another," without expressly requiring unanimity as to whom the threat was directed, and in his argument that the charge did not ensure unanimity on this element, because the evidence showed threats both to the victim and to her family.

        Because there was no indication that the legislature intended for fraud to undermine consent in the sexual assault scheme, there was no probable cause to support the charge that defendant committed aggravated sexual assault by lying to the complainant about his HIV status, thereby invalidating her consent. State v. John Doe, - Vt.
    - , 249 A.3d 658 (Sept. 18, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statutes defining sexual assault, sexual assault of minors under, or aggravated sexual assault under did nothing to abrogate an unmarried minor's common law incapacity to consent to sex. The succession of Vermont statutes criminalizing sex with underage children "with or without" their consent do not contradict the common law's conclusive presumption against consent by underage children.

       <p>
        What is absolutely clear from the aggravated sexual assault statute and the indeterminate life sentence statute is that the legislature intended those who sexually assault children to face severe mandatory penalties, and that only downward departures from those penalties need be justified by written findings. State v. Avgoustov, 185 Vt. 610, 969 A.2d 139 (mem.) (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        In sentencing defendant to the statutory default sentence for aggravated assault of a minor, the trial court was not required to make written findings. The sexual assault statute required only that written findings be made if the trial court imposed a lesser sentence than the 10-year presumptive minimum. State v. Avgoustov, 185 Vt. 610, 969 A.2d 139 (mem.) (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        In sentencing defendant to the statutory default sentence for aggravated assault of a minor, a seven-year-old, the trial court did not err. The trial court considered defendant's psychosexual evaluation (PSE) and a presentence investigation report (PSI); it found that although working in a circus camp might have contributed to defendant's conduct, defendant was responsible for his presence in that setting; it did not err in deeming the prospect of deportation a neutral factor; defendant's assertion that there was no evidence in the record supporting the finding that his crime had had a lasting impact on the victim was directly contrary to the victim's parents' testimony; the trial court's more general statements concerning the impact of sexual assaults on very young victims did nothing more than recognize the widely held beliefs that prompted the legislature to penalize such crimes so severely; and the PSE and the PSI both supported the finding that although defendant might not have posed a high risk to reoffend, he did present some risk. State v. Avgoustov, 185 Vt. 610, 969 A.2d 139 (mem.) (2009).

        Aggravated assault statute does not define the crime of aggravated sexual assault to include those persons who "join or assist" another's sexual assault; instead, it provides that a person commits the crime of aggravated sexual assault if the person commits sexual assault under any one of the following circumstances: the actor is joined or assisted by one or more persons in physically restraining, assaulting or sexually assaulting the victim. The statute requires as a predicate for criminal liability that a person commit sexual assault. State v. Wilder, 187 Vt. 383, 996 A.2d 174 (2010).

        As to the second counts of aggravated sexual assault, the prosecution did not charge either defendant with committing the crime of sexual assault; the prosecution charged only that the defendant joined or assisted when the other person committed sexual assault. Thus, the court could not find that the conduct for which each defendant was charged in the second count was a crime. State v. Wilder, 187 Vt. 383, 996 A.2d 174 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the alleged offense charged in the count of aggravated sexual assault for each defendant was similar to that of aiding in the commission of a felony as an accessory, the information did not charge defendants as accessories, and the count of aggravated sexual assault also did not properly charge defendants as principals under the statute as enacted by the legislature. The problem was that the State sought to create two crimes out of the one that the legislature authorized, without proving the elements of aiding in the commission of a crime, and this was a fundamental error which required that defendants' convictions of aggravated sexual assault be vacated. State v. Wilder, 187 Vt. 383, 996 A.2d 174 (2010).

       </h5>
       <p>
        "Open and gross" element of the statute pertaining to prostitution, lewdness or assignation is not contained within the crime of felonious lewd or lascivious conduct with a child, which applies whether the acts are done openly or secretly, and therefore misdemeanor lewdness is not a lesser-included offense of lewd or lascivious conduct with a child. The same conclusion applies to the offense of aggravated sexual assault. State v. Memoli, 189 Vt. 237, 18 A.3d 567 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in declining to instruct on lewdness as a lesser-included offense of aggravated sexual assault. The "open and gross" element of the statute pertaining to prostitution, lewdness or assignation incorporates a public element for crimes offensive to "community morality," such as prostitution or solicitation, quite distinct from anything involving sexual assault, whether committed alone or with assistance. State v. Memoli, 189 Vt. 237, 18 A.3d 567 (2011).

         14. Sufficiency of information.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Although the facts alleged in the affidavit supported a charge of aggravated sexual assault, defendant's inability to ascertain the penalty prejudiced defendant and violated his right under the rule regarding the nature and contents of an indictment or information to be notified of the charges. Moreover, because defendant's underlying convictions violated the Ex Post Facto Clause, relying on the sufficiency of the information to find defendant guilty of the statutes in effect at the time of his alleged acts stretched the limits of the rule. State v. Rondeau, 203 Vt. 518, 159 A.3d 1073 (Nov. 18, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Information did not provide sufficient notice to sustain defendant's conviction under either the pre-1990 or post-1990 version of aggravated sexual assault. On its face, the count as charged created an ambiguity because defendant could not reasonably know which aggravated sexual assault statute applied to the conduct; moreover, under either version of the statute, the information lacked an essential element necessary to sustain defendant's conviction: serious bodily injury under the pre-1990 statute and the age of the victim under the version in effect from 1990 to 2006. State v. Rondeau, 203 Vt. 518, 159 A.3d 1073 (Nov. 18, 2016).

        Vermont law reflects the State's enhanced concern for the protection and well-being of minors and the gravity it attaches to crimes involving the exploitation of minors. There are no grounds upon which to conclude that the Legislature's policy choice regarding the sentence for aggravated sexual assault of a child runs counter to the Eighth Amendment. State v. Bellanger, 206 Vt. 489, 183 A.3d 550 (Mar. 3, 2017).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Because the State's evidence distinguished between the details of various isolated incidents of sexual contact, the evidence was sufficiently materially distinguishable to enable jurors to isolate the specific instances of sexual contact that they found formed the factual basis for aggravated sexual assault of a child; furthermore, the State did not elect which of the alleged acts should serve as a basis for the violation of the statute. Thus, a specific unanimity instruction should have been given to ensure that the jury as a whole convicted based on the same two or more acts. State v. Bellanger, 206 Vt. 489, 183 A.3d 550 (Mar. 3, 2017).

         1. Constitutionality.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Prohibition against deposing complaining witnesses concerning prior sexual conduct, contained in subdivision (c) of this section, did not violate defendant's rights to confrontation or due process; right of confrontation was a trial right not implicated by pretrial discovery restrictions, and defendant made no due process showing to indicate that evidence was material to his defense and not otherwise available. State v. Roya, 167 Vt. 594, 708 A.2d 908 (mem.) (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        In sexual assault case, defendant's right to confront witness against him was not impermissibly abrogated by exclusion of evidence of prior sexual relationship with victim under rape shield statute; lapse of time between assault and prior relationship rendered the evidence nonprobative on the issue of consent or credibility, and cross-examination was inappropriate under protective purposes of this section. State v. Lavalette, 154 Vt. 426, 578 A.2d 108 (1990).

         2. Applicability.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Rape Shield law did not apply to allegedly false statements by the complainant and her friend that a third party sexually assaulted her friend because the evidence did not relate to the prior sexual conduct of the complainant. Furthermore, the evidence did not relate to a prior false allegation of sexual assault of the complainant. State v. Burke, 192 Vt. 99, 54 A.3d 500 (2012), cert. denied, 568 U.S. 1072, 133 S. Ct. 795, 184 L. Ed. 2d 588 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Rape shield statute was not applicable because defendant did not seek to introduce evidence of the complainant's prior sexual conduct. Rather, defendant requested to admit evidence of the complainant's crack cocaine use both before and after the incident to demonstrate that her desire for cocaine was strong enough to motivate her to consent to sexual interactions with him in exchange for the drug. State v. Memoli, 189 Vt. 237, 18 A.3d 567 (2011).

       <p>
        This section is the application of the general rule that past conduct is not admissible to prove present conduct to the specific circumstances of rape, where the "private character" of the past sexual conduct is responsible for the harm, such as the dangers of unfair prejudice, confusion of the issues, misleading the jury, or miring the court in collateral issues, which would result if such evidence were admitted. State v. Patnaude, 140 Vt. 361, 438 A.2d 402 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        The "private character" test embodied in subsec. (a)(3) of this section is a specific application of the general test of legal relevancy. State v. Patnaude, 140 Vt. 361, 438 A.2d 402 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        The "private character" test for sexual assault cases, set forth in subsec. (a)(3) of this section, is synonymous with the traditional tests for legal relevance admissible generally in criminal and civil trials. State v. Patnaude, 140 Vt. 361, 438 A.2d 402 (1981).

         4. Purpose.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        As the purpose of the state's questioning of a complainant's sexual innocence was not to suggest or prove rape, but instead was to meet defendant's attack on the reason stated by the complainant for less than full disclosure to her mother, the Rape Shield Act, 13 V.S.A.
        §
        3255, was inapposite to the subject matter, and the testimony was properly allowed. State v. Hammond, 192 Vt. 48, 54 A.3d 151 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Rape Shield Act, 13 V.S.A.
        §
        3255, was inapplicable to defendant's claim that it barred evidence of prior sexual history to counter challenges to the complainant's credibility, as there was no forbidden purpose behind the State's redirect examination in response to defendant's attack on the complainant's reason for nondisclosure of his sexual attack on her to her mother. State v. Hammond, 192 Vt. 48, 54 A.3d 151 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section of Vermont's sexual assault act represents an explicit legislative decision to eliminate trial practices under the former rape law that had effectively frustrated society's vital interest in the prosecution of sex crimes. State v. Patnaude, 140 Vt. 361, 438 A.2d 402 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        The legislature, in enacting this section, rejected the former view that in rape, unlike all other areas of the law, past acts prove the existence of a corrupt mind which inclines the witness to automatic consent on all occasions. State v. Patnaude, 140 Vt. 361, 438 A.2d 402 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        In enacting this section, the legislature increased the reliability of the judicial system by excluding worthless evidence, increased the number of rapes actually reported and made it less likely that highly inflammatory information with no logical connection to the issues at trial would bring about unwarranted acquittals. State v. Patnaude, 140 Vt. 361, 438 A.2d 402 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Among the purposes expressly given by the legislature for enacting this section was to protect victims from an inquisition into their past sexual conduct and to treat past conduct evidence uniformly, whether in rape cases or in the law generally, and these two purposes were reflected in the test mandated by subsec. (a)(3) of this section, requiring that probative value be weighed against the "private character" of the evidence. State v. Patnaude, 140 Vt. 361, 438 A.2d 402 (1981).

       <p>
        Evidence that defendant thought that 14-year-old sexual assault victim was sexually active was not inadmissible as violative of subsec. (a) of this section where it was not admitted to prove that victim was promiscuous and therefore probably consented, as consent was not in issue, but to show the assault more probable than if he had thought of her as sexually inactive. State v. Giroux, 151 Vt. 361, 561 A.2d 403 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        At sexual assault trial, it was error to exclude evidence of prior consensual sexual activity over a period of years between complainant and defendant, coupled with a claimed consensual act reasonably contemporaneous with the act complained of, since this evidence was clearly material on the issue of consent and its probative value outweighed its private character. State v. Gonyaw, 146 Vt. 559, 507 A.2d 944 (1985).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court correctly concluded that prior assault was inadmissible because, although defendant asserted that child had wrongly accused him for an assault her grandfather had committed, and argued that he needed to raise the issue of the earlier assault to impeach child's credibility, the grandfather's assault four years earlier would have added little to child's testimony on cross-examination since there was no evidence that child was confused between defendant's and the grandfather's assaults, child had distinguished the attacks in detail by describing the grandfather's assault as oral contact and defendant's as intercourse, and the prior assault's minimal probative value was clearly outweighed by the substantial invasion of child's privacy and the likely emotional harm that such cross- examination would cause, not to mention the risk of confusing the issues for the jury. State v. Lund, 164 Vt. 70, 664 A.2d 253 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        In child sexual assault case where trial court permitted defendant to cross-examine prosecution's expert witness about whether, in her opinion, a prior sexual assault by another person might have been an alternative cause of the victim's post-traumatic stress disorder, refusal to allow defendant to cross-examine the victim about the prior sexual assault did not deny defendant his right of confrontation. State v. Catsam, 148 Vt. 366, 534 A.2d 184 (1987).

         9. Exclusion of evidence.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Evidence of an incident where defendant saw the complainant masturbating and then began masturbating as well was properly excluded under the "rape shield" law because its private character outweighed its probative value in that it was an isolated incident occurring five months prior to the initial sexual contact. State v. Patten, 208 Vt. 312, 197 A.3d 873 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's proffered testimony did not fall within exception to Vermont's Rape Shield Statute where defendant claimed that victim had made false allegations of sexual harassment in workplace but, to invoke exception, defendant needed to demonstrate that victim made prior false allegation of sexual assault. State v. Goodnow, 162 Vt. 527, 649 A.2d 752 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly barred inquiries regarding whether rape victim had been tested for chlamydia where the testimony would bear on the victim's prior sexual conduct and were not included in any of the statutory exceptions. State v. Jarry, 161 Vt. 629, 641 A.2d 364 (mem.) (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        In sexual assault case, trial court properly exercised its discretion under this section to exclude evidence of prior sexual relationship between defendant and victim that terminated eighteen months prior to the assault. State v. Lavalette, 154 Vt. 426, 578 A.2d 108 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        At trial for sexual assault upon a minor, court was justified in excluding evidence of prior false allegations of sexual abuse purportedly made by victim, where defense counsel conceded that he did not know whether the allegations about which he sought to inquire were in fact false. State v. Ross, 152 Vt. 462, 568 A.2d 335 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        At trial for sexual assault upon a minor, court did not err by excluding evidence that alleged victim had been sexually assaulted by other alleged abusers, pursuant to this section, where testimony at trial did in fact establish that victim had been sexually abused by her stepfather and others, thus demonstrating another possible source for victim's posttraumatic stress disorder syndrome. State v. Ross, 152 Vt. 462, 568 A.2d 335 (1989).

        In prosecutions for sexual assault, trial court did not err in allowing the prosecutor in final argument to the jury to comment on defendant's failure to rebut evidence offered by state to the effect that one of the complaining witnesses had not ever had prior sexual intercourse with any of the defendants, ever dated any of them, or even knew who they were, since it is within the purview of this section for the court to admit evidence of specific instances of the complaining witness' past sexual conduct with the defendants, or either of them, and the trial judge had in no way precluded the defendants from offering evidence of prior sexual conduct of this prosecuting witness with either of them if they had any such evidence.

        Defense attorney was properly held in criminal contempt for violating the rape shield law. There could be no doubt that counsel was on notice that evidence concerning the victim's prior sexual conduct, with the exception of the victim's reference to an eighteen-year old who allegedly impregnated her in 2008, was barred; not only was this evidence expressly prohibited by the plain language of the rape shield law, but it was also wholly irrelevant.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Convicted sex offenders have greatly diminished privacy interests, particularly with respect to precluding the testing of bodily fluids forced upon their victims in criminal sexual acts. Moreover, the taking of a blood sample or a cheek swab is a relatively minimal intrusion on privacy. State v. Handy, 191 Vt. 311, 44 A.3d 776 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Degree to which convicted sex offenders may be subject to the more significant invasion of privacy associated with mandatory HIV testing is a function of how widely the results are disseminated. The risk of stigmatic harm therefore speaks not to whether the search should transpire in the first instance, but rather to the extent to which the private medical facts learned from the procedure should be disclosed; in short, the only privacy interest of any significance in this context is the risk of public dissemination of positive test results. State v. Handy, 191 Vt. 311, 44 A.3d 776 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the consensus among medical experts is that testing sex offenders for sexually transmitted diseases - particularly following conviction after months or even years have passed - has little or no direct medical benefit to victims, testing offenders can provide to victims some psychological benefit that outweighs the offenders' significantly diminished interest in preventing the testing of bodily fluids forced upon their unwilling victims. State v. Handy, 191 Vt. 311, 44 A.3d 776 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        As long as the trial court imposes restrictions that comport with the statute's obvious intent to prevent public dissemination of the perpetrator's test results, there is no constitutional infirmity to allowing sexual offenders to be tested for infectious diseases under Article Eleven. The statute provides that the results of the offender's test shall be disclosed only to the offender and the victim; plainly, the legislature was concerned with the privacy rights of offenders and chose to strictly limit revelation of their test results. State v. Handy, 191 Vt. 311, 44 A.3d 776 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutes such as that allowing sexual offenders to be tested for infectious diseases are directed at public health matters, not law enforcement, and therefore satisfy the first part of the special-needs standard for administrative searches; indeed, the statute explicitly states that samples taken of the sexual offenders "shall be used solely for the purposes of this section," and thus test results from the samples may not be used for criminal prosecution or other law enforcement purposes. Moreover, the courts have also recognized that imposing probable-cause and warrant requirements would be entirely impracticable in this context because many sexually transmitted diseases, and most particularly the AIDS virus, have no outward manifestations that would permit a probable-cause determination for obtaining a warrant; hence, requiring probable cause and a warrant for such searches would effectively preclude the testing of sex offenders and thus negate the statute. State v. Handy, 191 Vt. 311, 44 A.3d 776 (2012).

       <p>
        Court affirmed an order requiring defendant, a convicted sex offender, to submit to testing for sexually transmitted diseases. To safeguard defendant's privacy interests in not having any potential positive test results disseminated publicly, the court remanded the matter for the trial court to order the victim not to disclose defendant's test results to anyone except for the victim's medical provider or counselor, who, in turn, would have an obligation to keep confidential information revealed by their patients. State v. Handy, 191 Vt. 311, 44 A.3d 776 (2012).

      1. Constitutionality.

    </h5>
    <p>
     Benefit to small stores was the most crucial of the legislative objectives behind this chapter, stated or otherwise, and that purpose, being selectively beneficial by design and not as a mere incident to its operation, had to be tested by appropriate constitutional standards. State v. Ludlow Supermarkets, Inc., 141 Vt. 261, 448 A.2d 791 (1982).
    </p>
    <p>
     Even accepting the legislative judgment that stated objectives of this chapter, a day of rest and energy conservation, were critical enough to risk some constitutional infringement on Article 7 of the Vermont Constitution, there was no demonstration that those same purposes could not be achieved without this chapter. State v. Ludlow Supermarkets, Inc., 141 Vt. 261, 448 A.2d 791 (1982).
    </p>
    <p>
     Recent legislative history demonstrated that the core purpose of this chapter, confirmed by legislative language, was the special protection of small, locally owned, retail stores, and this chapter was, therefore, invalid under the Constitution of Vermont. State v. Ludlow Supermarkets, Inc., 141 Vt. 261, 448 A.2d 791 (1982).

      </p>
      <p>
       "(a) The events of September 11, 2001 require the State of Vermont to have the legal means to respond to acts of terrorism against its citizens. Although such attacks remain unlikely, Vermont should have the ability to protect the public health and safety of its citizens in state courts under state law in the event that terrorist acts occur here. Vermont will be best able to work with other states and the federal government to efficiently and effectively prosecute these crimes if a statutory scheme is in place criminalizing certain acts of terrorism. A Vermont law will achieve this goal by providing a necessary complement to state and federal laws in the fight against terrorism, and by better protecting all citizens from terrorist acts.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(b) It is not the intent of the General Assembly, however, that this bill in any way infringe on our constitutionally-guaranteed rights, such as the freedoms of speech, religion, assembly and association. Sacrificing these hard-won rights in the name of fighting terrorism would play into the hands of terrorists by compromising the very values we seek to defend.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(c) The Vermont Public Safety Act of 2002 is, therefore, intended to provide the state with tools to protect it and its citizens against terrorism, to allow Vermont to cooperate with other states and the federal government to prevent acts of terrorism, and to achieve these goals without infringing upon the constitutional and civil rights which make both our nation and our state so worth defending."

       In addition to any other civil liability or criminal penalty allowed by law, if a person cuts down, fells, destroys, removes, injures, damages, or carries away any timber placed or growing for any use or purpose whatsoever, or forest products standing, lying, or growing belonging to another person, without permission from the owner of the timber or forest product, or cuts out, alters, or defaces the mark of a log or other valuable forest product, the party injured may recover of such person, in an action on this statute, treble damages for the value of the timber or forest product, and any damage caused to the land or improvements thereon as a result of such action. The injured party or landowner may rely on an assessment of damages based on the kind, condition, location, and use of the timber or forest product by the injured party or landowner, or alternatively, may elect to rely on the values established under section 3602 of this title.

       <p>
        Statute allowing treble damages for conversion of trees did not create a cause of action, but rather allowed cumulative damages for injuries actionable at common law; the statute is based upon trespass. As appellees did not allege that trespass occurred here, the timber statute created no bar to the remedies available to appellants under the common law when appellees' tree encroached upon their property. Alvarez v. Katz, 199 Vt. 510, 124 A.3d 839 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section created no right of action, but only gives cumulative damages for what was, and still is, actionable at common law. Hathaway v. Goslant, 77 Vt. 199, 59 A. 835 (1905); Davenport v. Newton, 71 Vt. 11, 42 A. 1087 (1898); Montgomery v. Edwards, 45 Vt. 75 (1872).

       </h5>
       <p>
        In an action brought by town for unlawful cutting of timber, town was not required to prove that cutting was "without leave"; timber cutters' admission that they cut timber on land found to be owned by town satisfied burden of proof under this section. Town of Wolcott v. Behrend, 147 Vt. 453, 519 A.2d 1156 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although a plaintiff under this section, to be entitled to treble damages, need only prove that the defendant cut timber on the plaintiff's land, the defendant may escape multiple damages if he satisfies the court that he had adequate reason to understand he had title to the area where the cutting was done. Amey v. Hall, 123 Vt. 62, 181 A.2d 69 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        If defendant would reduce damages from treble to single, he must show that he acted through mistake which was not result of his negligence or misconduct, that is, such mistake as a careful and prudent man would ordinarily make under like circumstances; or that he had good reason to believe that timber was on his land, that is, such reason as would lead a man while in the exercise of ordinary care and prudence to so believe. Ripchick v. Pearsons, 118 Vt. 311, 109 A.2d 347 (1954); Davis v. Cotey, 70 Vt. 120, 39 A. 628 (1897).
       </p>
       <p>
        Burden was on defendant to establish defense that he cut timber through mistake or had good reason to believe that he had right to cut it. Parker v. Cone, 104 Vt. 421, 160 A. 246 (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff is only required to prove that defendant cut timber on his land without leave, and on such showing he is entitled to recover treble damages. Davis v. Cotey, 70 Vt. 120, 39 A. 628 (1897).

       </p>
       <p>
        In action brought by town for unlawful cutting of timber, substantial evidence supported trial court's finding on the location of a boundary line, despite presence of credible conflicting evidence, where town introduced expert testimony of land surveyors who relied on deed descriptions and numerous surveys as basis for their opinions as to location of boundary lines. Town of Wolcott v. Behrend, 147 Vt. 453, 519 A.2d 1156 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        In action under this section where parties traced title to common owners, and plaintiff claimed defendant had cut over line, location of which was in dispute, between their respective properties, plan, prepared by experienced surveyor from survey made of lot owned by defendant for one of his predecessors in title, was admissible, in connection with surveyor's testimony as to details of survey, to illustrate his testimony, against defendant's claim that survey was made on wrong division. Thurston v. Batchellor, 100 Vt. 334, 137 A. 199 (1927).
       </p>
       <p>

        In an action brought by a landowner seeking treble damages from defendant for the unlawful cutting of timber, where the trial court's findings, that the defendant told the landowner that he would send her a contract to sign, but never did, and that the defendant attempted to take advantage of the landowner by failing to send her a contract as he agreed, implied that the trial court accepted the landowner's argument that a written contract was a condition precedent to any valid agreement to sell the timber on her land, and, therefore, contradicted the trial court's refusal to award the landowner treble damages under this section "because (plaintiff) did agree to let defendant remove the timber from her lot," the findings were ambiguous and were to be clarified on remand, since only with proper findings on those issues could the supreme court determine whether the provisions of this section had been correctly applied. Fox v. McLain, 142 Vt. 11, 451 A.2d 1122 (1982).

        In action for recovery of treble damages for cutting and removing timber from plaintiffs' farm, where exception to special verdict that corporation's agent in cutting such timber did not do so through mistake or with good reason to believe that he had right to cut it, was not briefed, and judgment for treble damages stands unchallenged in supreme court, such court cannot review and weigh evidence on which special verdict was based. Parker v. Cone, 104 Vt. 421, 160 A. 246 (1932).

       </h5>
       <p>
        By authorizing "a cause of action for damages" against a landowner for failure to mark the harvest unit, it is plain that the Legislature intended to provide for single damages only. The Legislature knew how to authorize treble damages, as evidenced by the first sentence of the timber trespass statute, and had it meant to extend this extra liability to landowners, it could have used the phrase "a cause of action for treble damages; however, it did not do so, and the court presumes it chose its words advisedly. Epsom v. Crandall, 211 Vt. 94, 220 A.3d 1247 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because a landowner's liability for timber trespass was based solely on his failure to mark the harvest unit, the trial court did not err in declining to award treble damages against him. Epsom v. Crandall, 211 Vt. 94, 220 A.3d 1247 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because nothing in the timber trespass statute indicates that the Legislature intended to authorize a broader range of costs than those ordinarily available, the trial court did not err in denying plaintiffs' request for additional costs, including copying, postage, survey fees, and expert fees. Epsom v. Crandall, 211 Vt. 94, 220 A.3d 1247 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        A plaintiff's total damages are computed by determining the value of the trees cut, trebling that figure, and then making any appropriate allowances for remediation or mitigation. State v. Singer, 180 Vt. 104, 904 A.2d 1184 (June 30, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        A plaintiff cannot recover both multiple damages as provided by the statute and punitive damages for the destruction of the trees. State v. Singer, 180 Vt. 104, 904 A.2d 1184 (June 30, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court was entitled to rely on the property owner's testimony as to the replacement value of the two shade trees plaintiffs cut down in calculating damages. Pion v. Bean, 176 Vt. 1, 833 A.2d 1248 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where landowner was liable to adjoining landowner, on the basis of unjust enrichment, for the fair value of wood logger, without right, cut on adjoining landowner's land and paid landowner for, and the value of the wood was found to be $3,000, but there was no evidence as to how much logger paid landowner, the cause would be remanded for determination of the amount paid and a new judgment order in accordance with evidence of amount paid and with instant decision. Masters v. Stone, 134 Vt. 529, 367 A.2d 686 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Difference in the value of the land, before and after the trespass, is not the exclusive measure of damage under this section. Lavalette v. Noyes, 124 Vt. 353, 205 A.2d 413 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        The elements of damage under the section vary with the kind, condition, location and use of the trees damaged. Lavalette v. Noyes, 124 Vt. 353, 205 A.2d 413 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is proper to measure damages under this section by reference to value of the cut timber as marketable logs, together with the cost of removing tops and limbs. Lavalette v. Noyes, 124 Vt. 353, 205 A.2d 413 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        As a general rule where suit is brought to recover damages for injury to realty caused by cutting of trees and recovery of value of the trees as property separate and apart from soil would not give plaintiff his full damage; true measure of damage is difference between value of land before injury and its value immediately thereafter. O'Brien v. Dewey, 120 Vt. 340, 143 A.2d 130 (1958).

        Where the trial court properly established that two trees removed by plaintiffs were on defendants' property and that plaintiffs did not have a good reason to believe that the trees were on their property, the court properly awarded treble damages to defendants. Pion v. Bean, 176 Vt. 1, 833 A.2d 1248 (2003).

        In treble damages action for unlawful cutting of timber, in which defense was that there was an unrecorded timber cutting agreement which had not expired at the time of the sale of the lot and subsequent cutting and that purchasers of the lot had notice of the agreement, finding all parties who knew anything about cutting on the lot, excepting defendant and his people, and including estate trustee who sold the lot out of the estate assets and who had negotiated the cutting agreement, believed the cutting operation was completed, and that there was no notice, was amply supported by the evidence, and judgment for single damages, and injunction against further cutting, would be affirmed. Hudson v. Clark, 136 Vt. 553, 396 A.2d 132 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Liability under this section directed against persons cutting down trees belonging to another extends to one who engages in such activity as a principal, even though he may not have personally felled a tree, but it does not extend to those only secondarily or vicariously involved, and sale of cutting rights to timber on one's own property does not make seller a principal trespasser on the land of another when an independent contractor doing the cutting cuts on the other person's land. Masters v. Stone, 134 Vt. 529, 367 A.2d 686 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where landowner sold logging rights to her land and logger cut on adjoining land and paid seller for the wood cut on the adjoining land, seller was liable to adjoining landowner, on the basis of unjust enrichment, for the fair value of the wood taken. Masters v. Stone, 134 Vt. 529, 367 A.2d 686 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant who engaged in a joint logging operation was liable as a principal for trespass under this section where trees were cut by his joint operator, even though defendant did not actually participate in cutting the trees. Lavalette v. Noyes, 124 Vt. 353, 205 A.2d 413 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where evidence in action under this section for treble damages established that defendant participated in logging operation, though he did not actually cut trees on plaintiff's land, and received one half of the net proceeds from sale of the logs, such evidence was sufficient to establish that defendant was engaged in a joint logging operation with the operator who actually cut the trees on plaintiffs' land. Lavalette v. Noyes, 124 Vt. 353, 205 A.2d 413 (1964).

    rightful possession of such trees.
    If the person interrogated fails to produce a bill of sale or writing showing his or her

        In this section making unlawful property damage an offense and referring, in two subsecs., to "damage to any property which is valued in an amount exceeding" $1000 and $250 respectively, and referring in a third subsec. to "damage to property of any value not exceeding $250.00", the word "value" refers to the amount of damage inflicted, not the value of the property which is damaged. State v. Breznick, 134 Vt. 261, 356 A.2d 540 (1976).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Mid-trial amendment to information raising amount of damage from an amount not exceeding $250 to an amount over $250 violated V.R.Cr.P. 7, prohibiting amendment to information during trial if different offense is charged, since one of essential elements of crime of unlawful mischief was changed. State v. Verge, 152 Vt. 93, 564 A.2d 1353 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unlawful mischief is a specific intent crime. State v. Patch, 145 Vt. 344, 488 A.2d 755 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the legislature has eliminated a previous reference to malicious intent in this section, the supreme court cannot continue to require such an element to sustain a conviction. State v. Patch, 145 Vt. 344, 488 A.2d 755 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The date on which it was committed is not an essential element of offense of intentionally damaging property when the person doing the damage has no right to do so or any reasonable ground to believe he has such a right, and the date need not be specifically proven. State v. Breznick, 134 Vt. 261, 356 A.2d 540 (1976).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Defendant was not entitled to acquittal of reckless endangerment and unlawful mischief, as there was sufficient evidence that he threw a pry bar at a truck when the driver testified that he saw a man in the road holding a large object, which shattered his windshield, there was a divot in the snow where an object apparently bounced off the windshield, police found a pry bar with a broken orange handle inside the home where defendant worked, and the windshield contained orange fragments. State v. Redmond, - Vt.
    - , 234 A.3d 958 (May 15, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jury's decision in defendant landowner's favor on plaintiffs' unlawful mischief claim was supported by the evidence and was not inconsistent with its other findings. The jury could have concluded from the evidence presented that the landowner misunderstood his boundary line or was careless in failing to identify and mark his boundary line before hiring a logger, but that he did not actually intend to have plaintiffs' trees cut; the jury's findings against the landowner on the timber trespass and common-law trespass claims did not automatically make the landowner liable for unlawful mischief. Epsom v. Crandall, 211 Vt. 94, 220 A.3d 1247 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's findings were adequate to show that all elements of the unlawful mischief statute were satisfied, including the intent element. Without a transcript the appellate court could not evaluate whether there was sufficient evidence to support the trial court's findings, and it had to assume the findings were supported. Evans v. Cote, 197 Vt. 523, 107 A.3d 911 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Investigating police officer's unobjected to testimony that he observed victim's station wagon with all four tires slashed, together with defendant's confession, was sufficient proof of ownership of property damaged, in prosecution for intentional damage to property without right, or belief in right, to do so. State v. Breznick, 134 Vt. 261, 356 A.2d 540 (1976).

         5. Bail.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where defendant was charged with felony unlawful mischief under subsec. (a) of this section, that the proof of property damage exceeding $1000 might necessarily involve evidence of violent acts toward the victim was inconsequential for purposes of bail under 13 V.S.A.
        §
        7553a; therefore, the trial court erred as a matter of law in holding defendant without bail. State v. Filippo, 172 Vt. 551, 772 A.2d 531 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an unlawful mischief case where the damages were only $1, the attorney's fee award of $22,406 was reasonable. The trial court had not improperly considered plaintiff's success in obtaining a permanent injunction, but stated that the fee award was related solely to the damages claim, and the trial court had reduced the lodestar figure by 75 percent because of plaintiff's poor outcome on the damages claim. Evans v. Cote, 197 Vt. 523, 107 A.3d 911 (2014).

         6. Attorney's fees.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In the absence of any jury instruction addressing the unlawful-mischief statute, the Court could not conclude that the special verdict form was itself sufficient to establish that the civil unlawful-mischief claim was presented to and considered by the jury. Accordingly, the trial court properly denied defendant's petition for fees. LeBlanc v. Snelgrove, 200 Vt. 570, 133 A.3d 361 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plain language of the unlawful mischief statute indicates that attorney's fees may be awarded even where actual damages are minimal; the statute prohibits causing "any damage to property of any value," and allows recovery of attorney's fees for a "person who suffers damages as a result of a violation." The statute contains no requirement that the actual damages reach a threshold minimum to trigger the award of attorney's fees; as long as there is credible evidence that the defendant's actions caused some damage, it is not necessary to demonstrate an exact value of the damage done. Evans v. Cote, 197 Vt. 523, 107 A.3d 911 (2014).

        Notice of trespass required under 13 V.S.A.
        §
        3705(a) did not violate the due process, equal protection, search and seizure, or free speech provisions of the First, Fourth, and Fourteenth Amendments to the U.S. Constitution because the notice of trespass did not signify criminal conduct, did not give rise to due process protections, and did not prohibit plaintiff from standing on public property to convey his discontent about a deli's unsanitary food handling.

        13 V.S.A.
        §
        3705(a) is not void for vagueness because it clearly prohibits criminal trespass and subjects people to warnings of various forms as a predicate to prosecution. Because there is no uncertainty about the conduct being regulated, and since there is no enforcement taking place, due process does not require standards under a void for vagueness theory.

         2. Definitions.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Nothing in the unlawful trespass statute suggests that places like planes, trains and automobiles are to be excluded from criminal-trespass protection; common sense and the plain language of the statute compel the conclusion that the inside of a car is a "place" for purposes of the statute. Accordingly, there was no merit to defendant's challenge to his unlawful trespass charge, which arose from his refusing to leave his ex-girlfriend's car. State v. Stokes, 194 Vt. 351, 83 A.3d 567 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where statute governing crime of trespass lacked definitions for many of its essential terms, court would assume that statutory terminology was consistent with common law, and would construe statute strictly and in a manner most favorable to accused in order not to create criminal liability outside contemplation of legislature. State v. Dixon, 169 Vt. 15, 725 A.2d 920 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        The terms "licensed" and "privileged" in subsec. (d) of this section are not synonymous; "licensed" refers to a consensual entry while "privileged" refers to a nonconsensual entry. State v. Kreth, 150 Vt. 406, 553 A.2d 554 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mobile home located in trailer park, whether realty or personalty, was a "place" within meaning of trespassing statute defining an element of trespassing as being an entering or remaining "on any land or in any place." State v. Foster, 139 Vt. 18, 421 A.2d 1284 (1980).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Tellingly, the most severe offense in the unlawful trespass statute requires the State to prove a culpable mental state while the less severe offenses do not. The Vermont Supreme Court thus declines to infer a knowledge element in the misdemeanor subsection when the statutory language, history, and framework indicate that it was intentionally omitted. State v. Richards, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (May 28, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont Supreme Court declines to imply a knowledge requirement into the license element of the misdemeanor unlawful trespass provision. Thus, the trial court properly declined to read a knowledge element into the statute and instructed the jury accordingly. State v. Richards, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (May 28, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unlawful trespass statute allows notice of trespass to be given by actual communication or by signs or placards so designed and situated as to give reasonable notice. The statute allows notice to be proven with objective evidence of reasonable notice through signage and without showing that a defendant subjectively saw and understood the signs. State v. Pixley, 208 Vt. 529, 200 A.3d 174 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because it is not mentioned in the statute, proof of ownership is not an element required for an unlawful trespass conviction, so long as lawful possession is established. Therefore, the State's burden was to prove a utility's lawful possession of the land on which defendants were arrested, not the ownership of the land. State v. Gillard, 195 Vt. 259, 88 A.3d 389 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont's criminal trespass statute, based on the Model Penal Code adopted by the American Law Institute in 1962, provides that a trespass is committed only by a person knowing that he is not licensed or privileged to do so; the knowledge requirement excludes from criminal liability both the inadvertent trespasser and the trespasser who believes that he has received express or implied permission to enter or remain on the premises, and thus it is not sufficient for the State to show that defendant should have known that he was not licensed or privileged to enter the dwelling. State v. Fanger, 164 Vt. 48, 665 A.2d 36 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The knowledge requirement of 13 V.S.A.
        §
        3705(d) establishes a subjective standard. State v. Fanger, 164 Vt. 48, 665 A.2d 36 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        At hearing to adjudicate delinquency based on count of unlawful trespass, the trial court was not required to make specific finding that juvenile was on premises "without legal authority" where this element of the offense was not disputed at trial, and even if juvenile's status as personal friend of person entering premises who accompanied that friend to assist him in retrieving personal property was sufficient to give him legal authority to be on the premises, he was divested of authority by owner's request that defendant leave. In re K.B., 155 Vt. 514, 586 A.2d 552 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Information which charged that defendant entered a dwelling house knowing that he was not privileged to do so failed to charge defendant with violating subsec. (d) of this section, because it failed to charge that defendant knew that he was not licensed to enter, an essential element of the crime. State v. Kreth, 150 Vt. 406, 553 A.2d 554 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a nonresidence is involved, this section requires that the normal access to the building be locked, or that certain methods of notice against trespass be employed, and the additional element of proof results in unlawful trespass not being a lesser included offense of burglary. State v. Savo, 139 Vt. 644, 433 A.2d 292 (1981).

        Where defendant pushed open the door while resident was attempting to keep it shut, and in the process knocked over her child, grabbed resident's wrist and twisted it behind her back, and pulled resident's hair, the level of violence undercut defendant's explanation of his conduct as the exercise of a landlord's right to evict a tenant in accordance with the law.

        Where defendant explained his reason for entry into apartment as being to check the heat, and there was evidence negativing that explanation, the inference could be drawn that defendant knew he did not have a license or privilege to enter so that the case should not have been dismissed.

       </p>
       <p>
        State did not meet its burden of proof in showing defendant knew he was not privileged to enter apartment through its offer of defendant's conversation with policeman as evidence to show that defendant knew his actions were unlawful since the officer's affidavit stated only that he advised the defendant of the consequences if he did not abide by the laws without providing any details of the conversation.

        Where a school district issued a notice against trespass barring a parent from school property, the parent's Fourteenth Amendment procedural due process claim failed in part because the parent lacked a liberty interest in accessing school property generally; the procedural due process claim survived in part because the court was unable to conclude that the district provided the parent with adequate process, and the Graham rule did not apply to procedural due process claims.

        Where a school district issued a notice against trespass barring a parent from school property, the parent's First Amendment claim was dismissed as to access to school classrooms because the parent made no claim about access to them; dismissal was not warranted to the extent the parent alleged interference with the parent's speech rights on school property, because the court declined the district's invitation to carve out public school property from the public forum framework.

        When defendants, claiming to have permission of neighboring landowners involved in a dispute with a utility company, entered the disputed property while the utility was engaged in construction work, the trial court did not err in refusing to dismiss the unlawful trespass case against defendants in the interests of justice due to a pending civil suit between the neighbors and the utility. Defendants exposed the utility to substantial harm by purposely interfering with its construction schedule; the court prohibited self-help to further a land claim; and any later determination that the neighbors owned the land would not change the fact that the utility was in lawful possession before such a ruling.

        Service of a "notice against trespass" document on plaintiff protester merely satisfied the "actual communication" element of the offense under (a)(1) (1998), so the issuance of the notice was not a judicial action, thus the judge who issued the notice and the judge and court clerk who requested it were not entitled to absolute immunity for the issuance of the notice in a 42 U.S.C.S.

        As defendant failed to argue at a restitution hearing that unlawful trespass could not be the predicate offense for an award of restitution, such issue was waived for purposes of appellate review; raising the issue in a post-judgment motion was not sufficient. State v. Tetrault, 192 Vt. 616, 54 A.3d 146 (2012), (mem.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Amount of restitution awarded for items that were used or damaged by defendant and defendant's friends was proper where it was based on the replacement value rather than the actual value at the time of the unlawful trespass, as the property owner did not receive a windfall by receiving replacement value for items that did not have a "blue book" value.

Furthermore, the trial court did not direct the jury that it was required to find that defendant had received notice against trespass, but rather provided a clarifying and more detailed description of the "notice against trespass" referred to in its prior sentence.

        In an unlawful trespass case, defendants' requested instructions would have been error, as they would have replaced the statute's emphasis on lawful possession with an emphasis on ownership. The instructions given identified the State's burden of proving lawful possession of the land on which defendants were arrested and also explained the concept of lawful possession. State v.

        Defendant, who entered the complainant's home with the complainant's key, texted her that he had returned to his home in New York, and hid under her bed, was entitled to acquittal of unlawful trespass, as he generally had permission to be in the house when she was not there, and even if his lies about his whereabouts effectively revoked the complainant's consent to his presence there, the statute did not criminalize remaining in a house without permission, only entry.

       <p>
        In the case of defendant charged with grand larceny under section 2501 of this title and breaking and entering in the nighttime with intent to commit larceny, the trial court did not err in failing to instruct the jury that it could find the defendant guilty of the unlawful taking of tangible property as a lesser included offense of grand larceny, since the criminal intent involved in the unlawful taking of tangible property is a different intent than that which is implicated in the crime of grand larceny and the two intents are mutually exclusive, and in order for the defendant to be entitled to jury instruction on a lesser offense than that for which he was charged, the elements of the lesser offense must necessarily have been included within the greater offense.

        All of the weapons listed in the slung shot, blackjack, and brass knuckles statute could be characterized as dangerous weapons and could support prosecution, and lesser penalties, pursuant to the carrying dangerous weapons statute. The Legislature has made the use, or possession with intent to use, of a subset of dangerous weapons subject to potentially more onerous sentences - imprisonment up to five years - than others. State v. Brunner, 196 Vt. 571, 99 A.3d 1019 (June 20, 2014).

         2. Brass knuckles.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Defendant's statement that he had brass knuckles for protection - coupled with the other circumstantial evidence, including that defendant was in his vehicle at night possessing several hundred dollars' worth of marijuana and was parked in front of an apartment building in which he did not live - was sufficient to convince a trier of fact beyond a reasonable doubt that defendant possessed the brass knuckles with the intent to use them. State v. Hale, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (Mar. 26, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Implement possessed by defendant was "brass knuckles" when its shape and construction were such that one section was within the closed grip of the fist when grasped and the remaining portions of the flat metal pieces formed a bar that protruded along in the front of the fingers/knuckles, and when the wearer's hand was protected and the damage inflicted upon the victim increased by 17 sharply serrated teeth. State v. Brunner, 196 Vt. 571, 99 A.3d 1019 (June 20, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Brass knuckles statute is not limited to instruments that may reasonably be used for other purposes when it is apparent they are also designed to augment a punch, any more than it is limited to only those weapons made of brass. That does not mean people can be convicted for possessing implements to be used solely for lawful purposes; the statute requires that an individual possess brass knuckles or a similar weapon "with intent so to use it." State v. Brunner, 196 Vt. 571, 99 A.3d 1019 (June 20, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        That the brass knuckles statute applies to a range of weapons that may have distinct characteristics but share the common elements of brass knuckles does not make the statute ambiguous, just as the use of "firearm," which includes "pistol, revolver, gun, machine gun or shotgun" does not render a statute ambiguous. State v. Brunner, 196 Vt. 571, 99 A.3d 1019 (June 20, 2014).

       <p>
        In prohibiting possession with the intent to use, the legislature was not concerned with how imminently a person intends to use brass knuckles and similar weapons. Other possession statutes, as well as the language and structure of the statute governing use or possession of brass knuckles and similar weapons, indicate that the legislature was concerned with the inherent dangers posed by brass knuckles and similar weapons when a person merely possesses them with the intent to use, whether presently or in the future.

       <p>
        In prosecution for carrying a weapon during the commission of a felony, the state need not show that defendant knowingly carried the weapon. State v. Carter, 156 Vt. 437, 593 A.2d 88 (1991).

        This section does not contain any language which expressly requires knowledge. State v. Kerr, 143 Vt. 597, 470 A.2d 670 (1983).

       <p>
        In the case of defendant convicted of violating this section where the handgun which gave rise to the charges was contained in the bag, trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal, made on the ground that the state presented no evidence that defendant knew that the bag contained a handgun, since the element of scienter is not a part of this section and an unexpressed legislative intent to include knowledge could not be found by implication. State v. Kerr, 143 Vt. 597, 470 A.2d 670 (1983).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for carrying a deadly weapon during commission of a crime the state must show a relationship between the carrying of the weapon and the underlying felony, and it is sufficient if the state shows that the weapon had the potential to facilitate the commission of the underlying felony. State v. Carter, 156 Vt. 437, 593 A.2d 88 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        On appeal for conviction of carrying a weapon during commission of a felony, defendant was not entitled to a judgment of acquittal where a sufficient relationship was shown between carrying the weapon and the underlying felony, that being that defendant had loaded his pistol the night before the burglary and had it in his pocket during the burglary, since it is patent that a weapon has the potential of facilitating a burglary. State v. Carter, 156 Vt. 437, 593 A.2d 88 (1991).

        Model Penal Code provision adopted in 1972, providing that a person is guilty of simple assault if he negligently causes bodily injury to another with a deadly weapon, and 1931 law intended to encourage hunters to be careful and providing that one carelessly or negligently wounding another by gunshot shall be imprisoned or fined, cannot logically stand together, for while the former is a misdemeanor and the latter a felony, the latter requires a less culpable state of mind; therefore, the former would be held to repeal the latter by implication.

        Adoption in 1972 of Model Penal Code provisions relating to assault, including provision that a person is guilty of simple assault if he negligently causes bodily injury to another with a deadly weapon, repealed by implication 1931 law intended to encourage hunters to be careful and providing that one carelessly or negligently wounding another by gunshot shall be imprisoned or fined, for it is evident that both statutes cover the same subject and in such a case the statute which is the more recent will control, as it is the latest expression of the legislative will.

         Use of the imperative "shall" throughout the statute of limitations for certain felonies operates as a mandate requiring the State to file charges and commence prosecution for a given crime within the associated period. The court understands the "prosecution" to be "commenced" at: (1) the arrest of the defendant without warrant; (2) the issuance to him by a law enforcement or prosecuting officer of a citation to appear; or (3) the presentation of an information or indictment to a judicial officer for the purpose of obtaining a summons or arrest warrant. In re Jones, 187 Vt. 1, 989 A.2d 482 (2009).
        </p>
        <p>
         Current language of the statute pertaining to proceedings begun after time limitation makes plain that when the State commences a prosecution after the time period laid out in the statute of limitations for certain felonies, "such proceedings shall be void"; by using "shall" and providing a remedy for the violation of the time limitation, the legislature made clear that the statute pertaining to proceedings begun after time limitation, like its sister statute, is mandatory. This language renders a criminal complaint void and of no effect when the limitations period has run; accordingly, all criminal prosecution proceedings are void when the applicable statute of limitations for the charged crime has run. In re Jones, 187 Vt. 1, 989 A.2d 482 (2009).

         In an application for postconviction relief, the underlying crime occurred in February 1997, but the State did not bring charges of unlawful restraint and burglary until the crime was more than a decade old. Because petitioner pleaded guilty to offenses for which there could be no judgment of conviction, his plea agreement and sentencing were void even though he had waived the statute of limitations. In re Jones, 187 Vt. 1, 989 A.2d 482 (2009).

         State could not prosecute defendant for misdemeanor possession of marijuana following reversal of his conviction for felony possession; defendant had never been charged with misdemeanor possession, misdemeanor possession was not a lesser-included offense of felony possession, and three-year statute of limitations for misdemeanors had run.

        <p>
         Vermont has no statute of limitations for the prosecution of murder, but the statute of limitations is not the sole measure of whether a prosecution is timely; a defendant may successfully avoid prosecution if the preindictment delay violated defendant's due process rights and prosecution will also be barred where the delay violates those fundamental conceptions of justice which lie at the base of our civil and political institutions and which define the community's sense of fair play and decency; in making this inquiry, courts should consider the reasons for the delay and the actual prejudice to the defendant. State v. Delisle, 162 Vt. 293, 648 A.2d 632 (1994).
        </p>

         This section, requiring that a prosecution be commenced within three years, requires simply the presentation of an information or indictment; the section does not require the presentation of a valid indictment or information. State v. Stewart, 140 Vt. 389, 438 A.2d 671 (1981).

         Six-year statute of limitations for lewd and lascivious conduct cases applied retroactively to defendant's conduct for which the prior statute of limitations had not run at time of amendment, so that statute governed offenses charged, even though they occurred before amendment date.

         Extension of statute of limitations for crime of lewd and lascivious conduct with a child before original period of limitation had run was not ex post facto law in violation of state or federal constitution. State v. Johnson, 158 Vt. 344, 612 A.2d 1114 (1992).
        </p>
        <p>
         Extension of statute of limitations for crime of lewd and lascivious conduct with a child before original period of limitation had run did not violate due process because lengthening limitation periods does not enlarge an offense by changing its elements or increasing its punishment and it did not alter well-established law. State v. Johnson, 158 Vt. 344, 612 A.2d 1114 (1992).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where three-year statute of limitation for crime of sexual assault had not run at time legislature extended limitation period from three to six years, defendant did not acquire at time of alleged offense a right to original limitation period, and six-year statute of limitation was retroactively applicable. State v. Petrucelli, 156 Vt. 382, 592 A.2d 365 (1991).

          5. Tolling of statute of limitations.
         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         Where indictments in prosecutions for embezzlement put defendants on notice as to the crimes with which they were being charged by stating, at the very least, what statutes were violated, when they were violated, and what acts of the defendants resulted in the violation, subsequent dismissal of the indictment as being too vague to constitutionally support a prosecution did not render the indictment so vague that it did not satisfy the purposes of the statute of limitations and failed to toll the statute of limitations. State v. Stewart, 140 Vt. 389, 438 A.2d 671 (1981).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where defendant was charged with embezzlement for acts committed before November 1, 1977, in both a February 26, 1980, indictment and a November 4, 1980, information, the earlier indictment put the defendant on notice as to the crime with which he was being charged and tolled the statute of limitations from the time it was brought until it was dismissed on October 30, 1980, and thus the subsequent information was filed well before the three-year statute of limitations for embezzlement had run. State v. Stewart, 140 Vt. 389, 438 A.2d 671 (1981).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where defendant was charged with aiding in the commission of the felony of embezzlement for acts committed before November 1, 1977, in a February 26, 1980, indictment and was charged with alternative charges of aiding in the commission of embezzlement and embezzlement in an information filed on November 4, 1980, the earlier indictment put the defendant on notice as to the charge of aiding in the commission of embezzlement only and the statute of limitations as to the alternative charge of embezzlement was not tolled by the prior indictment and thus the alternative charge in the subsequent information should have been dismissed by the trial court since the three-year statute of limitations for embezzlement had run as to that charge. State v. Stewart, 140 Vt. 389, 438 A.2d 671 (1981).

         Where prior to 1981 prosecutions for arson were exempted from this section and in 1981 this section was amended to exempt only arson causing death, since the legislature first enumerated the degrees of arson in 1935, if the legislature had intended to amend this section in 1935 so that it addressed the degrees of arson enacted that year also, it presumably would have done so; therefore, the intent of the legislature in maintaining the pre-1981 wording of this section was that all degrees of arson were included herein.

         Accessory to felony charge is not a separate and distinct "other felony" for purposes of the three-year statute of limitations, as it is not wholly divorced from the principal crime to which the person is allegedly an accessory. In re Hyde, 200 Vt. 103, 129 A.3d 651 (2015).
        </p>
        <p>
         State's prosecution of defendant as an accessory to commit sexual assault on a child under the age of 16 was within the statute of limitations. Assuming arguendo that the limitations period could be triggered by the commission of the acts, as opposed to the later reporting of those acts, the limitations period began with the last alleged instance of defendant's aiding and abetting a friend to sexually molest defendant's daughter; either under the original charge against defendant or the amended charge to which she pled, the State's prosecution was within the statute of limitations. In re Hyde, 200 Vt. 103, 129 A.3d 651 (2015).

         Accessory felony charges are categorized alongside their underlying principal felonies for purposes of the statute of limitations. In re Hyde, 200 Vt. 103, 129 A.3d 651 (2015).

         There was no merit to the pro se defendant's argument that his prosecution for aggravated sexual assault was time-barred.

         Statute of limitations begins to run from the commission of the offense, and not from its discovery. Vaughn v. Congdon, 56 Vt. 111 (1883).

         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         Current language of the statute pertaining to proceedings begun after time limitation makes plain that when the State commences a prosecution after the time period laid out in the statute of limitations for certain felonies, "such proceedings shall be void"; by using "shall" and providing a remedy for the violation of the time limitation, the legislature made clear that the statute pertaining to proceedings begun after time limitation, like its sister statute, is mandatory. This language renders a criminal complaint void and of no effect when the limitations period has run; accordingly, all criminal prosecution proceedings are void when the applicable statute of limitations for the charged crime has run. In re Jones, 187 Vt. 1, 989 A.2d 482 (2009).
        </p>
        <p>
         In an application for postconviction relief, the underlying crime occurred in February 1997, but the State did not bring charges of unlawful restraint and burglary until the crime was more than a decade old. Because petitioner pleaded guilty to offenses for which there could be no judgment of conviction, his plea agreement and sentencing were void even though he had waived the statute of limitations. In re Jones, 187 Vt. 1, 989 A.2d 482 (2009).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where warrant was issued on complaint exhibited Nov. 12, 1880, charging theft committed Sept. 20, 1874, the complaint was void, since it showed on its face that the statute of limitations had run, and justice of the peace had no jurisdiction of the process and was liable for false imprisonment.

         Use of the imperative "shall" throughout the statute of limitations for certain felonies operates as a mandate requiring the State to file charges and commence prosecution for a given crime within the associated period. The court understands the "prosecution" to be "commenced" at: (1) the arrest of the defendant without warrant; (2) the issuance to him by a law enforcement or prosecuting officer of a citation to appear; or (3) the presentation of an information or indictment to a judicial officer for the purpose of obtaining a summons or arrest warrant.

         The legislative intent in the use of the words "under his official signature" was not as to the place where the minute should appear, but rather, that the clerk or magistrate attest to or warrant the minute as having been the time when the information and warrant were exhibited to him, and defendant was thus not entitled to dismissal of the information and complaint by reason of the placement of the minute above the signature of the clerk.

         Respondent in criminal prosecution, by first submitting to trial on merits without moving to dismiss under

         Where indictments in prosecutions for embezzlement put defendants on notice as to the crimes with which they were being charged by stating, at the very least, what statutes were violated, when they were violated, and what acts of the defendants resulted in the violation, subsequent dismissal of the indictment as being too vague to constitutionally support a prosecution did not render the indictment so vague that it did not satisfy the purposes of the statute of limitations and failed to toll the statute of limitations.

         Objection founded on want of minute required by this section must be made at first term of court to which writ is returnable, and before pleading to merits, and if not so made it will be out of time. Hill v. Morey, 26 Vt. 178 (1854).

         Motion to dismiss under
         §
         4510 of this title for want of proper minute must be regarded in nature of a plea in abatement, and, if not made at the time, and agreeably to rules of court governing dilatory pleas, will be considered as waived. Pollard v. Wilder, 17 Vt. 48 (1843).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where default judgment by justice was reversed and set aside, and action entered in county court, in the absence of any order prohibiting dilatory defenses, defendant might then interpose motion to dismiss action because magistrate signing writ did not enter thereon minute required by this section.

         The legislative intent in the use of the words "under his official signature" in
         §
         4508 of this title, was not as to the place where the minute should appear, but rather, that the clerk or magistrate attest to or warrant the minute as having been the time when the information and warrant were exhibited to him, and defendant was thus not entitled to dismissal of the information and complaint by reason of the placement of the minute above the signature of the clerk.

      The Supreme Court may by rule provide for change of venue in criminal prosecutions upon motion, for the prevention of prejudice to the defendant or for the convenience of parties and witnesses and in the interests of justice. The court to which a prosecution is transferred shall thereby have jurisdiction of the cause, and the same proceedings shall be had therein as though the venue had not been changed.

        Doctrine of common law that court possesses inherent power to change venue of cause pending before it when it appears necessary to procure fair and impartial trial, and that statutes which specifically confer this power are merely declaratory of common law, does not obtain in Vermont, where the matter is governed by this subchapter. State v. Stacy, 104 Vt. 379, 160 A. 257 (1932).

        County court has no power to grant motion for change of venue, but application must be made to superior judge, and granting thereof is matter of discretion of judge to whom application is made. State v. Stacy, 104 Vt. 379, 160 A. 257 (1932).

       <p>
        Trial court's judgment as to whether reporting of homicide was inflammatory or denunciatory would be given great weight, and its appraisal of the community temper, as affected by the passage of time between the homicide and the trial, and the nature and measure of the public outcry, as it affected the prospects of a fair trial, would be given high acceptance by supreme court. State v. Barrett, 128 Vt. 458, 266 A.2d 441 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Application for change of venue under this section is addressed to discretion of presiding judge. State v. Truman, 124 Vt. 285, 204 A.2d 93 (1964).

        Denial of motion for change of venue will not be revised unless abuse of discretion is shown. State v. Truman, 124 Vt. 285, 204 A.2d 93 (1964).

        Ruling of superior judge on motion for change of venue, being discretionary, will not be revised unless abuse of discretion is shown, and test is whether discretion was exercised on grounds or for reasons clearly untenable, or to extent clearly unreasonable.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Supreme court had power to transfer venue of criminal trial after assistant judge, who was disqualified by presiding judge for alleged improper action with respect to an interlocutory appeal, filed a petition in supreme court challenging disqualification. State v. Hunt, 150 Vt. 483, 555 A.2d 369 (1988), cert. denied, 489 U.S. 1026, 109 S. Ct. 1155, 103 L. Ed. 2d 214 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Newspaper articles, even though denunciatory in character, are not in themselves, in absence of some evidence of the actual existence of a prejudice against accused, sufficient to require a conclusion that a fair and impartial trial cannot be had as a discretionary ruling. State v. Truman, 124 Vt. 285, 204 A.2d 93 (1964); State v. Watson, 114 Vt. 543, 49 A.2d 174 (1946); State v. Stacy, 104 Vt. 379, 160 A. 257 (1932).

       <p>
        That no answer or counter affidavit was filed by state did not oblige judge to adopt inferences and opinions contained in respondent's unverified motion for change of venue, or to treat allegations as sufficiently proved, and motion was not evidence of matters recited in it. State v. Stacy, 104 Vt. 379, 160 A. 257 (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of respondent's unverified motion for change of venue was not abuse of discretion where no supporting affidavit was filed with motion, no request made that testimony should be taken, and basis thereof was two newspaper articles stating that respondent had offered to plead guilty to murder in second degree but that state refused to accept plea. State v. Stacy, 104 Vt. 379, 160 A. 257 (1932).

       <p>
        There is no impediment under article 10 of chapter I of the Vermont Constitution to requiring the defendant in a criminal case to prove his insanity where he intends to rely upon a defense of insanity to excuse his conduct. State v. Messier, 145 Vt. 622, 497 A.2d 740 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the state proves every element of the crime charged, subsec. (b) of this section, placing the burden of proving insanity upon the defendant as an affirmative defense, is constitutional. State v. Messier, 145 Vt. 622, 497 A.2d 740 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The possibility that, in a particular case where the defendant relies on the defense of insanity, failure of the trial court to correctly allocate the burden of proof as to the defendant's mental state could result in a violation of the defendant's constitutional right to have all the elements of the offense proved beyond a reasonable doubt, does not invalidate subsec. (b) placing the burden of proving insanity upon the defendant as an affirmative defense. State v. Messier, 145 Vt. 622, 497 A.2d 740 (1985).

        Diminished capacity due either to voluntary intoxication, or to a mental disability can mitigate murder to voluntary manslaughter. State v. Sexton, 180 Vt. 34, 904 A.2d 1092 (June 9, 2006), overruled in part by State v. Congress, 2014 Vt. LEXIS 135 (Vt. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was entitled to present evidence that his diminished capacity, due either to voluntary intoxication or mental disability, prevented him from forming the specific intent to commit second-degree murder. State v. Sexton, 180 Vt. 34, 904 A.2d 1092 (June 9, 2006), overruled in part by State v. Congress, 2014 Vt. LEXIS 135 (Vt. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Language of subsec. (b) of this section, placing the burden of proving insanity upon the defendant "as an affirmative defense," demonstrates an intent by the legislature to eliminate sanity as an essential element of crime. State v. Messier, 145 Vt. 622, 497 A.2d 740 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        In placing the burden of proving insanity upon the defendant "as an affirmative defense," legislature was not required to use words which expressly eliminate sanity as an essential element of crime where its language is consistent with any other interpretation. State v. Messier, 145 Vt. 622, 497 A.2d 740 (1985).

       <p>
        Being adjudged incompetent for trial under Title 13 does not carry the same stigma as being adjudicated mentally ill under Title 18, or of being ordered involuntarily committed under either statute. In itself, a court's competency determination is not sufficient to overcome mootness. State v. Curry, 186 Vt. 623, 987 A.2d 265 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        A defendant may have been insane at the time of the alleged offense under subsec. (a) of this section, and yet not be a person in need of treatment, as defined in section 7101 of Title 18. State v. Clarke, 145 Vt. 547, 496 A.2d 164 (1985).

        Insanity is not an affirmative defense, it is a means of meeting the case made by the prosecution and weakening one of its essentials; beyond this it need not go. State v. Bishop, 128 Vt. 221, 260 A.2d 393 (1969).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        If in the context of a particular case the evidence offered to prove insanity also relates to the defendant's state of mind, which remains an essential element to be proved beyond a reasonable doubt by the state, subsec. (b) of this section, placing the burden of proving insanity upon the defendant as an affirmative defense, cannot operate to relieve the state of its burden. State v. Messier, 145 Vt. 622, 497 A.2d 740 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        When evidence in a criminal prosecution appears to indicate that defendant did not possess the requisite mental capacity to make him criminally responsible, it becomes the duty of the prosecution to establish defendant's sanity as an essential ingredient of the crime. State v. Miner, 128 Vt. 55, 258 A.2d 815 (1969); State v. Bishop, 128 Vt. 221, 260 A.2d 393 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, after prosecution rested in murder trial without presenting evidence that defendant was sane at the time of the offense, defendant moved for a directed verdict for, among other things, failure of the prosecution to sustain its burden of proof on the sanity issue, and state witnesses had given evidence that defendant's appearance and conduct after victim's death was strange, state's request to reopen its case to present evidence on the issue was properly granted. State v. Miner, 128 Vt. 55, 258 A.2d 815 (1969).

         7. Admissibility of evidence.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        It is contrary to intent and purpose of this section's provision stating when mental disease or defect is a defense in criminal cases to allow evidence of previous episodes of violent behavior but rule out evidence intended to relate the previous episodes to some mental disease or defect. State v. Smith, 136 Vt. 520, 396 A.2d 126 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Testimony of witness who saw defendant on same day as, and after, death of defendant's wife, that defendant was "out of his mind," was insubstantial, but had competent bearing on the mental condition of defendant, who was charged with murder of his wife, within the witness' observation and during the time under inquiry. State v. Miner, 128 Vt. 55, 258 A.2d 815 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Considerable latitude is allowed by the courts in admitting evidence which has a tendency to throw light on the mental condition of a defendant at the time of the commission of the crime, provided the proof tends to prove or disprove the issue involved. State v. Bishop, 128 Vt. 221, 260 A.2d 393 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whenever an individual's sanity is in issue, witnesses other than experts or professionals may relate their personal observations of the individual so far as those observations tend to throw light upon the issue. State v. Bishop, 128 Vt. 221, 260 A.2d 393 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        A nonexpert witness may give his opinion as to the sanity of another when based upon conversations or dealings he has had with such person or his appearance or any fact bearing on his mental condition if he has first testified to such conversations, dealings, appearance or other observed facts as the basis for his opinion. State v. Bishop, 128 Vt. 221, 260 A.2d 393 (1969).

       </h5>
       <p>
        In prosecution in which defendant relied on the defense of insanity, where state called a psychiatrist who testified that the defendant had a personality disorder with episodes of depressive experience, that defendant was legally sane as defined in state statutes on the night of the alleged crimes, and that defendant appreciated the criminality of his conduct and was capable of conforming his conduct to the requirements of the law, the jury had evidence from which it could have concluded that the defendant did not lack adequate capacity either to appreciate the criminality of his conduct or to conform his conduct to the requirements of law at the time of the offense. State v. Smith, 140 Vt. 247, 437 A.2d 1093 (1981).
       </p>

        Standard to be followed in passing upon contention that trial court erred in denying motion for new trial, made on ground that verdict of guilty of larceny was contrary to evidence of insanity, was whether there was evidence such that the jury could find beyond a reasonable doubt that the appellant was sane at the time of the commission of the offense. State v. Hanson, 134 Vt. 227, 356 A.2d 517 (1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Though it is for the court to judge in the first instance whether a witness introduced as an expert possesses sufficient skill to entitle him to give an opinion, it is for the jury to determine, from the testimony, whether the expert has sufficient skill to render the opinion of any importance. State v. Bishop, 128 Vt. 221, 260 A.2d 393 (1969).

        Whether evidence pointing to defendant's sanity was sufficient to outweigh beyond a reasonable doubt the evidence pointing to defendant's insanity was for the jury. State v. Bishop, 128 Vt. 221, 260 A.2d 393 (1969).

       <p>
        The finding by a court, after a hearing to determine whether a defendant who relies on insanity as a defense is in need of treatment and should be hospitalized, that the defendant is a person in need of treatment, is not relevant to whether the defendant was insane at the time of the alleged offense; therefore, such an order of commitment cannot serve as the basis for dismissal of a criminal charge. State v. Clarke, 145 Vt. 547, 496 A.2d 164 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Finding by court at hospitalization hearing that defendant was insane at the time of the alleged offense was a nullity, since the issue was not before the court, and the court had no authority to make a finding on that issue. State v. Clarke, 145 Vt. 547, 496 A.2d 164 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Dismissal of charges against defendant on the grounds that hospitalization order had previously established that defendant was insane at the time of the alleged offense was error. State v. Clarke, 145 Vt. 547, 496 A.2d 164 (1985).

        Instruction essentially positing that when the voluntary use of illegal drugs activates a "latent" mental illness resulting in psychosis did not set forth a correct statement of the insanity defense under this section. State v. Sexton, 180 Vt. 34, 904 A.2d 1092 (June 9, 2006), overruled in part by State v. Congress, 2014 Vt. LEXIS 135 (Vt. 2014).

       <p>
        In prosecution in which defendant relied upon defense of insanity and in which evidence concerning defendant's past criminal conduct had been introduced, instructions of trial judge, which incorporated text of this section, including "caveat paragraph" providing that mental disease or defect do not include an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise antisocial conduct, were not so complicated and confusing as to deprive defendant of a fair trial. State v. Smith, 140 Vt. 247, 437 A.2d 1093 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        In larceny prosecution defended against on ground of insanity, instruction that the term mental disease or defect does not include an abnormality manifested by repeated criminal or other anti-social conduct and that if the only evidence of mental disease was a pattern of anti-social behavior a verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity could not be returned was erroneous as likely to confuse the jury, and required reversal, where this section used the words "an abnormality manifested only by repeated criminal or otherwise ant-social conduct", and the court had left out the word "only", and where there was agreed-upon evidence that defendant suffered from a traumatically induced mental disease, which resulted in substantial organic damage to the brain, and court had left out statute's provision that "the terms 'mental disease or defect' shall include congenital and traumatic mental conditions as well as disease".

         13. Long-term drug or alcohol abuse.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        To retain any moral or legal salience, the settled insanity doctrine must - if it is ever justified - be limited to those cases where the initial choice to abuse alcohol or drugs has become so attenuated over time that it serves little or no purpose to hold the defendant accountable for that choice once a permanent mental illness has taken hold through years of chronic substance abuse. State v. Sexton, 180 Vt. 34, 904 A.2d 1092 (June 9, 2006), overruled in part by State v. Congress, 2014 Vt. LEXIS 135 (Vt. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Instruction essentially positing that when the voluntary use of illegal drugs activates a "latent" mental illness resulting in psychosis, the fact that illegal drugs were the precipitating cause should be ignored, runs counter to the fundamental principle that a defendant is not excused from criminal liability for acts which result from a mental state that is self-induced through the voluntary ingestion of illegal drugs or alcohol. State v. Sexton, 180 Vt. 34, 904 A.2d 1092 (June 9, 2006), overruled in part by State v. Congress, 2014 Vt. LEXIS 135 (Vt. 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if defendant suffered from a latent mental illness, it did not alter the fact that he would not have been in a psychotic state at the time of the offense had he not chosen to use illegal consciousness-altering drugs. Thus, the very evidence on which defendant relied defeated his claim, for it demonstrated that his recent, voluntary use of illegal drugs was an essential causal element of the mental illness and psychotic episode that followed. On these facts, defendant was not entitled to assert an insanity defense. State v. Sexton, 180 Vt. 34, 904 A.2d 1092 (June 9, 2006), overruled in part by State v. Congress, 2014 Vt. LEXIS 135 (Vt. 2014).

         1. Right to counsel.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        A proceeding to determine whether an accused should be examined by a psychiatrist and, if so, whether he should be committed to the state hospital for such examination, is a stage of the proceedings at which a needy person is entitled to the appointment of counsel. State v. Spear, 142 Vt. 547, 458 A.2d 1098 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where at arraignment of needy defendant on charge of disorderly conduct the court ordered that defendant be committed to the state hospital for 60 days of psychiatric examination to determine whether he was competent to stand trial, whether he was insane at the time of the offense, and whether he had the mental state required for the offense, defendant was entitled to the appointment of counsel at the arraignment, and the failure of the trial court to appoint a public defender constituted reversible error. State v. Spear, 142 Vt. 547, 458 A.2d 1098 (1983).

         2. Authority of court.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Under subdiv. (a)(3) of this section, if the court believes there is doubt as to defendant's sanity, it has the authority to order a sanity examination of defendant regardless of whether the defendant has raised an insanity defense. State v. Bushey, 147 Vt. 140, 513 A.2d 1177 (1986).

         3. Discretion of court.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court was not precluded from ordering a competency evaluation before final judgment, although was not required to do so. State v. Merchant, 173 Vt. 249, 790 A.2d 386 (2001).

         4. Evidence of incompetency.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The mere assertion on defendant's part that he was in a state of shock was insufficient to establish incompetency, particularly in light of the weight of the evidence indicating that he was competent; therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it found the evidence unconvincing and denied the motion for a mental health screening and a competency evaluation. State v. Merchant, 173 Vt. 249, 790 A.2d 386 (2001).

         5. Evaluation by State's expert.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        State may not compel a defendant to submit to a competency evaluation conducted by a mental health expert of the State's choosing, following a court-ordered competency evaluation by a neutral mental health expert. Therefore, the trial court erred in ordering defendant to submit to a competency evaluation conducted by the State's expert. State v. Sharrow, 205 Vt. 300, 175 A.3d 504 (Aug. 25, 2017).

        Reading of this section in its entirety confirms that the trial court's decision to order an initial mental health screening is discretionary, not mandatory. State v. Merchant, 173 Vt. 249, 790 A.2d 386 (2001).

       <p>
        A proceeding to determine whether an accused should be examined by a psychiatrist and, if so, whether he should be committed to the state hospital for such examination, is a stage of the proceedings at which a needy person is entitled to the appointment of counsel. State v. Spear, 142 Vt. 547, 458 A.2d 1098 (1983). (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Where at arraignment of needy defendant on charge of disorderly conduct the court ordered that defendant be committed to the state hospital for 60 days of psychiatric examination to determine whether he was competent to stand trial, whether he was insane at the time of the offense, and whether he had the mental state required for the offense, defendant was entitled to the appointment of counsel at the arraignment, and the failure of the trial court to appoint a public defender constituted reversible error. State v. Spear, 142 Vt. 547, 458 A.2d 1098 (1983). (Decided under prior law.)

         3. Evidence of incompetency.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The mere assertion on defendant's part that he was in a state of shock was insufficient to establish incompetency, particularly in light of the weight of the evidence indicating that he was competent; therefore, the trial court did not abuse its discretion when it found the evidence unconvincing and denied the motion for a mental health screening and a competency evaluation. State v. Merchant, 173 Vt. 249, 790 A.2d 386 (2001).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Defendant's appeal from decisions finding him incompetent to stand trial and requiring hospitalization for psychiatric examination before a final competency hearing was moot, as he was no longer in custody and the charges had been dismissed. The stigma of temporary commitment did not overcome the mootness bar, and the "capable of repetition" exception to mootness did not apply because there was no prior history of the State of Vermont's involvement with defendant's mental health. State v. Curry, 186 Vt. 623, 987 A.2d 265 (2009).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Purpose of provision of this section that statements made by an examined person during examination are not admissible in criminal proceedings to prove commission of an offense or for impeachment purposes is to promote objective examination by removing the danger that an accused's communications to a psychiatrist during testing will be used as evidence of guilt under the protection of the sanity issue. State v. Miner, 128 Vt. 55, 258 A.2d 815 (1969).

        Expert medical witnesses' recounting of defendant's statements made in course of their psychiatric examination of him in regard to issues of premeditation and malice were inadmissible in prosecution for first-degree murder. State v. Lapham, 135 Vt. 393, 377 A.2d 249 (1977).

       <p>
        Where facts elicited by doctor were not incriminating and did not tend to establish, in any way, the truth or falsity of the charge laid against the respondent, but rather, were essential ingredients in the full evaluation of the issue of respondent's sanity, or lack of it, reception of such testimony was not error. State v. Oakes, 129 Vt. 241, 276 A.2d 18, cert. denied, 404 U.S. 965, 92 S. Ct. 340, 30 L. Ed. 2d 285 (1971).

         4. Competency reports
        </b>
        .
       </h5>
       <p>
        While, by its language, the statute governing competency evaluations contemplates that some portions of a competency report might not be relevant, and thus not required to be admitted, it does not suggest that any other application of "relevance" should be used in considering what portions of a competency report are relevant for competency purposes other than that which is set forth in the Vermont Rules of Evidence, the test for relevancy in Vermont courts. State v. Gotavaskas, 200 Vt. 597, 134 A.3d 536 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the trial court in sealing certain portions of competency reports prepared in connection with court-ordered competency evaluations did not apply the relevancy considerations required by the Vermont Rules of Evidence, it was necessary to remand the cases so that the proper findings could be made. State v. Gotavaskas, 200 Vt. 597, 134 A.3d 536 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Balance between what is publicly accessible and what is not in terms of competency evaluations has been clearly stated in the statute governing competency evaluations and the Rules for Public Access to Court Records; relevant portions of competency evaluations shall be admitted and admitted portions of competency evaluations are public unless redacted. State v. Gotavaskas, 200 Vt. 597, 134 A.3d 536 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the trial court ordered a competency evaluation of defendant pursuant to statute, and the psychiatrist sent the resulting report to the court, state law required the competency report to be admitted into evidence, and the court, for all practical purposes, admitted the report into evidence, relying upon the report's findings and conclusions in determining that it would accept the parties' stipulation of defendant's competency. Therefore, the competency report was not covered by the exception to the rule that case records are open to the public and was accessible to the public. State v. Whitney, 178 Vt. 435, 885 A.2d 1200 (August 19, 2005).

        There is nothing improper about a further examination of one committed for observation, with respect to competency to stand trial, performed by the same psychiatrist who had examined him to determine if he was legally sane. State v. Oakes, 129 Vt. 241, 276 A.2d 18, cert. denied, 404 U.S. 965, 92 S. Ct. 340, 30 L. Ed. 2d 285 (1971).

         2. Purpose.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The purpose of this section is to prevent the trial of a defendant who is not competent to stand trial, and in carrying out that purpose, to resolve any disputes about competency through an adversarial hearing. In re Hanson, 160 Vt. 111, 623 A.2d 466 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        The clear import of subsecs. (a) and (b) of this section is that competency is to be established before further proceedings, guaranteeing a competent defendant the right to consult with his own lawyer, and guaranteeing that incompetent defendants will not be tried, and that they will be properly represented at any subsequent hospitalization hearing. State v. Hackett, 141 Vt. 223, 446 A.2d 369 (1982).

         3. Hearing.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Defendant was denied the opportunity for an adversarial hearing on his competency in two distinct ways. First, he had no opportunity to hear or confront the evidence the trial judge obtained from her ex parte investigations; second, once the judge determined that a hearing was necessary and placed the transporting officers on the stand to testify, she was obligated to provide defendant with an opportunity to respond and present evidence. State v. Gokey, 188 Vt. 500, 14 A.3d 243 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's decision to absent himself from the courtroom during the victim's testimony, his uncooperativeness with his attorney, and his refusal to speak with the mental health screener did not, when combined with the competency findings of the psychiatrist who examined defendant before trial, create reasonable grounds to doubt defendant's competency, and the trial court did not err by refusing to order an additional competency examination or by refusing to hold a competency hearing. State v. Davis, 165 Vt. 240, 683 A.2d 1 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court was not required to conduct competency hearing where there was no question that neither state nor defendant sought to pursue issue of competency after series of examinations by psychiatrist, who reported to court that he believed defendant was competent to stand trial. State v. Ploof, 162 Vt. 560, 649 A.2d 774 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a party raises competency and then fails to pursue the issue, the court must conduct a hearing only if it is not satisfied that the issue about defendant's competency to stand trial was adequately resolved. In re Hanson, 160 Vt. 111, 623 A.2d 466 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court was not required to hold a competency hearing when defendant, with advice of counsel, waived it by not asking for one. In re Hanson, 160 Vt. 111, 623 A.2d 466 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court was not required to hold an evidentiary hearing on competency where the initial doubt as to competency arose with the trial court itself, the order for a psychiatric report was initiated by the trial court based on its own doubt, the report concluded that defendant was competent to stand trial, and the issue of competency was not raised by either party prior to final judgment. State v. O'Connell, 149 Vt. 114, 540 A.2d 1030 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        District court did not err in not holding a hearing to determine competency of defendant to stand trial and, by implication, to change his plea, where the defendant had been examined by a psychiatrist prior to the omnibus hearing at which he changed his pleas and the psychiatrist determined that he was competent to stand trial, the district judge was aware of the results of that examination when he accepted the guilty plea and also had the opportunity during the questioning mandated by V.R.Cr.P. 11, governing pleas, to observe the demeanor of the defendant and to determine that the guilty plea was made voluntarily and intelligently, and the defendant did not raise the issue of competency prior to final judgment as contemplated by this section. In re Cameron, 142 Vt. 193, 453 A.2d 405 (1982).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court has a duty to order a psychiatric examination and conduct a competency hearing if there is reason to believe that defendant may be incompetent to stand trial; once a defendant has been found competent, trial court must be alert to changed circumstances that would indicate need for a new determination of competency. State v. Lockwood, 160 Vt. 547, 632 A.2d 655 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where trial court had no indication of any change warranting new competency hearing for mildly retarded adult defendant, court did not err in relying on prior finding of competency rather than conducting new hearing prior to commencing probation revocation proceeding. State v. Lockwood, 160 Vt. 547, 632 A.2d 655 (1993).

         5. Finding of competency.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to support the court's finding that, despite defendant's bizarre behavior, he was competent to stand trial because of the testimony of physicians that he had a rational, rather than merely a factual, understanding of the proceedings against him and, more important, the mental health evidence suggested how to reconcile his apparent bizarre behavior with a conclusion that he was competent. State v. Bean, 171 Vt. 290, 762 A.2d 1259 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Existence of two incident reports suggesting that defendant might attempt disruptive actions at sentencing did not give court reason to believe that defendant was not competent to stand trial within meaning of 13 V.S.A.
        §
        4817(b) where defendant's allegedly suicidal conduct was fairly and thoroughly considered by court, which found it unconvincing, and psychiatrist evaluated defendant finding him competent to stand trial. State v. Ploof, 162 Vt. 560, 649 A.2d 774 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's ruling that defendant was not competent to represent himself did not necessarily imply that defendant was not competent to stand trial where court found that defendant was angry and uncooperative at hearing, that he had history of anger, and that he was charged with serious crime but court limited its ruling to defendant's capacity to represent himself in murder trial. State v. Ploof, 162 Vt. 560, 649 A.2d 774 (1994).

       </h5>
       <p>
        In evaluating defendant's argument that, despite the mental health evaluations that found him competent, his conduct was so bizarre that it showed him to be incompetent, it was the trial court's responsibility, in the first instance, to evaluate the evidence and to determine whether defendant's competency met the constitutional standard. State v. Bean, 171 Vt. 290, 762 A.2d 1259 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly concluded that defendant was competent to stand trial where, during court's colloquy in competency hearing, court observed defendant conferring with his attorney and defendant took notes and his demeanor during three-day hearing was appropriate. State v. Thompson, 162 Vt. 532, 650 A.2d 139 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly concluded that defendant was competent to stand trial where court found that defendant could adequately consult with others, knew names and functions of those involved in his case, reasonably understood rules, and was aware of specific charges, potential penalties, and potential consequences of proceedings. State v. Thompson, 162 Vt. 532, 650 A.2d 139 (1994).

       </p>
       <p>
        In light of the psychiatrist's continued finding of competence and defense counsel's failure to offer any contradictory evidence, the trial court reasonably denied the motion for another psychological evaluation; although defendant requested the psychological testing, 13 V.S.A.
        §
        4817(b) requires only that psychiatric testing be provided in certain circumstances, and in this case the court was not obligated to order further evaluation. State v. Ives, 162 Vt. 131, 648 A.2d 129 (1994).

       <p>
        Defendant's appeal from decisions finding him incompetent to stand trial and requiring hospitalization for psychiatric examination before a final competency hearing was moot, as he was no longer in custody and the charges had been dismissed. The stigma of temporary commitment did not overcome the mootness bar, and the "capable of repetition" exception to mootness did not apply because there was no prior history of the State of Vermont's involvement with defendant's mental health.

       <p>
        At a hearing to determine whether a defendant who relies on insanity as a defense is in need of treatment and should be hospitalized, the court is not authorized to decide whether the defendant was insane at the time of the alleged offense; that is an issue for the jury to decide at the trial on the merits. State v. Clarke, 145 Vt. 547, 496 A.2d 164 (1985).

        The sole issue at a hearing to determine whether a defendant who relies on insanity as a defense is in need of treatment and should be hospitalized is whether the defendant should be hospitalized because of his mental state at the time of that hearing.

         2. Jurisdiction.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        It is clear that the legislature intended mental health and retardation commitment proceedings "filed pursuant to" Title 18 to be initiated and disposed of in the family court, and it is no less clear that the legislature intended the question of custodial care and treatment for persons deemed incompetent to stand criminal trial to be heard in the same court that determined the person incompetent. There is no conflict between the provisions since family court jurisdiction expressly lies for cases filed pursuant to Title 18, while commitment cases arising under Title 13 are not filed at all, but proceed automatically from the criminal court's finding of defendant incompetence in the course of an underlying criminal prosecution; as the statutes are neither ambiguous nor incompatible in their alignment, no further interpretation is required. In re M.A., 189 Vt. 354, 22 A.3d 410 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        In committing defendant to the custody of the Commissioner of Disability, Aging, and Independent Living after finding that he was incompetent to stand trial, the district court properly exercised jurisdiction over defendant's commitment proceeding as originating out of the underlying criminal prosecution in that court. In re M.A., 189 Vt. 354, 22 A.3d 410 (2011).

        Defendant's claims on appeal from an order of the district court involuntarily hospitalizing him for ninety days pursuant to this section were not moot due to a subsequent commitment order issued after the expiration of the original commitment order pursuant to 18 V.S.A.
        §
        7620, because the negative collateral consequences of being initially adjudicated mentally ill and then involuntarily hospitalized could continue to plague defendant with both legal disabilities and social stigmatization. State v. J.S., 174 Vt. 619, 817 A.2d 53 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        In ordering involuntary hospitalization of defendant pursuant to this section, the district court was not required to make findings as to the availability of treatment alternatives as required by 18 V.S.A.
        §
        7617(c). State v. J.S., 174 Vt. 619, 817 A.2d 53 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        The standard for hospitalization under this section is the same as that for civil commitments under section 7101 of Title 18 - that the person is "in need of treatment," defined as one who is mentally ill and as a result of that illness is a danger to himself or to others. State v. Spear, 142 Vt. 547, 458 A.2d 1098 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, which permits commitment for an indeterminate period, but also provides that the commitment order shall have the same force and effect as an order issued under 18 V.S.A.
        §
        7619 which provides that an initial order of commitment be for a period of 90 days, the civil commitment 90-day limitation period applies to a criminal commitment for an indeterminate period and limits such commitment to 90 days. State v. Mayer, 139 Vt. 176, 423 A.2d 492 (1980).

         2. Effect of discharge.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Since mental health commitments are often for limited periods of time and are apt to recur, and, therefore, a person could be hospitalized repeatedly and then discharged, with each instance evading review, and even after discharge the collateral consequences of being found mentally ill could continue to plague a defendant, appeal of a commitment order is not moot because defendant has been discharged from custody. State v. Condrick, 144 Vt. 362, 477 A.2d 632 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme court had jurisdiction to hear appeal from order that defendant, charged with crimes but found insane, be committed for an indeterminate period and that a hearing be held before he could be released, even though defendant had been released, since the order was still in effect. State v. Mayer, 139 Vt. 176, 423 A.2d 492 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since involuntary commitments are usually of such short duration that they are situations aptly termed "capable of repetition, yet evading review," issue of validity of commitment was not made moot by final discharge from hospital. State v. O'Connell, 136 Vt. 43, 383 A.2d 624 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Validity of involuntary commitment was not made moot by his final discharge from hospital, for he continued to suffer the collateral consequences of his commitment, the legal disabilities radiating from the label of mentally incompetent being myriad and not dispelled by discharge; and that person had once before been hospitalized did not necessarily vitiate the collateral consequences of the contested commitment. State v. O'Connell, 136 Vt. 43, 383 A.2d 624 (1978).

         3. Findings.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In an involuntary commitment proceeding in a criminal case, although a psychiatrist was never asked whether defendant was dangerous to himself or others or whether the dangerousness was a result of defendant's mental illness, there was substantial evidence to support the trial court's finding that he was in need of treatment. The psychiatrist's reports concluded that defendant's delusional beliefs focused on a wide range of persons who were conspiring against him to violate his legal rights; his first report directly tied defendant's violent behavior to his mental illness and was a sufficient basis for the trial court to find the causal connection between defendant's mental illness and the alleged offenses. State v. Zorn, 195 Vt. 381, 88 A.3d 1164 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Based on the evidence and from its factual findings, the trial court properly inferred a connection between defendant's mental illness and his erratic driving, and the court was correct in concluding that causing a danger of harm to others as a motorist as a result of mental illness properly brought defendant within the statutory definition of a "person in need of treatment." State v. J.S., 174 Vt. 619, 817 A.2d 53 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Commitment order under this section cannot be justified in the absence of proof and sufficient findings that mental illness caused defendant to be a danger to others or to himself. State v. Robinson, 146 Vt. 486, 505 A.2d 674 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Commitment order under this section could not be justified, even if there was sufficient proof that defendant posed a danger to himself, where the court made no finding on this issue. State v. Robinson, 146 Vt. 486, 505 A.2d 674 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Record failed to support a finding that defendant posed a danger of harm to others, so as to justify a commitment order under this section, where there was no evidence that defendant inflicted or attempted to inflict bodily harm on another, that by his action or inaction he presented a danger to persons in his care, or that by his threats and actions he placed others in reasonable fear of physical harm to themselves. State v. Robinson, 146 Vt. 486, 505 A.2d 674 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is the duty of the court in commitment proceedings to state facts, not conclusions; mere recitations of diagnostic labels combined with pertinent statutory language will not suffice. State v. Condrick, 144 Vt. 362, 477 A.2d 632 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where this section required court to find a person presently mentally ill before court could order him involuntarily committed, and court did not make the finding, apparently relying instead on a psychiatrist's finding that person was mentally ill at time he allegedly committed crime which led to psychiatric examination upon plea of not guilty by reason of insanity, commitment would be vacated. State v. O'Connell, 136 Vt. 43, 383 A.2d 624 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, to commit person charged with a crime, court had to find he was mentally ill and would present a substantial risk of injury to himself or others if allowed to remain at liberty, or lacked sufficient capacity or insight to make a responsible decision as to his mental condition and was in need of custody, care and treatment, and court merely repeated expert's testimony, court's findings were inadequate. State v. O'Connell, 136 Vt. 43, 383 A.2d 624 (1978).

         4. Determination of insanity.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The finding by a court, after a hearing to determine whether a defendant who relies on insanity as a defense is in need of treatment and should be hospitalized, that the defendant is a person in need of treatment, is not relevant to whether the defendant was insane at the time of the alleged offense; therefore, such an order of commitment cannot serve as the basis for dismissal of a criminal charge. State v. Clarke, 145 Vt. 547, 496 A.2d 164 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Finding by court at hospitalization hearing that defendant was insane at the time of the alleged offense was a nullity, since the issue was not before the court, and the court had no authority to make a finding on that issue. State v. Clarke, 145 Vt. 547, 496 A.2d 164 (1985).

     The primary purpose of this act is to implement article IV, section 2, clause 2 of the United States Constitution, which gives a state through its governor the right to seek and obtain custody of a fugitive found in another state. Lovejoy v. State, 148 Vt. 239, 531 A.2d 921 (1987).

        In extraditions, although a warrant from demanding state's governor is prima facie evidence that constitutional and statutory requirements are met, and computations of the petitioner's sentence are demanding state's responsibility, asylum state must examine warrant's supporting documents to see whether they support or rebut prima facie case.

         11. Proof of fugitive status.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Under Vermont's law, fugitive status does not turn on the reason for a party's departure from the convicting jurisdiction, as a party's presence in another state is enough. Perron v. Menard, 205 Vt. 20, 171 A.3d 399 (June 9, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        As petitioner was sentenced to two-to-four years' imprisonment after conviction for grand larceny in a New York court and he had not completed his sentence, he remained charged with the original New York crime for purposes of extradition. Perron v. Menard, 205 Vt. 20, 171 A.3d 399 (June 9, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner was subject to extradition, as he was charged with commission of a crime in New York, he was a fugitive from justice, and regardless of the reason for his departure from New York it was undisputed that he was not currently in that jurisdiction. Perron v. Menard, 205 Vt. 20, 171 A.3d 399 (June 9, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, so long as fugitive was present in the demanding state at the time of the commission of the alleged crime, the date of his subsequent flight from the state is immaterial. In re Hval, 149 Vt. 58, 539 A.2d 537 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where copy of Rhode Island judgment and disposition which was complete on its face constituted adequate proof that petitioner was in Rhode Island at the time of the commission of the alleged crime, and that document, read together with requisition warrant itself and affidavit of petitioner's probation officer, answered claim that petitioner was not a fugitive from Rhode Island, petitioner was properly sought for extradition. In re Hval, 149 Vt. 58, 539 A.2d 537 (1987).

        In Vermont, there is no statutory requirement that a demanding state's rendition request include proof of identity. In re Haynes, 155 Vt. 256, 583 A.2d 88 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Rendition request which named defendant and included identifying documents such as fingerprints, photographs and written description of height, weight, eye and hair color, and scars adequately identified defendant as person to be extradited. In re Haynes, 155 Vt. 256, 583 A.2d 88 (1990).

       <p>
        Petitioner's argument that demand for extradition was inadequate because there was nothing to show that the informations were filed by the prosecutor as required by subdiv. (b)(3) of this section was rejected; the action of the foreign court in issuing an arrest warrant was sufficient to establish that the information had been filed by a prosecuting officer.

        In probation violation cases the crime for which extradition is sought is the underlying crime and not the probation violation; thus a showing that petitioner violated his probation is not required. In re Moskaluk, 156 Vt. 294, 591 A.2d 95 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in denying writ of habeas corpus where state demanding extradition provided no documents showing that petitioner's probation was still in effect at time of conduct which gave rise to extradition request, a requirement of extradition statute.

        Petitioner was entitled to habeas corpus relief from an extradition order as the documentation in the governor's warrant was vague and inconclusive. There were inconsistencies present in the only document containing sentencing information; there was a lack of evidence that the sentence imposed by the return had not expired by the time of petitioner's arrest; and in the absence of any confirmation that petitioner was on parole or probation, the court could not confirm petitioner's violation of either.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Proper arrest under properly executed governor's warrant pursuant to extradition proceedings would not have exclusionary rule applied to it to make it illegal on ground that initial arrest, under which person was being held when rearrested under the governor's warrant, was illegal as not having been made with probable cause. In re Saunders, 138 Vt. 259, 415 A.2d 199 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        That person was originally arrested as a fugitive from justice from another state, that his arrest was subsequently determined to have been made without probable cause, and that he was ordered released, did not vitiate his rearrest under properly executed governor's warrant issued pursuant to extradition proceedings. In re Saunders, 138 Vt. 259, 415 A.2d 199 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Extradition proceedings are generally intended to be summary and executive in nature and are to be distinguished from actual trials for crimes; thus, where it appears that an extradition warrant is otherwise valid, sound legal cause will exist for detention notwithstanding that there may have been a prior illegal arrest.

      If upon examination it appears that the person held is the person charged with having committed the crime alleged and that the person probably committed the crime, and, except in cases arising under section 4946 of this title, that the person has fled from justice, the judge or magistrate shall commit the person to jail by a warrant, reciting the accusation, for such a time, not exceeding 30 days, to be specified in the warrant as will enable the arrest of the accused to be made under a warrant of the Governor on a requisition of the executive authority of the state having jurisdiction of the offense, unless the accused give bail as provided in section 4956 of this title, or until the person shall be legally discharged.
    On request of the state, the hearing may be continued for up to three working days, only for the purpose of determining whether the person probably committed the crime.
    Findings under this section may be based upon hearsay evidence or upon copies of affidavits, whether certified or not, made outside this State.
    It shall be sufficient for a finding that a person probably committed the crime that there is a current grand jury indictment from another state.

        Article IV, section 2 of the United States Constitution required honoring of extradition warrant, despite petitioner's claim that he was detained more than 90 days in violation of this section and section 4957 of this title, since any irregularities in prerequisition detention were no bar to extradition once a rendition warrant was issued and received.

       <p>
        Issuance of governor's warrant directing the rendition of the plaintiff to sister state where he was sought as a fugitive from justice, and the detention of the plaintiff by virtue of his arrest under such warrant, was not made defective by a possible illegality in his previous detention beyond the statutory time under his arrest on a fugitive from justice warrant.

     <p>
      The term "fresh pursuit" as used in this subchapter shall include fresh pursuit as defined by the common law, and also the pursuit of a person who has committed a felony or who is reasonably suspected of having committed a felony or who is reasonably suspected of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol.
    It shall also include the pursuit of a person suspected of having committed a supposed felony, though no felony has actually been committed, if there is reasonable ground for believing that a felony has been committed.
    Fresh pursuit as used herein shall not necessarily imply instant pursuit, but pursuit without unreasonable delay.

         1. Nature and purpose of inquest.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Vermont's inquest procedure is not designed to be penal or accusatory; instead its sole function is one of investigation, and although investigatory, inquests are viewed as the exercise of judicial power. In re D.L., 164 Vt. 223, 669 A.2d 1172 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a separation of powers inquiry, an important factor for consideration is whether the court's participation in another branch's affairs is merely advisory, and the current inquest procedure does not offend the separation of powers because the court's role is advisory, enabling the prosecutor to make an informed charging decision. In re D.L., 164 Vt. 223, 669 A.2d 1172 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining the constitutionality of the inquest statute, the plain, ordinary meaning of the word "may" indicates that the statute is permissive and not mandatory; thus the district and superior courts are under no obligation to conduct an inquest when requested. In re D.L., 164 Vt. 223, 669 A.2d 1172 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        An inquest is essentially a criminal proceeding within the scope of constitutional guarantees. State v. Alexander, 130 Vt. 54, 286 A.2d 262 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although inquest statutes are not penal and the proceeding is not accusative, the investigation relates to criminal matters to determine the existence of probable cause and the statutes are thus to be strictly construed and will not be regarded as including anything not clearly and intelligibly described in the words thereof and manifestly intended by the legislature. State v. Alexander, 130 Vt. 54, 286 A.2d 262 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        An inquest is not analogous to a grand jury proceeding, for the former is only an investigatory proceeding to aid the state's attorney in deciding whether to prosecute and is at most a discovery procedure, while the latter determines the question of probable cause. State v. Alexander, 130 Vt. 54, 286 A.2d 262 (1971).

        An inquest is investigatory in nature, and is not prohibited by either statutory or case law where trial has commenced, so long as defendant is not prejudiced. State v. Bleau, 132 Vt. 101, 315 A.2d 448 (1974).

        Statutory authority under which inquests are conducted is to be strictly construed and will not be regarded as including use for any purpose not clearly and intelligibly described in the statutory language so as to be manifestly within the legislative intent, and that limitation as appropriately applies to the purposes for which disclosure is sought as it does to the original basis for convening an inquest. In re Certain Inquest Minutes, 137 Vt. 595, 409 A.2d 593 (1979).
       </p>

        Lower court ruling denying application for permission to disclose part of inquests minutes to certain persons without an evidentiary hearing and as a matter of discretion was soundly grounded and supportable at law. In re Certain Inquest Minutes, 137 Vt. 595, 409 A.2d 593 (1979).

        While the court's role in an inquest includes exercising its subpoena power, administering oaths, protecting the rights of witnesses, it does not include initiating the inquest investigation, formulating or presenting questions to witnesses, or deciding upon sufficiency of evidence; thus the court's role is limited to functioning as a neutral arbiter.

     <p>
      Before entering upon his or her duties, such stenographer shall be sworn to keep secret all matters and things coming before the judge at such inquest.
    Such oath shall be in writing, and the stenographer shall not disclose testimony so taken by him or her except to the Attorney General, State's Attorney, and the judge holding the inquest.
    The minutes of testimony so taken shall be the property of the State and the same or copy thereof shall not go out of the possession of such Attorney General, State's Attorney, or their successors except to an attorney appointed by the Supreme Court or Superior Court to act in the place of or assist a State's Attorney.
    However, nothing in this section shall prevent the stenographer from disclosing such evidence on an order of the Supreme or Superior Court, or a prosecuting attorney from disclosing such evidence to a defendant in such manner as the Supreme Court may by rule provide.

       <p>
        Certified questions relating to presence of sheriff at inquest, his participation in proceeding, his being provided with a transcript of the proceeding, and fact state's attorney who applied for inquest told respondent before he testified that he would not give attorney general respondent's testimony and attorney general obtained transcript of the testimony following resignation of state's attorney, raised no constitutional issue.

        Clerk of court and deputy sheriff should not have been allowed to be present at inquest, and secrecy provisions implicit in inquest statute were clearly violated. State v. Ploof, 133 Vt. 304, 336 A.2d 181 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant could not effectively avoid perjury prosecution simply because his testimony at inquest at which he was alleged to have committed perjury was heard by persons who should not have been present. State v. Ploof, 133 Vt. 304, 336 A.2d 181 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        This subchapter does not expressly provide that an inquest is strictly a secret investigatory proceeding; the intention of the legislative concerning secrecy of the product of the inquest is laid in this section, and the language is plain and clear that secrecy is mandated.

        Inquest which respondent attended at his own request and at which he testified to matter under investigation, though violative of letter and spirit of this section's secrecy provisions by reason of presence and participation of sheriff and the giving of a transcript of the testimony to sheriff, did not, on the record, prejudice respondent, and what occurred could not influence a verdict in the trial.

    Such order shall be made only on the petition of the State's Attorney for the county in which the crime is supposed to have been committed, setting forth the facts because of which the order is applied for, and verified by affidavit, and shall name the expert or experts by whom the examination is to be made, and limit the expense of the examination.
    Such expense shall be paid in the manner provided for the payment of witness fees in State causes in the Superior Court.

         2. Denial of counsel.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The Supreme Court's interpretation of the Public Defender Act, announced in State v. DeRosa, 161 Vt. 78, 633 A.2d 277 (1993), which held that when a trial judge denies counsel to an indigent defendant because a sentence of imprisonment will not be imposed, the trial judge may not impose on the defendant a conditionally suspended sentence and probation, applies to earlier convictions (i.e., convictions which were final before DeRosa was decided) that may be used for enhancement purposes under a recidivist statute such as 23 V.S.A.
        §
        1210(d). State v. Brown, 165 Vt. 79, 676 A.2d 350 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        A prior conviction for which an indigent defendant was denied counsel and sentenced to a suspended sentence may not be used for enhancement purposes, whether or not the defendant was actually imprisoned for the offense. State v. Brown, 165 Vt. 79, 676 A.2d 350 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a sentencing enhancement hearing, a defendant need not produce court records that affirmatively prove that counsel was denied in prior criminal prosecutions leading to convictions in violation of State v. DeRosa, 161 Vt. 78, 633 A.2d 277 (1993) (which held that when a trial judge denies counsel to an indigent defendant because a sentence of imprisonment will not be imposed, the trial judge may not impose on the defendant a conditionally suspended sentence and probation), if no such records exist.
    To challenge the use of a prior conviction for sentence enhancement purposes based on DeRosa, however, a defendant must affirmatively show that counsel was denied improperly, and may not simply rely on a record indicating that counsel was denied and a suspended sentence imposed. State v. Brown, 165 Vt. 79, 676 A.2d 350 (1996).

        Assignment of counsel and provision of services are treated separately, so that waiver or denial of one does not preclude entitlement to the other. Accordingly, nothing in the court's finding that petitioner had met his burden for obtaining expert services was inconsistent with its decision granting a motion for withdrawal of counsel.

         2. Constitutional law.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        There is no constitutional requirement to provide post-conviction relief petitioners with either counsel or services; the right to such services is entirely statutory. In re Barrows, 181 Vt. 283, 917 A.2d 490.
       </p>
       <p>
        Any state's program relative to constitutional right of access of indigent criminal defendants to the courts must be viewed as a whole in order to ascertain its compliance with constitutional standards, and while economic factors may be considered, the cost of protecting a constitutional right cannot justify its total denial. Hohman v. Hogan, 458 F. Supp. 669 (D. Vt. 1978).

         3. Selection of counsel.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Selection of assigned counsel to defend indigent rested in the trial court, not the indigent, and conviction would not be disturbed on the basis that indigent was not allowed to choose his own assigned counsel. State v. Bruley, 131 Vt. 366, 306 A.2d 672 (1973).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where the court cannot supply a transcript to the indigent defendant, his conviction does not require reversal; the statutory right to a transcript does not apply when the transcript and records are destroyed or lost, as they were in the instant case; it only applies where the state refuses to supply a transcript that has in its possession. State v. Lemire, 161 Vt. 624, 640 A.2d 541 (mem.) (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since a transcript is to be furnished at state expense to an indigent, and if required for appellate purposes, must be furnished as a matter of right under the United States Constitution, the judicial branch is compelled to request, and the legislative branch to provide, as a matter of constitutional duty, the reportorial staff necessary to carry out this mandate. State v. Kozikowski, 135 Vt. 93, 369 A.2d 1369 (1977).

       <p>
        The state must provide imprisoned indigent criminal defendants either adequate library facilities or legal assistance, but need not provide both. Hohman v. Hogan, 458 F. Supp. 669 (D. Vt. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        State's duty to provide indigent prisoner either adequate law libraries or adequate assistance from persons trained in the law, to protect constitutional right of access to the courts, does not impose a duty to provide a prisoner convicted under state law and incarcerated out of state with a library containing Vermont legal materials in the eventuality that prisoner chooses not to accept available adequate services of state public defender program. Hohman v. Hogan, 458 F. Supp. 669 (D. Vt. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Indigent prisoner convicted under Vermont law and incarcerated in federal prison in Illinois was not deprived of constitutional right to access to the courts by reason of fact prison library did not include Vermont legal materials, where Vermont made available every opportunity to rely on dedicated counsel from the defender general program of Vermont, who skillfully presented prisoner's claims, and where there was no impairment of the right to counsel and concurrent right to access to the courts. Hohman v. Hogan, 458 F. Supp. 669 (D. Vt. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Library program, available to prisoner convicted under Vermont law and incarcerated out-of-state in federal system, would satisfy requirements of United States Supreme Court decision providing that incarcerated indigents' right of access to the courts requires state to provide either adequate library facilities or adequate assistance from persons trained in the law, where, although the prison had no Vermont legal materials, prisoners had two sources to which they could apply for free photocopies of Vermont legal materials, one source normally taking a week for receipt of photos and the other source usually resulting in requests being filled within 48 hours. Hohman v. Hogan, 458 F. Supp. 669 (D. Vt. 1978).

       <p>
        When a needy person is entitled under Vermont law to the appointment of an attorney the appointment must be made, and failure to appoint counsel to assist prisoner claiming he was needy and making motion to vacate judgment of conviction of murder and praying for appointment of counsel to assist him and that he be granted a hearing on the motion, before denying the motion, was error of such prejudice that the ruling denying the motion on ground the files and records conclusively showed prisoner was entitled to no relief must be reversed and the matter remanded for appointment of counsel.

        The taking of nontestimonial evidence, such as blood samples or dental impressions, are not critical stages requiring notice to a defendant's counsel or triggering the right to counsel. State v. Marallo, 175 Vt. 469, 817 A.2d 1271 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since defendant had no right to counsel with respect to the execution of a nontestimonial identification order (NTO), and in any event, suffered no prejudice because of the absence of counsel, there were no grounds to suppress evidence gained through the NTO. State v. Marallo, 175 Vt. 469, 817 A.2d 1271 (mem.) (2002).

       <p>
        Trial court improperly denied inmate's motion to appoint counsel to represent her in habeas corpus proceeding; if determined to be needy, plaintiff was entitled to appointed attorney in habeas corpus as well as other proceedings, and if public defender's office could not represent plaintiff due to caseload, court was required to appoint attorney to represent her. Fletcher v. Gorczyk, 159 Vt. 631, 624 A.2d 1132 (mem.) (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Indigent criminal defendants' right to assistance of counsel at public expense is limited to offenses for which the defendant receives a sentence of imprisonment upon conviction or a fine in excess of $1,000. State v. Duval, 156 Vt. 122, 589 A.2d 321 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        An indigent defendant, convicted of a serious crime, is entitled to appointment of counsel to assist him in preparing a motion for reconsideration of sentence. State v. Rice, 148 Vt. 313, 532 A.2d 574 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant's pro se motion for reconsideration of his sentence for sexual assault included requests that the court appoint counsel and that counsel be allowed to amend the motion, defendant was entitled at least to a determination whether he was a needy person at the time of the motion. State v. Rice, 148 Vt. 313, 532 A.2d 574 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        The pendency of criminal prosecution triggers the court's obligation to assign counsel under this section. State v. Spear, 142 Vt. 547, 458 A.2d 1098 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        A proceeding to determine whether an accused should be examined by a psychiatrist and, if so, whether he should be committed to the state hospital for such examination, is a stage of the proceedings at which a needy person is entitled to the appointment of counsel. State v. Spear, 142 Vt. 547, 458 A.2d 1098 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where at arraignment of needy defendant on charge of disorderly conduct the court ordered that defendant be committed to the state hospital for 60 days of psychiatric examination to determine whether he was competent to stand trial, whether he was insane at the time of the offense, and whether he had the mental state required for the offense, defendant was entitled to the appointment of counsel at the arraignment, and the failure of the trial court to appoint a public defender constituted reversible error. State v. Spear, 142 Vt. 547, 458 A.2d 1098 (1983).

        In a prosecution for sexual assault, where pro se defendant requested laboratory analysis of containers of petroleum jelly offered by the state to corroborate the victim's statement that defendant often used petroleum jelly to facilitate penetration, defendant claiming that he used the jelly on his paint brushes to keep the bristles soft and that analysis of the jelly would have revealed the presence of paint thinner which, according to defendant, would have caused burning and inflammation if applied to the skin, the court did not abuse its discretion in concluding that defendant demonstrated that an adequate defense could not be mounted without this evidence. Defendant demonstrated specifically the purpose and nature of the service he sought; if consistent with his claim, the laboratory analysis would have undermined the state's corroborating evidence. State v. Handson, 166 Vt. 85, 689 A.2d 1081 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        The cost of telephone calls made by a pro se defendant from a correctional facility should have been borne by the Department of Corrections, not the defender general. The charges (which included a $1.75 surcharge on every call) were far higher than those incurred by other state agencies, including the offices of the defender general and attorney general, and requiring the defender general to pay such charges may have violated the statutory mandate (13 V.S.A.
        §
        5277) that those representing indigent defendants be able "to use any state technical services and facilities . . . that are available to the prosecutor." Moreover, the telephones available to the staff at the correctional facility were not subject to the surcharge. State v. Handson, 166 Vt. 85, 689 A.2d 1081 (1996), (decided under facts existing prior to 1996 amendment).
       </p>
       <p>
        A defendant who qualifies as a needy person under Vermont's Public Defender Act has a distinct right to be provided with the necessary services and facilities of representation as authorized or later approved by the court, and exercise of that right cannot be conditioned on acceptance of the services of an attorney appointed under 13 V.S.A.
        §

        Given that indigent defendants who choose to represent themselves are entitled under the Public Defender Act, 13 V.S.A.
        §
        5231(2), "to public funding for . . . necessary expenses" related to their defense, the defender general, not the judiciary, is financially responsible for such expenses. The defender general ordinarily provides for the defense of indigent defendants, which would include the cost of representation and accompanying services, such as clerical support, investigative services, and laboratory tests. By waiving the right to a public defender, a defendant relieves the defender general of a substantial financial obligation. State v. Handson, 166 Vt. 85, 689 A.2d 1081 (1996), (decided under facts existing prior to 1996 amendment).

       </h5>
       <p>
        A needy defendant or prisoner has a statutory right to "necessary services and facilities of representation" at state expense, regardless of whether the person is pro se or represented by counsel, so long as the person shows that the services are necessary to his defense. In re Barrows, 181 Vt. 283, 917 A.2d 490.
       </p>
       <p>
        Showing the necessity for services and facilities of representation at state expense requires more than a bare assertion of need; it requires that the specific purpose and nature of the expert assistance be demonstrated and a further showing that an adequate case cannot be made absent such assistance. In the context of post-conviction relief, such assistance means showing how the assistance advances the argument that petitioner's trial was fundamentally flawed. In re Barrows, 181 Vt. 283, 917 A.2d 490.
       </p>
       <p>
        Post-conviction relief petitioner's motion expressing the need for a legal expert to aid in his claims of ineffective assistance of counsel was denied where the expert assistance requested did not comport to the allegations made. Petitioner never connected his alleged conspiracies and conflicts to any deficient performance by his attorney in the course of representation, conduct that would be appropriate for expert evaluation. In re Barrows, 181 Vt. 283, 917 A.2d 490.
       </p>
       <p>
        Post-conviction relief petitioner failed in his requests for DNA, chemical, and investigative services. Even though petitioner was somewhat more specific with these requests by identifying the factual claims for which these services would be of assistance, he still failed, however, to show necessity. In re Barrows, 181 Vt. 283, 917 A.2d 490.
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant's income was more than five times the poverty guideline for a two-person family unit and her expenses reflected a lifestyle that was not luxurious, but one that was substantially above the level at which state support should be compelled, without substantial change in her finances, defendant was not eligible for state payment of defense expenses.

        Vermont provides representation in the proceeding following a petition in juvenile court including any subsequent proceedings arising from an order therein, and the statutes on juvenile proceedings specifically provide that an order of the court may be set aside in accordance with Rule 60. In enacting the statutory scheme for juvenile proceedings, the Legislature specifically contemplated that a Rule 60 motion is a "subsequent proceeding" that may arise; therefore, parents who had voluntarily relinquished their parental rights were entitled to assigned counsel for purposes of their Rule 60(b) motion seeking to reopen the termination of parental rights decision.

        Error in denying parents assigned counsel for purposes of their Rule 60(b) motion seeking to reopen a termination of parental rights decision was not harmless based on the parents' failure to appear at the hearing due to car trouble, as an attorney might have been ready and able to proceed with the Rule 60(b) hearing even in the parents' temporary absence or could have advocated for a brief recess or continuance, and it could not be assumed that if they had had the advice of counsel the parents would have responded to their car troubles the same way.

        Assignment of counsel and provision of services are treated separately, so that waiver or denial of one does not preclude entitlement to the other. Accordingly, nothing in the court's finding that petitioner had met his burden for obtaining expert services was inconsistent with its decision granting a motion for withdrawal of counsel.

        As an inmate's post-conviction relief petition was filed after the amendment of the statute that provided for assignment of counsel, it applied to his proceeding. In re Bruyette, 196 Vt. 261, 96 A.3d 1151 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defender General properly denied publicly funded representation in an inmate's post-conviction relief appeal because it asserted that the representation would violate the ethical and civil procedure rules. In re Bruyette, 196 Vt. 261, 96 A.3d 1151 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        When petitioner filed his postconviction relief (PCR) petition in 2001, he had an unconditional right to representation under the then-existing version of the statute regarding the representation of postconviction relief petitioners. Under the statute regarding the effect of a statutory amendment, his right to representation under the former PCR statute remained vested after the statute was amended in 2004; thus, petitioner did not lose his right to appointed counsel when his attorney withdrew based on his determination that the PCR petition no longer raised nonfrivolous bases for relief. In re Crannell, 192 Vt. 406, 60 A.3d 632 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Pursuant to an administrative order, the court notifies the public defender in all cases where the right of a needy person to be represented by counsel exists, and is not waived, and the court appoints counsel if the public defender is unable, due to a conflict of interest or otherwise, to represent the person in question, among other circumstances. Taken literally, no assignment should occur until the needy person has established his or her statutory right to counsel; presumably, such assignment would follow the Public Defender's review process and a determination by counsel that the case is not frivolous under the statute governing counsel in postconviction relief proceedings. In re Bailey, 187 Vt. 176, 992 A.2d 276 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is clear from the plain language of the statute governing counsel in postconviction relief proceedings that counsel must decide when state-funded legal representation is warranted in a postconviction proceeding. This construct reasonably serves a petitioner's statutory interest in assistance of counsel in civil proceedings, while requiring no second-guessing by courts, nor imposing any obligation, or need, for an attorney to declare and expose the relative weaknesses in a petitioner's legal position. In re Bailey, 187 Vt. 176, 992 A.2d 276 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        When counsel avers to the court that the claims, defenses, and other legal contentions presented in a postconviction relief proceeding are not warranted by existing law or nonfrivolous argument, counsel may withdraw, and the State's obligation to the petitioner is fulfilled, under the statute governing counsel in postconviction relief proceedings. Counsel's representation to the court that he or she cannot ethically advocate her client's position, particularly when confirmed by the Public Defender's review, satisfies the statute; this approach implements the statute and avoids having the attorney "sandbag" the client's case. In re Bailey, 187 Vt. 176, 992 A.2d 276 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court presumes that an attorney acts diligently in assessing a postconviction relief petitioner's claims and that, as an officer of the court, he or she is not misrepresenting the situation. This is not to suggest that lawyers are infallible, but in the relatively few instances where the Public Defender withdraws, petitioners can continue with their litigation, albeit pro se, and may still prevail in the remedy sought if, in the court's view, the claim is ultimately established; moreover, if it appears to the trial court during pretrial proceedings that there may be substance and merit to a petition, the court may reappoint counsel to reevaluate the case accordingly. In re Bailey, 187 Vt. 176, 992 A.2d 276 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no constitutional or statutory right to insist that counsel elaborate on their motions to withdraw, and it would undermine the intent of the statute governing counsel in postconviction relief proceedings to require counsel to do so. The time and resources spent in documenting and litigating the frivolousness of the underlying claim would likely compromise whatever remained of the lawyer-client relationship, while forcing the appointed counsel to walk an ethical tightrope; the same time and effort would likely consume some or all of the scarce resources available to the Public Defender sought to be saved by that office in denying representation, and sought to be saved by the legislature in authorizing the Defender to deny service for lack of merit. In re Bailey, 187 Vt. 176, 992 A.2d 276 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appointed counsel in an appeal from a postconviction relief petition was not required to file an Anders-like affidavit before being allowed to withdraw. Her representation that she could not continue to represent petitioner under the ethical rules and in light of the statute governing counsel in postconviction relief proceedings was sufficient. In re Bailey, 187 Vt. 176, 992 A.2d 276 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court's assignment of counsel is based solely on whether a petitioner has demonstrated that he or she is a financially needy person. A needy person, by statute, has the right to be represented by an attorney in a postconviction relief proceeding only in cases that the attorney decides are nonfrivolous. In re Bailey, 187 Vt. 176, 992 A.2d 276 (2009).

         1. Reversible error.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The court erred in considering the income of defendant's father, with whom defendant lived, and as a result, denying defendant assignment of counsel on grounds that defendant was not a financially needy person; cohabitant income is relevant only in determining co-payment and reimbursement of assigned counsel. State v. Bailey, 165 Vt. 579, 682 A.2d 387 (mem.) (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where judicial proceedings had already been commenced, in form of informations charging defendant with serious crime, at time admissions by defendant to state police officer were made, and there had been no waiver of defendant's right to counsel at commencement of detention, mandate for notification of public defender applied, with later determination of need or its absence, and reimbursement if indicated, and failure to suppress admissions was reversible error. State v. Nicasio, 136 Vt. 162, 385 A.2d 1096 (1978), overruled on other grounds, State v. Savo (1981) 139 Vt. 644, 433 A.2d 292.

         2. Appointment of counsel.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Vermont Supreme Court does not read the words "upon commencement of detention" in the Public Defender Act to impose an obligation on law enforcement officers to contact a public defender at the exact moment a defendant is arrested or detained, or at the very instant that the right to counsel is invoked. State v. Robitaille, 191 Vt. 91, 38 A.3d 52 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        When defendant had been arrested and was awaiting transportation to a corrections facility, the failure to contact a public defender within 15 minutes did not warrant suppression as a violation of the Public Defender Act or the Vermont Constitution. During the 15 minutes that elapsed after defendant invoked his rights and before he waived them, he was not subjected to custodial interrogation. State v. Robitaille, 191 Vt. 91, 38 A.3d 52 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether there had been a violation of the Public Defender Act, the trial court did not require defendant to prove bad faith on the part of police, but simply observed that there was no evidence that an officer was engaging in gamesmanship by not contacting an attorney within 15 minutes. Given that, at its core, the Public Defender Act is designed to address Miranda's concern for bad faith interrogation of individuals accused of a crime without the presence of counsel, the absence of bad faith was not a wholly irrelevant consideration. State v. Robitaille, 191 Vt. 91, 38 A.3d 52 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the provision of this section requiring that, after a person has been detained or charged with a crime, "[u]pon commencement of any later judicial proceeding" the person shall be informed of the right to representation at public expense, the "later judicial proceeding" was not the telephone conversation through which a judge ordered defendant temporarily held without bail, but rather his formal arraignment at a later date. State v. Provost, 179 Vt. 337, 896 A.2d 55 (December 23, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court improperly denied inmate's motion to appoint counsel to represent her in habeas corpus proceeding; if determined to be needy, plaintiff was entitled to appointed attorney in habeas corpus as well as other proceedings, and if public defender's office could not represent plaintiff due to caseload, court was required to appoint attorney to represent her. Fletcher v. Gorczyk, 159 Vt. 631, 624 A.2d 1132 (mem.) (1992).

        Although it grants a right to counsel, 23 V.S.A.
        §
        1202 contains little detail about that right, and so when called upon to define the nature of the right, the courts have often looked to the public defender act, specifically 13 V.S.A.
        <span class="s1">
         §
        </span>
        5234 of that Act, reasoning that 23 V.S.A.
        <span class="s1">

        </span>
        1202 and 13 V.S.A.
        <span class="s1">
         §
        </span>
        5234 should be read in pari materia. State v. Fuller, 163 Vt. 523, 660 A.2d 302 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The person being processed under 23 V.S.A.
        §
        1202 must be informed of his right to consult with counsel before deciding whether to submit to a chemical test. State v. Fuller, 163 Vt. 523, 660 A.2d 302 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The rights contained in the public defender act are not directly applicable to the right in the implied consent law to consult counsel before deciding whether to take a blood-alcohol test; the public defender act implements the general right to counsel provided by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution as well as Article 10 of Chapter I of the Vermont Constitution while the right to consult with counsel contained in the implied consent law is purely statutory, created by 23 V.S.A.
        §
        1202(c), and is not constitutionally mandated because the decision whether to take the breath test is not a critical stage of the prosecution. State v. Fuller, 163 Vt. 523, 660 A.2d 302 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The public defender act applies only when the defendant is detained or charged and only with respect to conditions in which a person having his own counsel would be entitled to be so represented, whereas the implied consent statute applies whenever a person is asked to take a blood-alcohol test irrespective of whether the person is detained at the time. State v. Fuller, 163 Vt. 523, 660 A.2d 302 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 5237 of chapter 13 states specifically that it relates only to persons informed of the right to counsel under 13 V.S.A.
        §
        5234 and the waiver of rights created in the public defender act, and thus by its terms the statute does not apply to rights created by the implied consent law and advice given under that law. State v. Fuller, 163 Vt. 523, 660 A.2d 302 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        A person asked to take a breath test must be informed that a needy person may consult with an attorney at public expense before making a decision. State v. Gracey, 140 Vt. 199, 436 A.2d 741 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Law enforcement officer's failure to inform driver who submitted to blood alcohol test of his right to consult counsel before deciding whether to submit mandated suppression of the results of the test. State v. Duff, 136 Vt. 537, 394 A.2d 1145 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section, requiring that a law enforcement officer clearly inform a person of his right to be represented by an attorney if he is being detained by the officer without charge or judicial process, read in pari materia with law providing that a person requested by a law enforcement officer to submit to a chemical test for blood alcohol content shall have the right to consult an attorney prior to deciding whether to submit to the test, requires that a person be informed of his right to consult counsel before deciding whether to submit to a blood alcohol test. State v. Duff, 136 Vt. 537, 394 A.2d 1145 (1978).

       <p>
        This section recognizes Miranda's concern for bad faith interrogation of individuals accused of a crime without the presence of counsel, reflects the state's policy of securing for those individuals an immediate right to counsel, and relieves law enforcement officers of the task of determining financial need, but safeguards the duty to furnish counsel to indigent individuals accused of serious crimes. State v. Picknell, 142 Vt. 215, 454 A.2d 711 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The policy of this section is one of requiring notice to a public defender absent other representation, with a later determination of financial need or its absence, and reimbursement if indicated. State v. Picknell, 142 Vt. 215, 454 A.2d 711 (1982).

         5. Waiver.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court's decision denying defendant's motion to suppress contained no consideration of factors indicating a knowing and intelligent waiver of Miranda rights and no consideration of factors indicating his awareness of his statutory rights and the consequences of waiving them as required by the waiver statute. Instead, as far as the court could tell from its order, the trial court reached its conclusion that defendant made a valid waiver of his rights by assuming that defendant possessed the requisite experience, education, background, and intelligence to understand the nature of his rights and the consequences of waiving them; thus, the trial court erred by failing to make the required inquiry. State v. Mumley, 186 Vt. 52, 978 A.2d 6 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant waived his right to counsel by signing a Miranda waiver prior to his interview with police on the morning after shootings, his refusal to continue talking to police later that morning was not a revocation of that waiver. A valid waiver of counsel was thus in effect throughout defendant's detention under both Miranda and the Vermont Public Defender Act, and there was no point at which officers were required to contact a public defender on defendant's behalf. State v. Provost, 179 Vt. 337, 896 A.2d 55 (December 23, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        A valid waiver of right to counsel under Miranda standards will also serve as valid waiver under provision of Vermont Public Defender Act. State v. Caron, 155 Vt. 492, 586 A.2d 1127 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant who was arrested on the basis of an outstanding bench warrant and transported to the police station, after being read his Miranda rights, stated that he would see what the questions were before deciding whether he would answer them, and specifically stated that he did not wish to have an attorney present at the time, although he was never asked to sign a formal waiver of his rights, the statements defendant made during the subsequent interrogation were admissible into evidence, even though he had not been advised of his right to an attorney under subsection (a) of this section at the precise moment of his arrest, since no custodial interrogation had taken place from the time he was arrested until the time he was issued his Miranda rights, and, once the defendant was advised of his rights, he knowingly, voluntarily and intelligently waived those rights. State v. Picknell, 142 Vt. 215, 454 A.2d 711 (1982).

        Vermont Public Defender Act requires that defendant waive his right to counsel either in writing or by other record; a waiver "by other record" must be one in which the record is created by an action of the defendant, and a waiver form upon which a police officer has noted that defendant made an oral waiver is not sufficient under the statute. State v. Caron, 155 Vt. 492, 586 A.2d 1127 (1990).

       <p>
        Trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress statements for violation of Vermont Public Defender Act's requirement that waiver be in writing or other record created by an act of defendant; the act did not apply to waiver preceding interrogation by extraterritorial police department.

        The right to counsel provision of the implied consent law and the waiver provision of the public defender act are not to be held in pari materia, and therefore the written waiver requirement of 13 V.S.A.
        §
        5237 is inapplicable to the waiver of the right to consult counsel prior to deciding whether to take a blood-alcohol test. State v. Fuller, 163 Vt. 523, 660 A.2d 302 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Section 5237 of chapter 13 states specifically that it relates only to persons informed of the right to counsel under 13 V.S.A.
        §
        5234 and the waiver of rights created in the public defender act, and thus by its terms the statute does not apply to rights created by the implied consent law and advice given under that law. State v. Fuller, 163 Vt. 523, 660 A.2d 302 (1995).

       <p>
        Elements necessary for a valid waiver of counsel are provided by 13 V.S.A.

       <p>
        There was no violation of Miranda or the Public Defender Act when defendant made an uncoerced choice to speak with the interrogating officer, recognizing that "he just knew somebody was going to holler at him later for it probably," his statement to the officer was not an unequivocal invocation of his right to counsel, and he demonstrated more than the requisite level of comprehension about the rights to which he was entitled and the consequences of waiving those rights. State v. Webster, 206 Vt. 178, 179 A.3d 149 (Oct. 20, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Admission of statement by defendant elicited in violation of right of counsel was harmless where it was clear beyond reasonable doubt that jury would have rendered guilty arson verdict absent offending evidence; statement was not a confession, but merely an attempt to implicate another person and it was inculpatory only to extent that it might have revealed inconsistencies in defendant's explanation of what happened on night of the fire. State v. Keith, 160 Vt. 257, 628 A.2d 1247 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Written waiver of right to counsel was not satisfied where after defendant explicitly refused to sign form designated as waiving right to counsel, he signed statement that made no mention of right to counsel but merely contained an acknowledgement that statement was made of his own free will. State v. Keith, 160 Vt. 257, 628 A.2d 1247 (1993).

       <p>
        Where defendant orally agreed to waive his Miranda rights and then made statements to police before later signing a written waiver, the trial court properly suppressed all statements made by defendant while in the police car after determining that the written waiver form was ineffective. State v. Jeffreys, 165 Vt. 579, 682 A.2d 951 (mem.) (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was an insufficient showing that defendant competently and intelligently waived counsel, with full awareness of the consequences of the waiver. State v. Pollard, 163 Vt. 199, 657 A.2d 185 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant may waive publicly provided counsel if the court, at the time of or after waiver, finds of record that defendant has acted with full awareness of his rights and of consequences of a waiver and if the waiver is otherwise according to law. State v. Pollard, 163 Vt. 199, 657 A.2d 185 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although district court's colloquy with defendant concerning his desire to waive counsel indicated that the court touched on some of the dangers of self-representation, such as the defendant's inability to later claim ineffective assistance of counsel, it also demonstrated that the court did not engage in the full-scale inquiry into defendant's experience, motives, and understanding of his undertaking as required by State v. Merrill, 155 Vt. 422, 425, 584 A.2d 1129, 1131 (1990). State v. Pollard, 163 Vt. 199, 657 A.2d 185 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even though the federal constitution does not require a written waiver, the State legislature, through 13 V.S.A.
        §
        5237, requires that a waiver of the right to counsel under Miranda must be in writing created by the defendant's own actions; any evidence obtained in violation of 13 V.S.A.
        <span class="s1">
         §
        </span>
        5237 must be suppressed. State v. Fuller, 163 Vt. 523, 660 A.2d 302 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Once a construction of 13 V.S.A.
        §
        5237 is at issue, the requirement of a written waiver is clear; if a waiver was required and not given in the manner prescribed by statute, evidence obtained in the subsequent questioning of defendant must be suppressed. State v. Pellerin, 161 Vt. 229, 637 A.2d 1078 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's conviction of sexual assault on a minor was reversed and remanded since waiver was not in writing, although defendant, while in police custody, was read the
        Miranda
        rights, indicated he understood his rights, had no questions, and agreed to talk with officers without an attorney present. State v. Pellerin, 161 Vt. 229, 637 A.2d 1078 (1993).

        In assessing the validity of a waiver of counsel, the better practice is for the trial court to inquire on the record into the defendant's experience, motives, and understanding of what he is undertaking, and to explain the available options to protect defendant's rights to counsel, the full nature of the charges against him, the range of allowable punishment, and the consequences of proceeding without the aid of an attorney. The court should also provide a clear explanation of the adverse consequences of pro se representation so that a reviewing court may determine that the defendant knowingly accepted the risk. State v. Tribble, 179 Vt. 235, 892 A.2d 232 (December 30, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        In reviewing whether defendant made a valid waiver of counsel, the totality of the circumstances is considered. State v. Tribble, 179 Vt. 235, 892 A.2d 232 (December 30, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        In regard to defendant's waiver of counsel, specific circumstances, such as a defendant's past experience in representing himself, or pretrial attempts to obtain or to fire counsel, or even his conduct at trial, may reveal that in-depth inquiry or extensive advice is not necessary in that particular case. But it is also clear that a court may not conclude from silence or other equivocal conduct that a defendant has waived his right to counsel. State v. Tribble, 179 Vt. 235, 892 A.2d 232 (December 30, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to assess the validity of a waiver of counsel, the trial court must determine whether the defendant made the waiver knowingly and voluntarily. In general, the trial court must conduct an inquiry into the nature of the defendant's understanding of the rights he is waiving. State v. Tribble, 179 Vt. 235, 892 A.2d 232 (December 30, 2005).

         8. Inquiry.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court's decision denying defendant's motion to suppress contained no consideration of factors indicating a knowing and intelligent waiver of Miranda rights and no consideration of factors indicating his awareness of his statutory rights and the consequences of waiving them as required by the waiver statute. Instead, as far as the court could tell from its order, the trial court reached its conclusion that defendant made a valid waiver of his rights by assuming that defendant possessed the requisite experience, education, background, and intelligence to understand the nature of his rights and the consequences of waiving them; thus, the trial court erred by failing to make the required inquiry. State v. Mumley, 186 Vt. 52, 978 A.2d 6 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        In light of the questions surrounding defendant's competency and mental health, which persisted at the time of trial, and in spite of the considerable, and admirable, efforts the court made to accommodate defendant during the pendency of the case, the court did not have before it a record of unequivocal conduct indicating a waiver of counsel by defendant. Accordingly, the court was obliged to conduct an on-the-record inquiry before accepting defendant's waiver of counsel. State v. Tribble, 179 Vt. 235, 892 A.2d 232 (December 30, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because it could not be concluded that defendant knowingly accepted the risk of proceeding without counsel, particularly given his acknowledged mental health issues, which, as noted by experts, did relate in part to his ability to interact with his attorneys, it was necessary to reverse the trial court's decision that defendant validly waived his right to counsel, and, with it, defendant's conviction. State v. Tribble, 179 Vt. 235, 892 A.2d 232 (December 30, 2005).

       On or before June 1 of each year, the Defender General shall calculate an average direct cost per case of representation extended in the preceding calendar year by category of case. The categories of cases for which calculations are made shall be: felonies; misdemeanors; postconviction and miscellaneous criminal-related proceedings, including violations of probation, extraditions, and habeas corpus; juvenile proceedings, not including juvenile delinquency proceedings; and appeals. The calculations shall be based on all representation supported by the budget of the Defender General whether provided by public defenders, contractors or assigned counsel. The administrative costs of running the Office of Defender General shall not be included in the calculation.
      </li>
      <li id="t13p02c163sub02s5238ol1b">
       The court shall require any person assigned counsel pursuant to section 5236 of this title to pay for all or part of the cost of representation based upon his or her ability to pay. Unless the person and cohabiting family members are found to be financially unable to pay, in all cases the court shall order a minimum payment of $50.00. This assignment fee shall be paid within 60 days of assignment of counsel. If the court finds that the income of the person and cohabiting family members for the past year equaled or exceeded 125 percent of the federal poverty level applicable to their family size, the balance to be paid by the person found eligible, when added to the minimum assignment fee, shall be equal to the amount calculated according to the following chart:
      </li>
      <li id="t13p02c163sub02s5238ol1c">
       The amount to be paid under subsection (b) of this section shall be divided by the court between a co-payment and reimbursement amount. A separate payment amount shall be calculated for each proceeding. If a defendant is charged with more than one related offense, the court may impose one payment amount calculated based on the category of case for the offense with the highest possible punishment.
      </li>
      <li id="t13p02c163sub02s5238ol1d">
       To the extent that the court finds that the eligible person has income or assets available to enable payment of an immediate co-payment, it shall order such a co-payment to cover in whole or in part the amount of the costs of representation to be borne by the eligible person. The co-payment shall be paid to the clerk of the court. Any portion of the co-payment not paid to the clerk may be included in a reimbursement order.
      </li>
      <li id="t13p02c163sub02s5238ol1e">
       The remainder of the amount to be paid by the person found eligible shall be ordered to be paid in a reimbursement order. Unless the court extends the time because the eligible person is incarcerated or good cause is shown, the reimbursement amount shall become due 60 days from the date of the order.
      </li>
      <li id="t13p02c163sub02s5238ol1f">
       A person who may be or has been ordered to pay all or part of the cost of representation by co-payment or reimbursement order may at any time petition the court making the order for remission of all of the amount or any part thereof. If it appears to the satisfaction of the court that payment of the amount due will impose manifest hardships on the defendant or the defendant's immediate family or that the circumstances of case disposition and the interests of justice so require, the court may remit all or part of the amount due or modify the method of payment.
      </li>
      <li id="t13p02c163sub02s5238ol1g">
       A juvenile shall not be ordered to pay any part of the cost of representation.

       A copayment or reimbursement order under this section shall be made by the clerk of the court or any other judicial officer of the court.

        Although the Public Defender Act does not authorize courts to assign civil contempt proceedings to the Defender General even where the trial court considers ordering incarceration, nor does it authorize compensation of appointed counsel to be made from funds appropriated to the Office of the Defender General, the court has the inherent power to require attorneys to serve and protect the vital interests of uncounselled litigants where circumstances demand it. Public defenders, like all members of the bar, are subject to such appointment. Russell v. Armitage, 166 Vt. 392, 697 A.2d 630 (1997).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The cost of telephone calls made by a pro se defendant from a correctional facility should have been borne by the Department of Corrections, not the defender general. The charges (which included a $1.75 surcharge on every call) were far higher than those incurred by other state agencies, including the offices of the defender general and attorney general, and requiring the defender general to pay such charges may have violated the statutory mandate (13 V.S.A.
        §
        5277) that those representing indigent defendants be able "to use any state technical services and facilities . . . that are available to the prosecutor." Moreover, the telephones available to the staff at the correctional facility were not subject to the surcharge. State v. Handson, 166 Vt. 85, 689 A.2d 1081 (1996).

        Plaintiffs had not shown an Ex Post Facto Clause violation in that statutory and administrative changes subsequent to their incarceration did not remove or limit the discretion vested in the Parole Board and the Department of Corrections. The statute enumerating "listed crimes" for purposes of the victims' rights statute did not increase or even apply to the length of plaintiffs' incarceration, and thus did not facially violate the Ex Post Facto Clause; furthermore, there was no evidence that in 1992, inmates like plaintiffs who were convicted of serious violent offenses and were determined to pose a high risk of reoffending would have been released at their minimum even if they completed programming.

        Where the school board found that students who brought pellet guns to school took the guns from a locked box in plaintiff student's house, while plaintiff was present, the board was within its discretion in determining that plaintiff's behavior violated the school district's weapons policy's prohibition of actions that "cause, encourage, or aid any other student to possess, handle, or transmit" weapons at school.

        A family friend or fiance is not a "family member" under victim's-testimony statutes, and thus is not a "victim" in a homicide case. State v. Kimmick, 181 Vt. 635, 928 A.2d 489 (mem.) (May 24, 2007).

       <p>
        Defendant failed in his claim that it was plain error to permit a family friend and fiance of the victim's sister to testify at sentencing because, pursuant to V.R.Cr.P. 32(a)(1), the prosecution may "present any information relevant to sentencing," and, most significantly, defendant failed to object to allowing the friend to testify, and failed to object to any of the content of his testimony.

         5. Restitution.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        As defendant failed to argue at a restitution hearing that unlawful trespass could not be the predicate offense for an award of restitution, such issue was waived for purposes of appellate review; raising the issue in a post-judgment motion was not sufficient. State v. Tetrault, 192 Vt. 616, 54 A.3d 146 (2012), (mem.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Restitution was properly awarded for items that were used but not damaged, as the evidence established a link between the loss and the offense of unlawful trespassing, and there was evidence that the losses were a direct result of the crime. State v. Tetrault, 192 Vt. 616, 54 A.3d 146 (2012), (mem.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Amount of restitution awarded for items that were used or damaged by defendant and defendant's friends was proper where it was based on the replacement value rather than the actual value at the time of the unlawful trespass, as the property owner did not receive a windfall by receiving replacement value for items that did not have a "blue book" value. State v. Tetrault, 192 Vt. 616, 54 A.3d 146 (2012), (mem.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the statute, any restitution award must be limited to the material losses that the decedent incurred as a direct result of the defendant's crime; Vermont law requires there to be a direct link between the loss for which restitution is ordered and the conduct for which defendant has been convicted. Here, the only such loss included in the restitution orders, according to the State's description, was the decedent's $5,138 medical bill not covered by insurance. State v. Kenvin, 191 Vt. 30, 38 A.3d 26 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislature's use of the words "direct result" indicates that it intended to provide restitution only to direct victims of crime; the restitution statute has a narrow definition of "victim," and restitution may not include payments to insurers of direct victims. A medical provider is not a proper recipient of restitution because the provider's loss is consequential to, rather than a direct result of, the defendant's criminal conduct. State v. Thomas, 189 Vt. 106, 14 A.3d 961 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because a hospital that treated the victim was not a direct victim of defendant's crime, the Court struck the portion of the order granting it restitution. The proper remedy was to order that the amount of the hospital bill be paid to the victim of the assault. State v. Thomas, 189 Vt. 106, 14 A.3d 961 (2010).

       </h5>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for negligent operation of a motor vehicle where defendant was involved in a fatal collision, the sentencing court did not err in finding that the decedent was a victim for purposes of the victim statement statute, and because the decedent could not testify himself, it was appropriate for his mother to testify on his behalf. The sentencing court was within its discretion to consider the causes of the accident that killed the decedent and resulting impact on the decedent's family members. State v. Scott, 195 Vt. 330, 88 A.3d 1173 (2013).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Based on rules of statutory construction, the sealing of records of a conviction for a crime that was committed before an applicant turned 21 years of age was statutorily permitted as long as the applicant had not been convicted of a listed crime or adjudicated delinquent of a listed crime since the original conviction, even if the conviction sought to be sealed was for a listed crime.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The 1999 addition of the list of offenses that qualify as "listed crimes" for purposes of the victims' rights statute did not change the statutory punishment for any of the listed crimes; nor did the amendment alter the standards for determining either the initial date for parole eligibility or an inmate's suitability for parole. The statute does not increase or even apply to the length of incarceration, and therefore does not facially violate the Ex Post Facto Clause. Wool v. Pallito, 207 Vt. 587, 193 A.3d 510 (June 29, 2018).

        In a prosecution for negligent operation of a motor vehicle where defendant was involved in a fatal collision, the sentencing court did not err in finding that the decedent was a victim for purposes of the victim statement statute, and because the decedent could not testify himself, it was appropriate for his mother to testify on his behalf. The sentencing court was within its discretion to consider the causes of the accident that killed the decedent and resulting impact on the decedent's family members. State v.

In addition, the prosecutor's office shall explain the significance of a minimum and maximum sentence to the victim, explain the function of parole and how it may affect the actual amount of time the defendant may be incarcerated, and inform the victim of the maximum amount of earned time that the defendant could accrue and that earned time only affects when a defendant is eligible for parole consideration but does not necessarily result in the defendant's release.

       <p>
        Restitution order requiring defendant to reimburse the victims compensation fund wholesale - without additional findings on the kinds of costs covered or their recipients - was improper because the court conflated an award from the Victims Compensation Board and an award of restitution pursuant to the restitution statute. Given the lack of findings, it was not evident that the compensation awarded by the Victims Compensation Board were for material losses suffered by the victim per the restitution statute. State v.

        "Conduct which is criminal" - that is, conduct that is a crime - "only because of the age of the victim" is exempted from the listed offenses for which conviction renders the defendant a sex offender for purposes of the registry. The crime, a prerequisite to the registration requirement, must be the statutory crime of which the defendant was actually convicted. State v. Stamper, 189 Vt. 583, 15 A.3d 142 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Amendment of sex registration law adding the definition of "conviction" was intended as a clarification of the law, not a substantive change indicating that persons receiving deferred sentences were not previously required to register as sex offenders. State v. Thompson, 174 Vt. 172, 807 A.2d 454 (mem.) (2002).

       <p>
        Defendant, who pleaded nolo contendere to lewd or lascivious conduct with a child, was exempt from sex offender registration. The victim's age was the reason the conduct was criminal, and defendant was under 18 and the victim at least 12 at the time at the time of the conduct in question. State v. Stamper, 189 Vt. 583, 15 A.3d 142 (2011).

       <p>
        Sex offender registration statute applies to an attempt where the defendant believes the victim to be a minor even if the defendant was actually communicating with an adult posing as a minor. Thus, there was no error in requiring defendant, who had communicated with an adult undercover police officer posing as a minor child, to register as a sex offender. State v. Charette, 207 Vt. 372, 189 A.3d 67 (2018).

       The General Assembly finds that some sexual offenders should be subject to increased sex offender registry and community notification procedures. It is the intent of the General Assembly that State's Attorneys utilize the provisions in this section to petition the court to designate those offenders who pose a greater risk to the public as sexually violent predators to ensure that those offenders will be required to register as sex offenders for life, and that they will be among those offenders who are included on the State's Internet Sex Offender Registry.

       Within 15 days after the conviction of a sex offender, the State may file a petition with the court requesting that the person be designated as a sexually violent predator.

       <p>
        Furloughed sex offenders living in the community are not "incarcerated" such that they are excepted from the reporting requirements of the provision which relieves sex offenders from the reporting requirements "during periods of incarceration"; thus, defendant was properly convicted of violating the Sex Offender Registration Act after he knowingly failed to comply with reporting requirements while released on furlough status. This conclusion is based on the common understanding of the term "incarceration," the language and structure of the Sex Offender Registration Act, and the purpose of that law. State v.

         1. Judicial review.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Although the trial court's determination that an inmate could not seek review of his designation as a "high risk" sex offender was erroneous, exactly when the inmate was given notice of his designation remained a question of fact and was improper for disposal on the pleadings. Thus, remand was required to determine whether the inmate received notice of the designation decision such that the limitations period began to run. Rheaume v. Pallito, 190 Vt. 245, 30 A.3d 1263 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        While an inmate may have review of his "high risk" sex offender designation under the rule regarding review of governmental action, the particular programming requirements promulgated after that designation becomes final are a matter of Department of Corrections discretion and as such are not reviewable under the rule. Rheaume v. Pallito, 190 Vt. 245, 30 A.3d 1263 (2011).

         2. Treatment of offenders.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        While the decision to designate a sex offender as highly dangerous could be termed a quasi-judicial act - likely the reason why the Legislature explicitly provided for judicial review of designation decisions - the promulgation of programming requirements falls within the broad discretion of the Department of Corrections to determine what mode of treatment best serves individual inmates. Broad discretion must be granted to correctional authorities to determine what mode of treatment will best serve the individual inmate, and nothing in the statutes limits that discretion. Rheaume v. Pallito, 190 Vt. 245, 30 A.3d 1263 (2011).

         3. Constitutionality.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        With regard to defendant's Ex Post Facto Clause claim, designating defendant "high risk" was for the sole purpose of increasing public access to his status as a sex offender and related information; after the trial court's decision holding that the statute prohibiting early release until 70 percent of a "high risk" offender's maximum sentence was completed violated the Ex Post Facto Clause, that statute had no legal effect on the length of defendant's incarceration; and defendant could point to no statute or administrative directive that retroactively removed or limited the Vermont Department of Corrections' discretion over his treatment programming and that consequently resulted in a longer period of incarceration. Chandler v. Pallito, 203 Vt. 482, 158 A.3d 296 (Sept. 23, 2016).

        Language of the Innocence Protection Act unambiguously limits the trial court's authority to the ordering of DNA analysis of evidence previously obtained and preserved. The Innocence Protection Act consistently refers to the testing of evidence already extant from the underlying case. In re Wiley, 192 Vt. 393, 58 A.3d 966 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Absent ambiguity and a compelling reason to read it otherwise, the plain language of the Innocence Protection Act contemplates DNA analysis only of biological evidence contained within evidence already in hand, rather than testing material not in evidence and yet to be collected.

        Innocence Protection Act specifically requires that the requested testing be of evidence collected during the original investigation of the crime.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        As currently written, the Innocence Protection Act afforded petitioner no right to test the DNA of the victim's mother because the physical sample required was not evidence obtained during the investigation and prosecution of the crimes underlying petitioner's challenged convictions. The Legislature included nothing in the Act to compel seizure of a new evidentiary sample from a nonparty for DNA testing. In re Wiley, 192 Vt. 393, 58 A.3d 966 (2012).

         3. Burden of proof.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Inmate seeking statutory post-conviction DNA testing is not required to show by a preponderance of the evidence that there is a reasonable probability of a different outcome, as the reasonable probability standard is a less onerous one than a preponderance of the evidence standard. In re Towne, 195 Vt. 42, 86 A.3d 429 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the statute allowing for post-conviction DNA testing, a reasonable probability is a probability sufficient to undermine confidence in the outcome, wherein courts concentrate on the overall fairness of the trial and whether the unavailability of the evidence was so unfair as to undermine confidence in the jury's verdict. In re Towne, 195 Vt. 42, 86 A.3d 429 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Post-conviction DNA testing was not warranted of hairs found on a victim's body because the most substantial result the available testing could yield would not sufficiently shake confidence in the jury's verdict in light of the other evidence available to jurors in reaching their decision, such that it would not create a reasonable probability of a different outcome at trial In re Towne, 195 Vt. 42, 86 A.3d 429 (2013).

        The power to assign counsel to represent respondents appearing before courts charged with crime is inherent, and at least as broad as the court's criminal jurisdiction. In re Mears, 124 Vt. 131, 198 A.2d 27 (1964).

        Party who insisted he be represented by an attorney he knew was representing correspondent in related crimes and who voluntarily pleaded guilty to the charges cannot complain of these acts in a later habeas corpus proceeding. In re Shuttle, 125 Vt. 257, 214 A.2d 48 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a trial court appoints or accepts the appearance of a member of the bar in good standing as counsel for defendant in a criminal proceeding, there is a presumption that counsel is competent. In re Murphy, 125 Vt. 272, 214 A.2d 317 (1965).

        Assigned counsel must have sufficient ability and experience to fairly represent the respondent, to present his defense, and to protect his rights. State v. Truman, 124 Vt. 285, 204 A.2d 93 (1964).

        Counsel should be circumspect in accepting employment from more than one respondent in companion cases and courts should be most cautious in making such appointments. State v. Truman, 124 Vt. 285, 204 A.2d 93 (1964).

        The right to challenge appointment of counsel on the basis of diversity of interests may be waived by accused and where a guilty plea is voluntarily made it waives the right to contend that there was a conflict of interest between the respondent and his correspondent. In re Shuttle, 125 Vt. 257, 214 A.2d 48 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        A respondent not under legal disability can waive counsel, if he chooses. In re Mears, 124 Vt. 131, 198 A.2d 27 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        A determination by the trial court that counsel has been waived competently and intelligently will stand unless demonstrated that such waiver was so unjustified as to amount to a deprivation of the respondent's constitutional rights. In re Mears, 124 Vt. 131, 198 A.2d 27 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        A minor, charged with a criminal offense, may waive his right to counsel, when done intelligently with regard to his education, mental capacity, experience and understanding.

       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether a respondent has intelligently waived his right to counsel, the age of the respondent is only one of the factors to be considered. In re Moses, 122 Vt. 36, 163 A.2d 868 (1960), overruled on other grounds, In re Dobson (1965) 125 Vt. 165, 212 A.2d 620.

        Claim of petitioner for post-conviction relief that his court appointed attorney failed to take advantage of alleged defects in initial detention, search, and various complaints filed against him and that this induced him to plead guilty ill-advisedly were insufficient to overturn lower court's finding of competent and adequate representation.

        Although a respondent may remain silent without adverse effect until the accusation of the state is supported by evidence capable of persuading fair-minded triers of the fact that there is no reasonable doubt of the respondent's guilt, when he is confronted with incriminating evidence sufficient to sustain a conviction, he refrains from defending at his peril.

Lizotte (1938) 109 Vt. 378, 197 A. 396, holding that presumption of innocence alone contributes no evidence, has no probative value, is not for consideration of jury, is not proper subject upon which to charge jury, and that all prior cases to the contrary should be disregarded, clearly seem to be superseded by the provisions of this section.

         2. Evidentiary effect of presumption.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In Vermont, the presumption of innocence is, by statute, itself a piece of evidence, to be considered by the jury in the defendant's favor in arriving at their verdict. State v. Camley, 140 Vt. 483, 438 A.2d 1131 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Except for facts which a defendant himself judicially admits, the state's evidence in a criminal trial must always be weighed against the presumption of innocence and any other evidence advanced by the defendant in his favor before the jury can return a general verdict on the merits. State v. Camley, 140 Vt. 483, 438 A.2d 1131 (1981).

       <p>
        Where evidence in a criminal prosecution is entirely circumstantial, it must be sufficient to exclude every reasonable hypothesis consistent with the respondent's innocence and to sustain a verdict of guilty. State v. Fox, 123 Vt. 82, 181 A.2d 74 (1962).

        Where trial court instructed jury that defendant was presumed innocent, that he was under no obligation to present evidence, and that it was the state's burden to prove defendant's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt, taken as a whole, the instructions on the presumption of innocence did not constitute plain error, notwithstanding the fact that the court did not add that the presumption "shall attend the accused until the jury renders a verdict of guilty."

         1. Jeopardy.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        When a criminal charge has been nol prossed and a second prosecution for the same offense has not been brought, respondent is premature in claiming the constitutional protection of double jeopardy as grounds for judgment of acquittal on the first charge. State v. Woodmansee, 124 Vt. 387, 205 A.2d 407 (1964).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prohibition against second jeopardy applies to the same offense rather than the same act. State v. Parker, 123 Vt. 369, 189 A.2d 540 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where one offense is necessary element in, and constitutes part of, another, and both are in fact but one transaction, an acquittal or conviction of one is bar to prosecution for the other. State v. Parker, 123 Vt. 369, 189 A.2d 540 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Same act may constitute two separate crimes, and, if they are not so related that one of them is a constituent part, or necessary element in the other, so that both are in fact one transaction, a prosecution and conviction may be had for each offense. State v. Parker, 123 Vt. 369, 189 A.2d 540 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Nolle prosequi entered by permission of court during trial of criminal cause was not bar to another indictment or information for same offense. State v. Deso, 110 Vt. 1, 1 A.2d 710 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where trial had commenced and evidence was nearly in when one of the jurors was taken sick, and panel was thereupon discharged, prisoner had not been in jeopardy. State v. Emery, 59 Vt. 84, 7 A. 129 (1886).
       </p>
       <p>
        Respondent was not twice in jeopardy, although state's attorney filed information, based on same charges which grand jury had investigated, at same term, and had failed to find an indictment. State v. Whipple, 57 Vt. 637 (1885).
       </p>
       <p>
        When an assault and battery had been made upon two, and both were wounded by same stroke, and offender had been legally convicted before a court of competent jurisdiction for breach of peace in assault and battery upon the one, indictment could not afterwards be maintained against him for an assault and battery upon the other. State v. Damon, 2 Tyl. 387 (1803).

      In the prosecution of an offense committed upon, or in relation to, or in any way affecting real estate, or an offense committed in stealing, embezzling, injuring, or fraudulently receiving or concealing money or other personal estate, it shall be sufficient and not deemed a variance if it is proved on trial that, at the time when the offense was committed, the actual or constructive possession, or the general or special property in whole or in part of such real or personal estate was in the person alleged in the complaint, information, or indictment to be the owner thereof.

        Where an information for burglary charged that property in question was in possession of one C., it was not error to permit an amendment, at close of state's evidence, charging ownership as well as possession of property to have been that of C. State v. Nelson, 91 Vt. 168, 99 A. 881 (1917).

       <p>
        Evidence of taking of hens from henhouse of alleged owner showed his possession of hens and supported allegation of ownership in him, precluding a variance. State v. Hodgdon, 89 Vt. 148, 94 A. 301 (1915), same case 89 Vt. 510, 96 A. 4.

        An information for burglariously entering with intent to steal need not allege ownership of property intended to be stolen, and such allegation was therefore surplusage. State v. Hodgdon, 89 Vt. 148, 94 A. 301 (1915), same case 89 Vt. 510, 96 A. 4.

      When an intent to defraud is required to constitute a criminal offense, it shall be sufficient to allege in the complaint, information, or indictment an intent to defraud, without naming the person or body corporate intended to be defrauded. On trial it shall be sufficient and shall not be deemed a variance if there appears to have been an intent to defraud the United States, a state, county, town, city, district, a body corporate, a public officer in his or her official capacity, a partnership or members thereof, or a person.

        Unless the court exercises its discretion to permit the introduction of evidence on the question of respondent's insanity, where the forty-eight hour notice under this section was not given, the issue of respondent's mental condition does not arise because of the exclusion of evidence on such condition and it follows that there is no issue to present to the jury.

        By an alibi the accused attempts to prove that he was at a place so distant from the scene of the offense that his participation in the crime was impossible; he undertakes to show that because he was not at the scene of the crime at the time of its commission, having been at another place at the time, he could not have committed the crime.

        Evidence of defendant's wife, called as defense witness, as to time that defendant returned on day of alleged crime under this section, was not excludable, as constituting evidence of alibi as to which proper notice had not been given where information alleged no time or particular place where offense occurred and exact time of alleged offense was not of essence thereof.

       </h5>
       <p>
        In two domestic assault cases, defendant was not allowed to withdraw his guilty pleas because he was advised that deportation was a risk of pleading guilty, as required by statute and the Vermont Rules of Criminal Procedure; the use of the phrase "affect your ability to remain in the country" conveyed the meaning of deportation. Substantial compliance with the Rule was all that was required, and defendant unequivocally stated during the plea colloquies that he understood the court's advisements. State v. Mendez, 201 Vt. 376, 143 A.3d 558 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        In accepting a guilty plea, the trial court adequately informed defendant of the potential immigration consequences of his conviction, as it properly identified the specific consequences of the possibilities of deportation or denial of citizenship; there was no substantive difference between the phrase "may have the consequences of" as used in the statute, and the phrases "could have an impact on" and "could lead to" as spoken by the trial judge. It was not required to inform him that he was subject to automatic denial of citizenship. State v. Mutwale, 194 Vt. 258, 79 A.3d 850 (2013).

        Although defendant argued that by asking defendant's wife if she had evidence to dispute the allegations against her husband, the State commented on his silence, in violation of the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution, Chapter I, Article 10 of the Vermont Constitution and 13 V.S.A.
        §
        6601 and that the court's curative instruction was insufficient to remedy the harm caused, and that his convictions must therefore be reversed, the court promptly instructed the jury that the State bore the burden of proof, and that defendant had no obligation to present any evidence to disprove the allegations; whether or not the question asked of defendant's wife was improper, the court's instructions were sufficient to correct any possible prejudice. State v. Powers, 163 Vt. 98, 655 A.2d 712 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        The prosecution may not in any way comment on a defendant's failure to testify, both under this section and federal constitutional law. State v. Shattuck, 141 Vt. 523, 450 A.2d 1122 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant did not testify, it was improper and impermissible comment for prosecutor to emphatically state, in argument to the jury, that the testimony of police officers and expert witnesses was unrebutted evidence. State v. Rocheleau, 131 Vt. 563, 313 A.2d 33 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        While an instruction to the jury by the court, sua sponte, which refers to respondent's failure to testify but which points out that his silence is not to be held against him or considered as evidence against him is not reversible error, the better procedure is for the trial court to ascertain the position of the respondent who has not testified to determine whether he desires that the instruction be given and then give the instruction only when it is requested by him. State v. Emrick, 129 Vt. 330, 278 A.2d 712 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        In absence of request by defendant to explain his right of silence, trial court should have abstained from any comment concerning defendant's competency as a witness and his choice not to testify. State v. Grant, 127 Vt. 168, 243 A.2d 767 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where respondent failed to testify it was proper for court to direct and admonish jury in the language of this section. State v. Goyet, 120 Vt. 12, 132 A.2d 623 (1957).

       <p>
        Instruction to jury, after stating that statute made respondent competent witness at his request, that credit to be given his testimony rested solely with jury to give it weight to which jury thought it entitled, but that it was obvious that if respondent goes upon stand, it is because he desires and intends that his evidence shall make in his favor, and shall tend to shield him or her from consequences of charges made against him, was without error. State v. Stacy, 104 Vt. 379, 160 A. 257 (1932); State v. Daley, 53 Vt. 442 (1881); State v. Bean, 119 Vt. 184, 122 A.2d 744 (1956). But see State v. Bean, supra, suggesting that in future trial part of standard charge beginning with "It is obvious" be omitted as giving state advantage.

        Failure of court to instruct jury that defendant's decision not to testify should not be considered as evidence against him, once court undertook to point out fact that defendant had not taken the stand, although this section made him or her competent to do so, was prejudicial.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Statute prohibiting comment on a defendant's failure to testify prohibits only comments that would invite negative inference and allows instruction that the jury should make no inference. It is not a violation of the statute for the court to give a cautionary instruction, even if not requested by the defendant. State v. Martin, 182 Vt. 377, 944 A.2d 867 (Sept. 7, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Absent any showing of actual prejudice, while the preferred practice would be to follow the defendant's tactical election, a cautionary instruction concerning a defendant's failure to testify when correctly given is not prejudicial error. State v. Martin, 182 Vt. 377, 944 A.2d 867 (Sept. 7, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Judgment upon conviction of breaking and entering into a dwelling house in the nighttime would be reversed and the case remanded for a new trial where defendant did not take the stand to testify in his defense, the court asked him or her if he wished the court to instruct the jury as to his right to not testify and as to statute providing that failure to testify shall not be a matter of comment to the jury by the court or prosecutor and shall not be considered by the jury as evidence against the defendant, and court, though it receive an affirmative answer from defendant, failed to give the instruction. State v. Persuitti, 133 Vt. 464, 346 A.2d 208 (1975).

       <p>
        Where defendant, who was convicted of aggravated assault, made no request to be allowed to testify at his trial, did not move to have his attorney removed from the case and did not assert his claimed denial of his right to testify on a prior appeal to the supreme court or in his petition for post-conviction relief to the superior court, defendant acquiesced in his counsel's advice not to testify and thereby waived that right.

        Purpose of an order under this section is to restrain witnesses from tailoring their testimony to that of earlier witnesses, aid in detecting testimony which is less than candid, and prevent attempts to influence testimony of a witness during a recess; order's object is not to segregate the witnesses from counsel who called them.

       <p>
        Under this section it was not error to refuse to exclude sheriff from court room, who was in attendance upon court as an officer, although he was a material witness; nor could it be held that it was legal error to put him in charge of jury as no injury was shown in consequence.

    <p>
     Since a summons issued pursuant to this subchapter is a drastic procedure which represents an incursion upon the liberty of a prospective witness who is accused of no crime or wrongdoing, the right of the state requesting the summons to hear the testimony of an out-of-state witness must be balanced against the right of the witness whose presence is compelled. In re Stoddard, 144 Vt. 6, 470 A.2d 1185 (1983).

        Section is not inconsistent with, and so is not repealed by, the municipal court act (12 V.S.A.
        §
        1505), providing that a respondent, tried in a municipal court for an offense within the jurisdiction of the court, shall be entitled to a jury of twelve. State v. Hirsch, 91 Vt. 330, 100 A. 877 (1917).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        It is the first requirement of a judgment by confession that the plea of guilty be voluntarily entered with full understanding of its consequences. In re Lamphere, 127 Vt. 604, 256 A.2d 29 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where judgment is by confession, the record should confirm that the guilty plea was voluntarily entered with full understanding of the consequences. In re Lamphere, 127 Vt. 604, 256 A.2d 29 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        A guilty plea unfairly obtained through ignorance, fear or misunderstanding is open to collateral attack. In re Lamphere, 127 Vt. 604, 256 A.2d 29 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Neither this section nor article 10, chapter I of the Vermont constitution make it mandatory that a plea of guilty be made personally by an accused. In re Southard, 125 Vt. 405, 217 A.2d 49 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        An attorney cannot enter a plea of guilty in the presence of his client without his consent. In re Southard, 125 Vt. 405, 217 A.2d 49 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where accused is present and indicates his approval or acquiescence by silence to a plea of guilty made for him by his attorney, he must accept the consequences of the plea. In re Southard, 125 Vt. 405, 217 A.2d 49 (1966).

         4. Change of plea.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where, following guilty plea and subsequent recommendation of sentence by state's attorney, it became apparent that accused and his counsel had misunderstood the proposed recommendation of the state's attorney, and the court afforded accused adequate opportunity to change his plea and stand trial, and accused, with the assistance of counsel whose competence he avowed, allowed the guilty plea to stand, his right to present his defense in a jury trial was fully safeguarded with ample opportunity to assert it, and he was not entitled to vacation of his sentence upon petition for post-conviction relief. In re Lamphere, 127 Vt. 604, 256 A.2d 29 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Protection of constitutional rights requires liberality in the exercise of discretion to permit an accused to withdraw a plea of guilty before sentencing and have a jury trial. In re Newton, 125 Vt. 453, 218 A.2d 394 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        Apparent guilt or innocence of the accused is a factor to be considered by the trial judge in acting on a motion to withdraw a plea of guilty before sentencing. In re Newton, 125 Vt. 453, 218 A.2d 394 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where respondent was induced to enter a plea of guilty because of statements by his attorney concerning the sentence that would be imposed, he should be permitted to change his plea to not guilty before sentencing when informed by his attorney that the judge intends to impose a more severe sentence than had been contemplated. In re Newton, 125 Vt. 453, 218 A.2d 394 (1966).

       </h5>
       <p>
        It is essential to the courts' functions of safeguarding the public interest and protecting an accused against unfair disadvantage that when a court is informed that a plea was subject to or influenced by prior discussions and agreement on the part of the prosecutor and defense counsel, accused should, before acceptance of the plea, be personally advised that the prosecutor's concessions are not binding on the court, and it should appear from in-court inquiry that the plea was not inadvisably induced by unjustified assumptions on the part of accused. In re Lamphere, 127 Vt. 604, 256 A.2d 29 (1969).

         1. Sentence.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Vermont Code directs that each sentence, whether concurrent or consecutive, shall run from its respective date of commitment under sentence, and that a sentence shall commence to run when the defendant enters the correctional facility for that sentence. These provisions mean that a criminal sentence of incarceration begins on the date of incarceration and not before. Fleming-Pancione v. Menard, 205 Vt. 125, 171 A.3d 1020 (July 7, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court must reconcile statutes and eliminate a conflict if possible, and the most reasonable way to do so is to interpret the provision stating "When terms run concurrently, the shorter minimum terms merge in and are satisfied by serving the longest minimum and the shorter maximum terms merge in and are satisfied by discharge of the longest maximum term" to apply only if the concurrent sentences commence on the same date or are expected to do so. In this way, the terms fully run concurrently rather than simply overlapping and the start dates for each of those sentences are those specified in other provisions. Fleming-Pancione v. Menard, 205 Vt. 125, 171 A.3d 1020 (July 7, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the difference between the minimum and maximum terms - amounting to a minimum term that is over 98 percent of the maximum term - was so minimal as to effectively be nonexistent, the legislative intent and purpose behind the indeterminate sentencing law was not met, and remand for resentencing was required. State v. Delaoz, 189 Vt. 385, 22 A.3d 388 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Same logic behind the Court's invalidation of identical minimum and maximum terms necessitates a similar proscription against any sentence where the interval between the minimum and maximum terms is so small as to effectively amount to a circumvention of the indeterminate sentence law. State v. Delaoz, 189 Vt. 385, 22 A.3d 388 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court did not abuse its discretion in sentencing defendant to twenty-year maximum, eighteen-year minimum, sentence, despite the slight difference between the two terms, where such a sentence was within the respective limits set by law. State v. Bushway, 146 Vt. 405, 505 A.2d 660 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sentence of from six to seven years for assisting a felon to escape arrest and punishment, a felony punishable by up to seven years' imprisonment, did not violate spirit and intent of statute providing that the court shall not set the term of imprisonment unless such term is definitely set by statute, but shall set a maximum and may set a minimum, to be, respectively, not more than the longest term nor less than the shortest term, set by law for the offense. Woodmansee v. Stoneman, 133 Vt. 449, 344 A.2d 26 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        A respondent sentenced to the county jail for a minimum and maximum term must serve his legal sentence, namely, the maximum term, unless he is sooner pardoned or conditionally paroled by the governor. In re Ronan, 108 Vt. 481, 188 A. 890 (1937); In re Conditional Discharge of Convicts, 73 Vt. 414, 51 A. 10 (1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        Relator was not entitled to discharge from a sentence because he had been confined beyond the minimum term. In re Ronan, 108 Vt. 481, 188 A. 890 (1937).

        2011 amendment to the indeterminate sentence statute, which provides that a sentence shall not be considered fixed as long as the maximum and minimum terms are not identical, was a clarification of the law, and therefore the amendment applied to defendant's sentence. Because the minimum and maximum terms of defendant's sentence were not identical, defendant was not sentenced to an impermissible fixed term. State v. Burke, 192 Vt. 99, 54 A.3d 500 (2012), cert. denied, 568 U.S. 1072, 133 S. Ct. 795, 184 L. Ed. 2d 588 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Surrounding circumstances indicate that adding the sentence, "A sentence shall not be considered fixed as long as the maximum and minimum terms are not identical," to the statute regarding minimum and maximum terms was intended to clarify or correct the law's meaning rather than change it. Accordingly, the amendment applied to defendant's sentence, and thus defeated his claim that he was sentenced to an impermissible fixed term. State v. Kenvin, 191 Vt. 30, 38 A.3d 26 (2011).

       <p>
        Presentence credit provided for by Blondin and LeClair and the statute governing form of sentences is awarded for the time a person is incarcerated as a result of the conduct on which the sentence is ultimately based. Both the current version of the statute and the previous version make this clear. There is simply no provision in the statute or the applicable case law for credit for incarceration before arrest on an unrelated offense. Fleming-Pancione v. Menard, 205 Vt. 125, 171 A.3d 1020 (July 7, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Rule adopted in
        State v. Kenvin,
        2013 VT 104, to the extent that it permitted credit for home detention outside the statutory programs for home confinement and electronic monitoring, is overruled; a bright-line rule that a defendant who is released pretrial under a curfew established by conditions of release and who is later sentenced to jail time is not entitled to credit for the time spent on curfew under conditions of release is adopted. State v. Byam, 205 Vt. 173, 172 A.3d 171 (June 9, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Formal custody by the Department of Corrections is not required to satisfy the statutory custody requirement for purposes of sentence credit. State v. Byam, 205 Vt. 173, 172 A.3d 171 (June 9, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Nonstatutory home detention with a condition-of-release curfew is never deemed sufficiently akin to penal incarceration to justify credit against one's sentence. State v. Byam, 205 Vt. 173, 172 A.3d 171 (June 9, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was not entitled to credit against his sentence for pretrial 24-hour curfew with exceptions, as there was no guarantee that he was in fact compliant with the curfew, he was not "in custody" for that purpose, and it was not sufficiently akin to penal incarceration to justify credit. State v. Byam, 205 Vt. 173, 172 A.3d 171 (June 9, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        "In custody," for purposes of credit towards service of a sentence, by judicial precedent created a rule under which the trial courts, in reviewing a convicted defendant's claim for credit, consider whether the individual's pretrial conditions of release were so restrictive as to be tantamount to either institutional confinement or home detention. State v. Byam, 205 Vt. 173, 172 A.3d 171 (June 9, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutory phrase "in custody" requires that a defendant be subject to the physical control of the Department of Corrections or of a court-ordered treatment facility for purposes of credit for pretrial release conditions. State v. Byam, 205 Vt. 173, 172 A.3d 171 (June 9, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        When defendant received a sentence of two-to-five years for 2012 offenses, to be served concurrently with his controlling three-to-five-year sentence for a 2010 burglary conviction, he was entitled to credit against both sentences for the time he was incarcerated following his arrest on the new charges. State v. Leclair, 195 Vt. 295, 88 A.3d 1186 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was not eligible for credit for his continuing release on modified conditions, which relegated him to his home but allowed him to travel to a cell-phone-reception area, attend appointments, and walk his dog, as he was allowed substantial freedom in movement at his discretion. Furthermore, the conditions were not the equivalent of home detention. State v. Kenvin, 195 Vt. 166, 87 A.3d 454 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the conditions of release required defendant to stay in his home at all times without exception, he was entitled to credit for time spent in "custody," as he was constrained to a single place and was not allowed any discretionary movement or travel. State v. Kenvin, 195 Vt. 166, 87 A.3d 454 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        There are several ways that a trial court can determine whether a defendant has received proper sentence credit for any days spent in custody in connection with the offense for which sentence was imposed. First, the sentencing court can decide that calculation of the time served involves a legal question that is best resolved by the court, and it can specify the extent of the credit, if any; second, the trial court can leave the sentence calculation to the Commissioner of Corrections, under which the normal remedy to challenge the Commissioner's conclusion would be an appeal to the Civil Division of the Superior Court; and third, the sentence can be reviewed to determine whether it is illegal because it fails to give defendant credit for days spent in custody in connection with the crime(s) for which defendant is sentenced. State v. Sommer, 190 Vt. 236, 27 A.3d 1059 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant, who was arraigned on new charges while he was serving the remaining part of a previous sentence in the community, argued that he should receive credit for time served against his second sentence minimum, thereby reducing his overall minimum by 13 months. By requesting that the 13 months now be credited against his aggregated minimum, however, defendant was really asking that the time be credited to both his new minimum as well as to his old maximum, thus creating an impermissible double credit situation. State v. Sommer, 190 Vt. 236, 27 A.3d 1059 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant failed in his argument that the eight-to-nine-year sentence imposed by the court was illegal because the minimum and maximum sentences imposed were effectively the same when taking into consideration his good-time-credit reduction; however, nothing in this section requires the court to consider the effect of good-time credit at sentencing. State v. Stanley, 182 Vt. 565, 933 A.2d 184 (mem.) (July 16, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Period of incarceration following the date that defendant reached the minimum term of his first sentence was properly credited toward the first sentence; that time could not be credited against a second sentence imposed consecutively to the first sentence. Martel v. Lanman, 171 Vt. 547, 759 A.2d 65 (mem.) (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant did not post bail simply because it would not have resulted in his being freed from custody and he made no showing whatsoever that his failure to post bail on assault charge resulted in more restrictive confinement than what would have been imposed upon revocation of his parole had he made bail on assault charge, defendant would not be rewarded by receiving double credit for jail time between imposition of the first and second sentence. State v. Blondin, 164 Vt. 55, 665 A.2d 587 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The plain meaning of 13 V.S.A.
        §
        7031(b) does not require that parole violators who are jailed and do not make bail on new charges be given double credit for time served before imposition of either the new or the underlying sentence, whichever comes later, even if the sentences are imposed consecutively; such an irrational result would be contrary to the view of the vast majority of courts construing virtually identical statutes in similar situations, and, more importantly, it would undermine the trial court's ability to impose consecutive sentences, and would provide incentives for both defendants and the State to try to manipulate the timing of judicial proceedings so as to shorten or lengthen the ultimate sentence served. State v. Blondin, 164 Vt. 55, 665 A.2d 587 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a defendant is incarcerated based on conduct that leads both to revocation of probation or parole and to conviction on new charges, the time spent in jail before the second sentence is imposed should be credited toward only the first sentence if the second sentence is imposed consecutively, but toward both sentences if the second sentence is imposed concurrently. State v. Blondin, 164 Vt. 55, 665 A.2d 587 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont law, which requires credit for jail time served involving the offense for which the sentence was imposed, entitles persons to only a single credit for prior jail time when there are sentences to be served consecutively. In re Duff, 161 Vt. 599, 641 A.2d 94 (mem.) (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant who was given four consecutive sentences in connection with kidnapping and sexual assault was not entitled to credit for ten years spent in custody for each of the four sentences, for a total of forty years' credit; since sentences were consecutive, a single credit of ten years was properly given for pretrial detention. State v. Percy, 158 Vt. 410, 612 A.2d 1119 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        During two and one-half year period prior to sentencing and incarceration, defendant was not in custody for purposes of sentencing credit where conditions of release required defendant to remain in county where he lived, be at his residence seven hours each night, and check in with probation officers three times a week. State v. Platt, 158 Vt. 423, 610 A.2d 139 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a Vermont defendant seeks presentence for days spent in custody in another jurisdiction, he bears the burden of establishing that the charge on which sentence is imposed was the sole basis for the custody at issue. State v. Coe, 150 Vt. 448, 554 A.2d 656 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant was incarcerated in New York on a charge that led to revocation of his probation, he was entitled to sentence credit for all days he spent in custody in New York awaiting return to Vermont following completion of his New York sentence. State v. Coe, 150 Vt. 448, 554 A.2d 656 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme court was not disposed to transfer the concept of custody involved in measuring the responsibilities of an enforcement officer for escape of a prisoner or the definition of custody justifying habeas corpus jurisdiction to concept of custody in issue of credit to be given for days spent in custody pursuant to subsec. (b) of this section; similarly, supreme court would not treat custody so uniformly that a release in the custody of a parent which permits living at home becomes indistinguishable from a release in the custody of the commissioner of corrections for institutional confinement. In re McPhee, 141 Vt. 4, 442 A.2d 1285 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether restrictions imposed pursuant to pretrial release support credit for time served in custody pursuant to subsec. (b) of this section, each case must receive an independent determination of the facts. In re McPhee, 141 Vt. 4, 442 A.2d 1285 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Question as to whether the restraints involved in case of defendant released pursuant to a pretrial order which required an unsecured appearance bond in the sum of $50,000.00, residence at a residential alcohol treatment facility, confinement to and subjection to supervision of that facility, monthly reports from the facility, abstention from alcoholic beverages, and forbiddance of possession of firearms, were sufficient as a matter of law to bring into play the credit provision for days spent in custody pursuant to subsec. (b) of this section, was a determination to be made solely in the light of the factual nature of the custody. In re McPhee, 141 Vt. 4, 442 A.2d 1285 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Lower court's decision to award credit to defendant pursuant to subsec. (b) of this section for time served in custody was fully supportable where defendant's pretrial release order required an unsecured appearance bond in the sum of $50,000.00, residence at a residential alcohol treatment facility, confinement to and subjection to supervision of that facility, monthly reports from the facility, abstention from alcoholic beverages, and forbiddance of possession of firearms, since defendant's freedom was much more restricted than that of one who walked out of a courtroom having furnished bail. In re McPhee, 141 Vt. 4, 442 A.2d 1285 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where petitioner was originally convicted on November 29, 1978, and at that time the trial court imposed a four- to eight-year sentence, suspending all but six months to one year, on March 12, 1979, petitioner was released on probation, and on July 6, 1979, petitioner was arrested for another offense, which was unrelated to the first crime committed the year before, and for which petitioner was convicted and sentenced to four to eight months, the time spent in custody on the bail mittimus resulting from the 1979 offense could be properly credited to the sentence imposed for that offense but could not be credited to the sentence imposed for the 1978 offense since it had no relation to, nor any connection with, the 1978 offense or the resulting sentence. Marden v. Walton, 142 Vt. 204, 455 A.2d 321 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        The time served by petitioner under a bail mittimus for a 1979 offense had no connection whatever with the sentence imposed for an earlier 1978 offense since he had not been serving the sentence at the time he was charged for the 1979 offense, and since a revocation of the probation under which petitioner was released for the 1978 offense could be effected only by establishing a violation, which could not be charged unless and until a conviction for the 1979 offense was obtained; therefore, the trial court erred in granting petitioner's motion for summary judgment and awarding him the time spent in jail on the bail mittimus as a credit against his original sentence. Marden v. Walton, 142 Vt. 204, 455 A.2d 321 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plain meaning of this section is that if conditions of release are imposed in connection with a charge and the conditions are not met, then the time spent in custody is in connection with the offense charged. In re Zera, 137 Vt. 421, 406 A.2d 396 (1979), overruled on other grounds, State v. Blondin (1995) 164 Vt. 55, 665 A.2d 587.
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant who was released on personal recognizance and refused to accept the release and surrendered himself to the court and was remanded without mittimus to the Commissioner of Corrections could not have been released from the court's order remanding him to the commissioner until the conditions imposed were either complied with or amended, and thus his continued custody, even absent a written mittimus, was in part attributable to the underlying charge of escape from confinement. In re Zera, 137 Vt. 421, 406 A.2d 396 (1979), overruled on other grounds, State v. Blondin (1995) 164 Vt. 55, 665 A.2d 587.
       </p>
       <p>
        Where prisoner was arraigned on charge of failure to return from furlough, released on personal recognizance, rejected personal recognizance, surrendered himself to the court, was remanded without mittimus to the Commissioner of Corrections, and was denied credit for time spent in custody between arraignment on the escape charge and time he was committed for observation to evaluate his sanity, superior court, on petition for post-conviction relief, incorrectly ruled that nonacceptance of release on personal recognizance had no effect and that since bail mittimus had not issued he was not in custody in connection with the escape charge within meaning of statute granting credit for time spent in custody in connection with the offense for which sentence was imposed; prisoner was eligible for credit against escape charge, because there was a failure to abide by conditions of release imposed in connection with that offense, and that he was already in custody on a prior conviction did not prevent his being eligible for credit against the escape charge. In re Zera, 137 Vt. 421, 406 A.2d 396 (1979), overruled on other grounds, State v. Blondin (1995) 164 Vt. 55, 665 A.2d 587.
       </p>
       <p>
        The courts must give a person credit toward service of his sentence for any days spent in custody in connection with the offense for which sentence was imposed and this applies to time spent in detention under bail mittimus prior to sentence for the offense charged. In re Lampman, 135 Vt. 226, 373 A.2d 547 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if the act amending the sentencing credit statute was enacted in response to decisions by the Vermont Supreme Court, that fact would not indicate any legislative intent to apply the act retroactively; nor does the court find any other indication that the legislature intended for the act to apply retrospectively. Absent the most clear and unequivocal language, a statute affecting legally existing rights should not be construed retrospectively. State v. Aubuchon, 195 Vt. 571, 90 A.3d 914 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that the act amending the sentencing credit statute, by its own terms, became effective immediately upon passage alone does not indicate that the legislature intended the act to apply retrospectively. State v. Aubuchon, 195 Vt. 571, 90 A.3d 914 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the rule in Blondin, given that defendant's convictions on the second set of charges were imposed consecutively to his initial sentence, he was not entitled to double credit for the time he was incarcerated following his arrest on the second set of charges, notwithstanding that his furlough status on the initial conviction was not revoked. State v. Aubuchon, 195 Vt. 571, 90 A.3d 914 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Act amending the sentencing credit statute appears to have been enacted as a comprehensive revision of sentencing law regarding credit for time served rather than as a direct response to specific case law. In any event, the act cannot be viewed as merely clarifying the meaning of the prior statutes. State v. Aubuchon, 195 Vt. 571, 90 A.3d 914 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the statute regarding sentencing credits was amended after defendant was sentenced on all pending charges and, in any case, neither defined an offense nor prescribed a punishment, the earlier version of the statute governed his case. State v. Aubuchon, 195 Vt. 571, 90 A.3d 914 (2014).

        Defendant failed in his argument that his sentence was illegal because reducing the maximum sentence through good-time credits under 28 V.S.A.

       If a person who has been sentenced to a term or terms of imprisonment is convicted of another offense punishable by imprisonment before he or she has been discharged from the former sentence or sentences, the court may sentence him or her to an additional term of imprisonment and shall specify whether this additional term shall be served concurrent with or consecutive to the prior sentence or sentences.
      </li>
      <li id="t13p05c221sub02s7032ol1b">
       In any case where a person is convicted of two or more offenses punishable by imprisonment and is sentenced for more than one of these offenses, he or she may be sentenced to as many terms as there are offenses of which he or she is convicted.
    When such multiple sentences are imposed they shall run concurrent with or consecutive to each other as the court determines at the time of sentencing and each shall run from its respective date of commitment after sentence.
    When such multiple sentences are in addition to a prior sentence or sentences from which the person has not yet been discharged, they shall run concurrently with or consecutive to any prior sentence or sentences as the court shall determine at the time of sentencing.
      </li>
      <li id="t13p05c221sub02s7032ol1c">

        <li id="t13p05c221sub02s7032ol1c1">

         When terms run consecutively, the minimum terms are added to arrive at an aggregate minimum to be served equal to the sum of all minimum terms and the maximum terms are added to arrive at an aggregate maximum equal to the sum of all maximum terms. A person shall serve no more time on consecutive minimum sentences than the sum of the minimum terms, regardless of whether the sentences are imposed on the same or different dates. If a person has served a minimum term and subsequently incurs another criminal charge, the time the person spends in custody awaiting disposition of the new charge shall count toward the minimum term of the new sentence, if one is imposed. This subdivision shall not require the Department of Corrections to release a person from incarceration to community supervision at the person's minimum term.

         1. Common law.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Under this section, which embodies the common law, two or more sentences simultaneously imposed run concurrently unless record expressly shows that they are to be consecutive. State v. Kasper, 137 Vt. 184, 404 A.2d 85 (1979), overruled in part by State v. Discola, 2018 VT 7, 207 Vt. 216, 184 A.3d 1177.
       </p>
       <p>
        Section providing for cumulative sentences of a person convicted of two or more crimes, one term of imprisonment limited to commence at the expiration of the other, is merely declarative of the common law. In re Sargood, 86 Vt. 130, 83 A. 718 (1912).
       </p>
       <p>
        At common law, where respondent, already in execution on a sentence to imprisonment, is brought into court and convicted of another, or several other, distinct offenses, the court may lawfully impose sentence of imprisonment against him to take effect at the expiration of the term he is then serving, and if there be a third conviction for which a sentence of imprisonment is imposed, the term of that imprisonment may be made to commence at the expiration of the preceding sentence. In re Sargood, 86 Vt. 130, 83 A. 718 (1912).

         2. Constitutionality.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where defendant was convicted under liquor law for selling liquor on 307 occasions and was fined $20 for each offense totaling with costs $6,638 and was sentenced to 19,914 days in prison, or three days for each dollar, sentence was not cruel or unusual within constitutional prohibition, since it does not apply to cumulative punishments imposed for distinct offenses in the same prosecution. State v. O'Neil, 58 Vt. 140, 20 A. 586 (1885), appeal dismissed as not presenting federal question, see 144 U.S. 323, 12 S. Ct. 693, 36 L. Ed. 450, 59 Harv. L. Rev. 1162.

         3. Computation of terms.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Vermont Code directs that each sentence, whether concurrent or consecutive, shall run from its respective date of commitment under sentence, and that a sentence shall commence to run when the defendant enters the correctional facility for that sentence. These provisions mean that a criminal sentence of incarceration begins on the date of incarceration and not before. Fleming-Pancione v. Menard, 205 Vt. 125, 171 A.3d 1020 (July 7, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court must reconcile statutes and eliminate a conflict if possible, and the most reasonable way to do so is to interpret the provision stating "When terms run concurrently, the shorter minimum terms merge in and are satisfied by serving the longest minimum and the shorter maximum terms merge in and are satisfied by discharge of the longest maximum term" to apply only if the concurrent sentences commence on the same date or are expected to do so. In this way, the terms fully run concurrently rather than simply overlapping and the start dates for each of those sentences are those specified in other provisions. Fleming-Pancione v. Menard, 205 Vt. 125, 171 A.3d 1020 (July 7, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Consecutive sentences are to be aggregated before partial or total suspension of any of the sentences is taken into account; after the sentences are aggregated, the fact that some of the sentences may be partially or completely suspended is considered to compute the manner in which a defendant will serve the aggregated sentences. St. Gelais v. Walton, 150 Vt. 245, 552 A.2d 782 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section's provision that when prison terms run consecutively the maximum terms are added together to arrive at an aggregate maximum, where first of two sentences never began to run because of its expiration before issuance of mittimus, it was not error to fail to compute sentence by adding together the two maximums. In re Perry, 137 Vt. 168, 400 A.2d 1013 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        When accused is sentenced to imprisonment for successive terms and the first sentence is reversed, or is shortened by a pardon, the second term begins to run from the reversal or pardon of the first. 1938 Op. Atty. Gen. 259.
       </p>
       <p>
        Where person receives more than one sentence not to run concurrently, the second sentence imposed would begin at the expiration of the maximum term of the sentence first imposed, giving credit to the prisoner in the final computation of his sentence of the deduction allowed for good behavior. 1938 Op. Atty. Gen. 255.

         4. Subsequent convictions.

       <p>
        Where respondent was convicted of two offenses and given cumulative sentences of imprisonment thereon, and before the expiration of those sentences was convicted of third offense and thereon given sentence that was limited to begin at expiration of second, he was not denied due process of law. In re Sargood, 86 Vt. 130, 83 A. 718 (1912).
       </p>
       <p>
        Section, providing that respondent convicted of two or more offenses punishable by imprisonment, and sentenced at the same time for more than one of them, may be sentenced to as many terms of imprisonment as there are offenses for which he is convicted, one term being limited to commence at the expiration of the other, does not limit the imposition of cumulative sentences to the term of court at which the first sentence is imposed, but the courts have still the common law power to impose such sentences at a subsequent term.

       <p>
        When a prisoner on probation is convicted of a subsequent offense, criterion imposed by subsec. (a) of this section, that a subsequent conviction must occur before the defendant has been discharged from a prior sentence, must be read with reference to sections 251 and 255 of Title 28, governing duration of and discharge from probation; together, they permit a subsequent court, in its discretion, to impose a sentence consecutive to probation. In re Hough, 143 Vt. 15, 458 A.2d 1134 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unless probation has been terminated as outlined in sections 251 and 255 of Title 28, governing duration of and discharge from probation, a probationer is not yet discharged from that prior sentence for purposes of subsec. (a) of this section. In re Hough, 143 Vt. 15, 458 A.2d 1134 (1983).

        Where plaintiff was sentenced on December 20, 1976, to serve seven to ten years in one case, and on February 7, 1977, was given a consecutive sentence of ten to fifteen years in another case, and three years later, on February 26, 1980, the conviction in the first case was overturned and on that date the commissioner of corrections started the sentence running on the second case, and on January 9, 1981, the plaintiff was given a reduced sentence of four to five years in the first case, to run concurrently, the trial court erred in denying plaintiff's petition for declaratory and injunctive relief requiring the commissioner of corrections to give him credit towards the second sentence for the time spent in custody between February 7, 1977, and February 26, 1980, since once the first sentence was overturned, the second sentence was no longer consecutive and should not have been treated as such; since upon resentencing in the first case, the sentences were changed to be concurrent, and thus the subsections of this section were not applicable; and since, under section provided, concurrent sentences were merged in one another, and under section 7031 of this title each day of time served was to be credited to both sentences.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Subsec. (a) of this section creates three criteria which must be satisfied before the court can impose consecutive sentences: the offender must already have been sentenced to a term or terms of imprisonment; he must commit another crime punishable by imprisonment; and the subsequent conviction must occur before the defendant has been discharged from the prior sentence. In re Hough, 143 Vt. 15, 458 A.2d 1134 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsec. (a) of this section imposes no requirement that the person still be in execution of the prior sentence before a consecutive sentence may be imposed for a subsequent offense. In re Hough, 143 Vt. 15, 458 A.2d 1134 (1983).

        Trial court properly held that it lacked the authority to terminate defendant's probation obligations and expunge his criminal convictions halfway through his stipulated deferred-sentence term, as the term of deferment could not be shortened without the State's consent, and allowing defendant to escape the agreement's burden after he had benefitted from it would not advance the ends of justice.

        General reference to further order of court in defendant's deferred sentence agreement did not authorize court to extend duration of her probation despite very specific durational limit in the agreement and in court's order. State v. Murray, 159 Vt. 198, 617 A.2d 135 (1992).

        The Double Jeopardy Clause does not require that a sentence be given a degree of finality that prevents its later increase under subsec. (b) of this section. State v. Boyer, 144 Vt. 393, 481 A.2d 15 (1984).

       <p>
        Defendant's sentence did not need to be modified pursuant to statutory procedure because trial court had not signed mittimus before continued sentencing hearing, and thus execution of sentence had not begun; court was therefore free to modify its earlier pronouncement, which did not reflect its intent to ensure that defendant participate in a sex-offender treatment program while incarcerated. State v. Cameron, 168 Vt. 421, 721 A.2d 493 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        A defendant has many opportunities to challenge his sentence and bring mitigating circumstances to the attention of the authorities: first, at his original sentencing hearing from which he may appeal; second, at a motion for reconsideration of sentence hearing available under this section within ninety days of the original sentencing; and third, at the probation revocation hearing, available under section 302 of Title 28, from which the defendant may also appeal.

        Denial of motion for reconsideration of sentence by trial court based on resolution of the district judges dated April 27, 1979, which mandated that a court, on reconsideration, only consider new evidence or extraordinary new circumstances not considered at the original sentencing and then unknown to the defendant, was erroneous, since the requirements of the resolution that reconsideration can only be based on "new evidence or extraordinary new circumstances" is not a limitation found in the language of this section and since the findings and conclusions of the court made it very plain that the operation of the resolution was taken as mandatory, even though it might have been intended to be advisory, and, therefore, the court failed to exercise discretion in a circumstance calling for its application.

         7. Purpose.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Where defendant grounded his motion on post-sentencing circumstances rather than some misapprehension by the court of the circumstances that existed when it sentenced him, nothing in the motion altered the court's judgment that a period of incarceration was appropriate given the circumstances; the court's order denying reconsideration of defendant's sentence was supported by the evidence and was consistent with the purpose of this section. State v. Sodaro, 178 Vt. 602, 878 A.2d 301 (mem.) (June 22, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Only circumstances and factors present at the time a sentence was originally imposed, not a defendant's conduct and behavior after sentencing, are relevant in a sentence reconsideration proceeding pursuant to 13 V.S.A.
        §
        7042. State v. Richardson, 161 Vt. 613, 640 A.2d 24 (mem.) (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is a proper use of this section to change a sentence imposed under a mistake about its legal effect on defendant's incarceration; this section is not, however, meant to supplant the parole process. State v. Martinsen, 156 Vt. 643, 590 A.2d 885 (mem.) (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of reconsideration under this section is to permit the trial judge to reconsider the sentencing decision absent the heat of trial pressures and in calm reflection. State v. LaPine, 148 Vt. 14, 527 A.2d 1150 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Implicit in this section is assumption that under consideration will be the circumstances and factors present at the time of the original sentencing, rather than defendant's conduct and behavior since sentencing. State v. LaPine, 148 Vt. 14, 527 A.2d 1150 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of sentence reconsideration is to allow a second look at the sentencing decision absent the heat of trial pressures and in calm reflection to determine that it is correct, fair, and serves the ends of justice. State v. Dean, 148 Vt. 510, 536 A.2d 909 (1987).

        The purpose of this section is to permit the trial judge to reconsider the sentencing decision absent the heat of trial pressures and in calm reflection to determine that it is correct, fair, and serves the ends of justice. State v. Allen, 145 Vt. 393, 488 A.2d 775 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Intent of subsec. (b) of this section contemplates that the state in setting forth its reasons for review will point to some error in the sentencing proceeding, or identify newly discovered evidence which by due diligence it could not have previously ascertained. State v. Rice, 145 Vt. 25, 483 A.2d 248 (1984).
       </p>

        In the case of defendant found guilty of two counts of simple assault, trial court properly denied defendant's motion for reduction of sentence, and the defendant failed to show any prejudice or impropriety in the sentencing procedure resulting from the inclusion in the presentence report of information that the defendant caused other disturbances on the day of the offenses, for which he was never charged, since the prohibited assertions of criminal activity were not considered by the trial court in determining the sentence, and further, the defendant did not object to the alleged objectionable material at any time prior to or during the sentencing hearing.

       <p>
        Based on the plain language of the sentence review statute and the sentence reduction rule, as reinforced by their purpose and effects, the Court's entry order dismissing the first appeal and leaving in place the conviction was an "order of the Supreme Court upholding a judgment of conviction." Defendant accordingly had 90 days after the order was entered to move for sentence reconsideration; as he had sought reconsideration within that period, his motion was timely. State v. Stearns, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (June 18, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plain meaning of the language "within 90 days after entry of any order or judgment of the Supreme Court upholding a judgment of conviction" in the sentence review statute encompasses an order dismissing an appeal that maintains a conviction in place. State v. Stearns, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (June 18, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court may reconsider a deferred sentence even though no sentence has actually been imposed. That remedy, however, has strict time limits; here, defendant did not seek modification of his deferred-sentence term within ninety days, and he could not do so now. State v. Love, 205 Vt. 222, 172 A.3d 777 (July 21, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant's sentence was imposed October 26, 1979, and, after serving nine months, he was placed on probation, which was revoked on February 24, 1981, after he was found in violation of probation, his motion for reconsideration of sentence filed on May 5, 1981, being filed more than six months after imposition of sentence, was untimely and properly dismissed by the trial court for lack of jurisdiction. State v. Therrien, 140 Vt. 625, 442 A.2d 1299 (1982).

        Judge did not abuse his discretion in ruling on defendant's motion for reconsideration of sentence without an evidentiary hearing where a lengthy and detailed hearing had been held prior to imposition of sentence, the sentence imposed fell well within the range of legal sentences and, in effect, the decision to hold no hearing meant that, even assuming the assertions in defendant's motion were true, the disposition of the motion would not change.

        Trial court acted without authority when, seven months after sentence was imposed, it revoked defendant's probation on three charges and continued his probation on a fourth charge, where effect was to alter defendant's sentence on one charge from concurrent to consecutive, to be served after he was released from incarceration on other three charges.

(b) of this section specifically granted the court authority to increase a sentence and the court did not abuse its discretion when it increased defendant's sentence after a hearing and presentence investigation report, the court had authority and jurisdiction to reconsider and revise defendant's sentence once he had begun serving it.

       </h5>
       <p>
        In a case where defendant embezzled from her employer, the employer's bank was a "victim" entitled to restitution; it was directly harmed since even though the money to pay the checks forged by defendant was initially drawn from the employer's bank account, defendant effectively stole from the bank and not the employer because of the bank's obligation to reimburse the employer for the money paid pursuant to the forged checks. State v. Stewart, 205 Vt. 472, 176 A.3d 1120 (Sept. 1, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Expenses for which restitution was being sought were not the direct result of the crime for which defendant was convicted and sentenced; instead, the expenses associated with extradition were directly related to the separate probation violation of leaving the state of Vermont without permission or notice to defendant's parole officer and taking up residence in the state of Washington. Thus, they could not be made the subject of a restitution order. State v. Bohannon, 187 Vt. 410, 996 A.2d 196 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        On its face, the restitution statute simply is not applicable to situations where no crime has occurred. It is universally acknowledged that a probation revocation proceeding is not essentially "criminal" in nature, and other courts have made a similar distinction between a probation violation and the underlying crime; it follows, therefore, that a probation violation is not a separate crime sufficient to independently trigger the restitution statute. State v. Bohannon, 187 Vt. 410, 996 A.2d 196 (2010).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Focus in awarding restitution to a victim is not the type of injury sustained, but rather the link between the damages and the crime; if readily ascertainable costs associated with emotional injury arising directly from a crime were not within the scope of restitution, restitution would not cover reasonable counseling expenses for victims of crime. That is an unduly narrow construction of the restitution statute. State v. Shepherd, 192 Vt. 494, 60 A.3d 213 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont law requires there to be a direct link between the loss for which restitution is ordered and the conduct for which defendant has been convicted. State v. LaFlam, 184 Vt. 629, 965 A.2d 519 (mem.) (2008).

        Amended restitution statute, 13 V.S.A.
        §
        7043, which was brought to the attention of debtor's counsel after a summary judgment order was issued, was not newly discovered evidence warranting reconsideration of the order under Fed. R. Bankr. P. 9024, which incorporates Fed. R. Civ. P. 60, because the statute, which addressed the discharge injunction, was in existence months before the filing of the revised motion for summary judgment and the debtor did not demonstrate that she would not have been aware of the statute through the exercise of due diligence. Pickett v. Quinn (In re Pickett), 321 B.R. 663 (Bankr. D. Vt. 2005).
       </p>

        Section 252(b)(6) of Title 28, which generally allows restitution as a condition of probation, is limited by this section, which specifically explains when restitution must be considered and what restitution may include. State v. Webb, 151 Vt. 200, 559 A.2d 658 (1989); State v. Jarvis, 146 Vt. 636, 509 A.2d 1005 (1986).

         4. Damages recoverable.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Under the statute, any restitution award must be limited to the material losses that the decedent incurred as a direct result of the defendant's crime; Vermont law requires there to be a direct link between the loss for which restitution is ordered and the conduct for which defendant has been convicted. Here, the only such loss included in the restitution orders, according to the State's description, was the decedent's $5,138 medical bill not covered by insurance. State v. Kenvin, 191 Vt. 30, 38 A.3d 26 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant, who pleaded guilty to aggravated assault, was convicted of a completed crime of which an "attempt" was an element with respect to the extent of the harm, and there was no dispute that defendant's actions caused physical injury to the victim. Thus, there was no merit to defendant's argument that his plea to attempting to cause serious bodily injury could not serve as a basis for restitution. State v. Thomas, 189 Vt. 106, 14 A.3d 961 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        When defendant and his friends drove three shopping carts into a river, there was no merit to defendant's argument that he could be required to pay restitution only for the shopping cart he personally drove. The statute did not preclude joint and several liability, and while defendant physically drove only one cart into the water, his actions, the terms of his indictment, and his admission to destroying the carts satisfied the requirement that damages be directly linked to the crime and supported the order holding him liable for the cost of replacing all three carts. State v. Hughes, 188 Vt. 595, 5 A.3d 926 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Owner of deer that have not been tagged or inventoried, in violation of the Captive Cervidae Rules, does not face forfeiture of the animals as a penalty. Thus, the fact that a deer owner had violated the Rules did not mean that defendant could not be ordered to pay him restitution for two missing deer. State v. Driscoll, 184 Vt. 381, 964 A.2d 1172 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no merit to defendant's argument that the State had not proven the existence of two deer for which defendant was required to pay restitution. The owner of the deer testified that the deer were present prior to the time defendant damaged his gate, and he relied upon a unique characteristic of these deer to identify them; the fact that the owner did not have a herd inventory and had not tagged the deer went to the weight of the evidence, which was the province of the trial court. State v. Driscoll, 184 Vt. 381, 964 A.2d 1172 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        To support an award of restitution, State must demonstrate both amount of victim's loss and causation between defendant's criminal act and victim's loss; an order of restitution must relate directly to the damage caused by defendant's criminal act for which he was convicted. State v. Forant, 168 Vt. 217, 719 A.2d 399 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Department of Corrections was the immediate and intended "victim" of defendant's criminal conduct (escape) for purposes of awarding restitution for extradition expenses. State v. Lewis, 167 Vt. 533, 711 A.2d 669 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        The expenses incurred for defendant's extradition were not consequential damages, nor did they comprise the ordinary operational costs of law enforcement, but were a direct consequence of his escape, and, therefore, constituted a "material loss" for which a quantifiable sum could be ascertained under the restitution statutory scheme. State v. Lewis, 167 Vt. 533, 711 A.2d 669 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly awarded restitution beyond the amount contained in the misdemeanor charge of which defendant was convicted. The Legislature did not intend to limit damages based on the dollar amount in the charge against a defendant, the restitution statute being based on the principle of compensation to the victim, rather than punishment of the defendant. Also, at sentencing, matters need be proven only by a preponderance of the evidence; thus, it was not inconsistent that the State could not prove the higher value in the criminal trial, but could do so during sentencing. State v. VanDusen, 166 Vt. 240, 691 A.2d 1053 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Only liquidated amounts which are easily ascertained and measured are recoverable as restitution under this section; these amounts include, but are not necessarily limited to, hospital bills, property value, and lost employment income. State v. Jarvis, 146 Vt. 636, 509 A.2d 1005 (1986).

        Vermont restitution statute is much narrower than restitution statutes in other jurisdictions and as such requires a direct link between the crime and the financial injury for which restitution is sought. The travel and storage expenses incurred by the decedent's family were not directly linked to the offense for which defendant was convicted, negligent operation of a motor vehicle; accordingly, there was no basis for the award of those expenses. State v. Kenvin, 191 Vt. 30, 38 A.3d 26 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Violation of the statute proscribing grossly negligent operation of a motor vehicle turns entirely on whether the driver's conduct involved a gross deviation from the care that a reasonable person would have exercised; the same conclusion follows, a fortiori, with respect to the lesser offense of negligent operation, which is defined strictly in terms of whether the defendant breached a duty to exercise ordinary care. Therefore, absent any element of injury or harm, defendant's conviction of negligent operation could not be causally linked to the decedent's death, and thus could not support a restitution award for any resulting financial loss. State v. Kenvin, 191 Vt. 30, 38 A.3d 26 (2011).

        It was an error to order defendant to pay restitution to a library. As the charge involving the library was dismissed under a plea agreement, the loss covered by the order was not caused by conduct for which defendant was convicted, and expenses incurred to change locks to prevent future crime could not be covered by a restitution order. State v. Baker, 189 Vt. 543, 12 A.3d 545 (2010).

        It was error to order defendant, who was convicted of driving with a suspended license, to pay restitution for damage to a store that he drove into. Vermont law required there to be a direct link between the loss for which restitution was ordered and the conduct for which a defendant had been convicted, and there was not such a link here.

        Vermont's restitution statute was narrowly drawn, and expenses incurred by wife in changing locks and telephone number at her home were not the direct result of defendant's crime of domestic assault, but were indirect costs resulting from wife's fear of her husband's access to house and concern that he would harass her using telephone, and these expenses were therefore not permissible subjects for restitution.

        Lost profits and opportunities may be awarded as restitution damages if the damages can be easily ascertained and measured and there is a reasonable basis for estimating the loss; however, when a printing business from which computer equipment had been stolen failed to supply any accounting data to demonstrate the basis for the estimate of the business's lost profits, could not show how many potential customers the business lost as a result of the theft, and had no idea of the value of the projects that might have been lost, the estimate of lost profits was based on speculation and conjecture and not on reasonable certainty, requiring a restitution award, except for the insurance deductible, to be stricken.

        In a restitution case, there was no plain error in measuring damages in calculating the amount of loss by using the cost of repair rather than the difference in the vehicle's fair market value before and after the accident. The statute did not prescribe a certain method for calculating damages, and defendant had not shown that a damage calculation based on the change in value would vary substantially from the repair cost.

        Deer were personal property; thus, their owner could testify to their value for purposes of restitution.

        There was no merit to defendant's argument that the State failed to meet its burden in proving that a store's losses of three shopping carts were uninsured.

        Defendant had not waived his right to challenge the legality of a restitution order by signing the plea agreement or by remaining silent at the plea hearing.

        There was no error in failing to allow defendant to withdraw his plea of guilty because the trial court did not reject the plea agreement.

        Because a hospital that treated the victim was not a direct victim of defendant's crime, the court struck the portion of the order granting it restitution.

        Legislature's use of the words "direct result" indicates that it intended to provide restitution only to direct victims of crime; the restitution statute has a narrow definition of "victim," and restitution may not include payments to insurers of direct victims. A medical provider is not a proper recipient of restitution because the provider's loss is consequential to, rather than a direct result of, the defendant's criminal conduct. State v.

       <p>
        Restitution order requiring defendant to reimburse the Victims Compensation Fund wholesale - without additional findings on the kinds of costs covered or their recipients - was improper because the court conflated an award from the Victims Compensation Board and an award of restitution pursuant to the restitution statute. Given the lack of findings, it was not evident that the compensation awarded by the Victims Compensation Board were for material losses suffered by the victim per the restitution statute. State v. Kenvin, 191 Vt. 30, 38 A.3d 26 (2011).

        Trial court did not err in authorizing a payment of $10,000 to the "Vermont Victim Compensation Program."

       </h5>
       <p>
        When the restitution statute authorizes the court to consider a defendant's "reasonably foreseeable ability to pay," this includes a defendant's reasonably foreseeable earning capacity. A defendant's reasonably foreseeable earning capacity includes the income the defendant could earn at the same rate of pay the defendant currently receives if she or he were working full time in the occupation in which she or he is already employed. State v. Dwight, 208 Vt. 29, 194 A.3d 1163 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in ordering a restitution payment schedule, as the restitution statute authorized the trial court to consider a defendant's reasonably foreseeable earning capacity, and the record supported the trial court's findings regarding defendant's current ability to pay and what he could pay if he worked full time at his current rate. State v. Dwight, 208 Vt. 29, 194 A.3d 1163 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        As the record was devoid of evidence to support a finding of current ability to pay the restitution judgment, and the State joined with defendant in arguing that the trial court erred on this point, the Court remanded the case to the trial court in order for it to determine defendant's ability to pay any restitution ordered. State v. Vezina, 199 Vt. 175, 121 A.3d 1195 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Ability-to-pay finding is not an essential finding to the determination of a victim's material loss. The statute enumerates material loss and ability to pay as distinct factors. State v. Vezina, 199 Vt. 175, 121 A.3d 1195 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even if more information were required for the trial court to make findings regarding defendant's ability to pay restitution, it was the State's burden to establish a defendant's ability to pay if the defendant did not offer evidence on his own behalf. On remand, the trial court had to make findings on defendant's ability to pay any restitution it ordered. State v. Kenvin, 191 Vt. 30, 38 A.3d 26 (2011).

       <p>
        Trial court properly ordered that defendant pay restitution for the relocation costs to Hawaii of the 10-year-old victim and his family. The requisite causal connection between the crime and the loss existed in that the victim's emotional injury and ostracization in a small town were the natural and probable consequences of the sexual assaults, thereby necessitating relocation; the secondary decision of where to relocate necessarily took into account the unique needs of the family as a whole, as the victim was a minor. State v. Shepherd, 192 Vt. 494, 60 A.3d 213 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Only liquidated amounts which are easily ascertained and measured are recoverable under the legislative scheme; these amounts include, but are not necessarily limited to, hospital bills, property value, and lost employment income. The inclusion of "uninsured out-of-pocket monetary loss" as a form of "material loss" indicates that the restitution statute is expansive enough to permit restitution of relocation costs, provided the trial court finds that there is a direct link between the crime and the costs incurred.

        In ordering restitution, the trial court did not err in awarding the full purchase price of drum equipment that had been returned. A boom stand and cymbal attachment were both only partially returned; as for cymbals, defendant's erasure of their logos had greatly diminished their value as collector's items, and they were returned dirty, nicked, and dented. State v. Vezina, 199 Vt. 175, 121 A.3d 1195 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        In awarding restitution for drum equipment, the trial court did not rely on the subjective value of the items to the owner, but considered the original purchase price of the items, the fact that the owner kept his equipment in mint condition, and the fact that the values at the time of the larceny of nearly all of the items at issue were likely higher than the original purchase price. These were all objective, market-based considerations. State v. Vezina, 199 Vt. 175, 121 A.3d 1195 (2015).

With such language present on the plea agreement that defendant signed, the fact that the trial court misspoke did not limit the restitution to the one-day charge description at the change-of-plea hearing.

        Civil settlement or release cannot entirely preclude a criminal restitution order because (1) the statutory obligation to impose restitution when necessary leaves no room for private parties to preclude a court from ordering it; (2) a release does not address the underlying purposes of restitution; and (3) the victim has no standing and is not a party in the restitution proceeding, and may seek a separate remedy in an action for civil damages.

       <p>
        Commissioner of Corrections' calculation for defendant's second sentence had not been issued when he filed his motion for sentence reconsideration in the trial court. The trial court, therefore, had not yet received all the facts necessary to make a determination about whether defendant should receive credit; thus, defendant's motion was premature, and the trial court acted within its discretion in deferring to the Department of Corrections. State v. Sommer, 190 Vt. 236, 27 A.3d 1059 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        There are several ways that a trial court can determine whether a defendant has received proper sentence credit for any days spent in custody in connection with the offense for which sentence was imposed. First, the sentencing court can decide that calculation of the time served involves a legal question that is best resolved by the court, and it can specify the extent of the credit, if any; second, the trial court can leave the sentence calculation to the Commissioner of Corrections, under which the normal remedy to challenge the Commissioner's conclusion would be an appeal to the Civil Division of the Superior Court; and third, the sentence can be reviewed to determine whether it is illegal because it fails to give defendant credit for days spent in custody in connection with the crime(s) for which defendant is sentenced. State v. Sommer, 190 Vt. 236, 27 A.3d 1059 (2011).

     <p>
      In pronouncing sentence of death upon a person who is convicted of a capital crime, the court shall appoint a week within which the sentence shall be executed.
    At the time of such sentence, the court shall order a warrant to be issued by the clerk, under the seal of the court for the county in which such sentence is passed, to be directed to the Commissioner of Corrections, stating the conviction and sentence and commanding him or her to cause execution to be done in accordance with the provisions of such sentence, upon a day within the week so appointed.
    At the same time, the clerk shall transmit to the sheriff of the county in which such sentence is passed a mittimus directing him or her to deliver the body of such person to the Commissioner of Corrections and deliver to him or her a true and attested copy of such mittimus, the original of which shall be returned by the sheriff to the court from which issued. Unless a reprieve is granted or the inmate is pardoned, the sentence of death shall be executed by the Commissioner of Corrections, or by a person acting under his or her direction, within the week appointed by the court.
    If a reprieve is granted, the sentence of death shall be executed within the week beginning on the day next after the day on which the term of respite expires, and such sentence shall be executed on such day within such week as the Commissioner elects.
    Previous announcement thereof shall not be made, except to such persons as are to be present.

      A prisoner who is in custody under sentence of a court and claims the right to be released upon the ground that the sentence was imposed in violation of the constitution or laws of the United States, or of the State of Vermont, or that the court was without jurisdiction to impose the sentence, or that the sentence was in excess of the maximum authorized by law, or is otherwise subject to collateral attack, may at any time move the Superior Court of the county where the sentence was imposed to vacate, set aside or correct the sentence. However, the Superior or District judge who presided when the original sentence was imposed shall not hear the application.

        This section is patterned after the federal post-conviction relief statute, 28 U.S.C.
        §
        2255 (1976). In re Stewart, 140 Vt. 351, 438 A.2d 1106 (1981).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Since V.R.Cr.P. 32(d) was a rule of criminal procedure, not a remedial statute, it did not merit a liberal construction which would permit a defendant to withdraw his guilty plea even when he could seek relief under post-conviction relief statute. State v. Wargo, 168 Vt. 231, 719 A.2d 407 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where habeas corpus formerly protected against only "jurisdictional" defects in criminal judgments under state law, relief is available, under this section for a variety of errors that affect the validity of guilty verdicts. In re Stewart, 140 Vt. 351, 438 A.2d 1106 (1981).

        </b>
       </h5>

        The purpose of post-conviction relief under the statute is to provide prisoners with an opportunity to challenge the legality of their confinement, and thus to guard against illegal restraints on liberty. In re Laws, 182 Vt. 66, 928 A.2d 1210 (June 22, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        One fundamental aspect of post-conviction relief (PCR) is that a challenge to confinement may be brought "at any time." Nonetheless, in other respects, PCR is a limited remedy. Post-conviction-relief proceedings are not a vehicle for addressing the petitioner's guilt or innocence, nor are they a substitute for direct appeal of a conviction or sentence. Rather, claims for PCR are limited to collateral attacks on the petitioner's conviction. In re Laws, 182 Vt. 66, 928 A.2d 1210 (June 22, 2007).

        The primary mechanism for post-conviction relief in Vermont is this section, which is a special statutory remedy in the nature of habeas corpus. In re Stewart, 140 Vt. 351, 438 A.2d 1106 (1981).

       <p>
        A post-conviction relief (PCR) petitioner may raise ineffective assistance of counsel, a constitutional challenge to the statute under which the petitioner was convicted or sentenced, or the adequacy of a Rule 11 plea colloquy. In forwarding such arguments, the petitioner has the substantial burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence that fundamental errors rendered his conviction defective. In re Laws, 182 Vt. 66, 928 A.2d 1210 (June 22, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        On a petition for post-conviction relief, the petitioner has the substantial burden of proving by a preponderance of the evidence, that fundamental errors rendered his conviction defective. In re Grega, 175 Vt. 631, 833 A.2d 872 (mem.) (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even a professionally unreasonable error by counsel does not guarantee success on a claim alleging ineffective assistance of counsel because the petitioner must demonstrate prejudice. In re Grega, 175 Vt. 631, 833 A.2d 872 (mem.) (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the issues raised in a petition for post-conviction relief were contested at trial and were not raised on direct appeal, they will not be addressed on post-conviction review unless it is demonstrated that the failure to raise them on direct appeal was inadvertent, that appellate counsel was ineffective, or that extraordinary circumstances excused the failure to raise the issues on appeal. In re Carter, 176 Vt. 322, 848 A.2d 281 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where none of the issues presented in petitioner's post-conviction relief petition were raised or adjudicated in the district court, deliberate bypass did not apply. In re Carter, 176 Vt. 322, 848 A.2d 281 (2004).
       </p>

        The standards and burdens of proof to be applied under the Vermont Fair Employment Practices Act are identical to those applied under Title VII of the United States Civil Rights Act of 1964. Robertson v. Mylan Labs., Inc., 176 Vt. 356, 848 A.2d 310 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        To be eligible for post-conviction relief, petitioner bears burden of demonstrating that he did not deliberately bypass issues which could have been raised on direct appeal. In re Hart, 167 Vt. 630, 715 A.2d 640 (mem.) (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to obtain post-conviction relief, petitioner is required to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, that fundamental errors rendered his conviction defective. State v. Bristol, 159 Vt. 334, 618 A.2d 1290 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        When fundamental error claimed in petition for post-conviction relief is ineffective assistance of counsel, petitioner must first show that counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness informed by prevailing professional norms; having met that burden, petitioner must then show reasonable probability that, but for counsel's unprofessional errors, result of proceeding would have been different. State v. Bristol, 159 Vt. 334, 618 A.2d 1290 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        The burden of proving alleged error and prejudice resulting therefrom is on petitioner for post-conviction relief. In re Kivela, 145 Vt. 454, 494 A.2d 126 (1985).

       </p>
       <p>
        In a post-conviction proceeding, the burden of proving the alleged violation or defects rests on petitioner. In re Bentley, 144 Vt. 404, 477 A.2d 980 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner who sought post-conviction relief claiming that he was denied effective assistance of counsel at trial had to establish by a preponderance of the evidence that ineffective counsel caused fundamental errors in his trial. In re Angelucci, 143 Vt. 187, 463 A.2d 218 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        The burden of proving that a procedural shortcoming has hampered or frustrated the exercise of an accused's rights rests squarely on the petitioner in a post-conviction proceeding. In re Hall, 143 Vt. 590, 469 A.2d 756 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where no expert evidence was adduced at trial concerning actual or likely effect of medication upon petitioner for post-conviction relief and his ability to make a knowing, voluntary and intelligent decision to plead guilty, and petition rested on bare assertion that the plea was not voluntary due to the medication, trial court's findings and conclusions were clearly supported by the record, petitioner having failed to meet his burden of establishing his allegation. In re Battick, 137 Vt. 408, 406 A.2d 381 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        The allocation of the burden of proof between the applicant for post conviction relief and the state is governed by the usual principles of law according to the nature of the claim advanced, thus the burden rests with the party who advances the factual contention asserted in the application or the answer, as the case may be. In re Mossey, 129 Vt. 133, 274 A.2d 473 (1971).
       </p>

        Where no affirmative defenses were involved in post conviction relief proceedings, the petitioner, as the advancing party, had the burden of establishing the facts alleged in his petition. In re Mossey, 129 Vt. 133, 274 A.2d 473 (1971).
       </p>

         10. Ineffective assistance of counsel.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Summary judgment to the State with respect to an inmate's claim of ineffective assistance of counsel was error in the inmate's post-conviction relief petition, as there were conflicts in the record regarding whether counsel reasonably anticipated the consequences of suggesting a risky defense strategy, whether he sufficiently informed the inmate about the risks and, if he did not, whether the inmate's defense was prejudiced thereby In re Lowry, 195 Vt. 14, 84 A.3d 816 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        When petitioner is seeking post-conviction relief based on a claim of ineffective assistance of counsel he must demonstrate first that counsel's performance fell below an objective standard of reasonableness informed by prevailing professional norms and second, that counsel's deficient performance prejudiced the defense. In re Washington, 176 Vt. 529, 838 A.2d 87 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a post-conviction relief hearing, the court erred by permitting the judge who presided over defendant's original trial to testify as the State's expert witness, to testify that the jury would probably not have reached a different result had defense counsel's performance met the prevailing standard of competency.
    Although the judge's role at the original trial did give him the benefit of first-hand knowledge, because of that role, and his obligations as presiding judge, he could not testify as a neutral and impartial observer of the trial.
    Also, because he gave persuasive testimony on a critical and contested issue, it could not be concluded that allowing his testimony was harmless error. In re Wilkinson, 165 Vt. 183, 678 A.2d 1257 (1996).

       <p>
        A post-conviction relief (PCR) petitioner may not raise an issue that was litigated in the criminal trial but deliberately bypassed on direct appeal. In re Laws, 182 Vt. 66, 928 A.2d 1210 (June 22, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the context of a post-conviction relief proceeding, the superior court may make an independent evaluation on the ultimate issue of voluntariness. In re Robinson, 161 Vt. 550, 641 A.2d 779 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Post-conviction relief proceedings do not address the guilt or innocence of the defendant, but the fairness of the proceedings leading to conviction and incarceration. In re Bentley, 144 Vt. 404, 477 A.2d 980 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court's task on a post-conviction motion for relief based upon failure of counsel to perfect an appeal is merely to decide whether an appeal would have been patently frivolous, and if the petitioner had a prayer of a chance of success, relief should be granted. In re Savo, 139 Vt. 527, 431 A.2d 482 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court is not required to consider the merits of a petitioner's claim to be addressed on appeal in order to determine whether the failure of counsel to perfect appeal is of prejudicial dimension; the trial court's task is limited to applying the "prayer of a chance of success" standard to a petitioner's claims. In re Rebideau, 139 Vt. 530, 431 A.2d 484 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Not only may post-conviction relief take a wide range, including remedies short of full release, but the scope of review is likewise broad, and it included claim that imposition of sentence following alleged breach of probation was unsupportable because the probation could not properly have been continued to the time of the alleged breach of probation. Sherwin v. Hogan, 136 Vt. 606, 401 A.2d 895 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Issue of alleged lack of treatment while appellant was confined as a psychopathic personality was not properly before supreme court under vehicle of post-conviction relief. In re Trivento, 131 Vt. 610, 312 A.2d 910 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        The scope of review in post-conviction relief proceedings is broad, and its concerns include the exercise of discretionary powers by the courts. In re Provencher, 127 Vt. 558, 255 A.2d 180 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        A petitioner for post-conviction relief who plead guilty ought not to have more complete review of those lesser shortcomings of the proceeding which did not substantively wrong him than he would have had after a complete trial. In re Provencher, 127 Vt. 558, 255 A.2d 180 (1969).

       </h5>
       <p>
        While it is true that this section requires that defendant seek relief in "the superior court of the county where the sentence was imposed," this provision goes to venue and not subject matter jurisdiction. Accordingly, while a party may seek to transfer venue under the authority of the statute, the superior court erred in concluding that it was without jurisdiction to hear defendant's petition. In re Laws, 182 Vt. 66, 928 A.2d 1210 (June 22, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        By statute, judges who preside over a criminal trial and sentencing are precluded from hearing an application for post-conviction relief in the same case. In re Barrows, 181 Vt. 283, 917 A.2d 490.
       </p>
       <p>
        Not every collateral consequence associated with a conviction will trigger post-conviction review jurisdiction, and a conviction may deny or impinge on privileges that are so trivial that jurisdiction will not be found. In re Smith, 144 Vt. 494, 479 A.2d 152 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where petitioner, who had completed his sentence on a kidnapping conviction, failed to allege or demonstrate any collateral consequences stemming from that sentence, he failed to invoke post-conviction relief jurisdiction. In re Smith, 144 Vt. 494, 479 A.2d 152 (1984).

        This section permits a collateral attack upon Vermont convictions or sentences which are defective under the constitution, statutory law, or otherwise subject to collateral attack. In re Stewart, 140 Vt. 351, 438 A.2d 1106 (1981).

Trivento v. Commissioner of Corrections, 135 Vt. 475, 380 A.2d 69 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petition for writ of habeas corpus brought by prisoner seeking release from confinement under sentence imposed upon conviction of violation of probation fell within ambit of post-conviction relief statutes and jurisdiction in the first instance was in a superior judge or county court, not the supreme court, in which relief could be had only by right of appeal.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Petitioner, who was being held without bail pending trial, had failed to demonstrate that his current incarceration was sufficiently related to the prior convictions he sought to attack in his application for postconviction relief; thus, he had not met the "in custody under sentence" requirement of the postconviction relief statute. The prior convictions played a minimal, if any, role in the trial court's decision to hold petitioner without bail. In re Russo, 193 Vt. 594, 72 A.3d 900 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        A defendant seeking to challenge an expired prior DUI conviction that was used to enhance a sentence satisfies the "in custody under sentence" requirement of this section. State v. Boskind, 174 Vt. 184, 807 A.2d 358 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because petitioner was under no supervision by judicial officers and was not subject to incarceration without a trial and conviction, permanent revocation of his driver's license for driving while intoxicated did not constitute his being "in custody" for purposes of post-conviction relief statute, and therefore superior court lacked jurisdiction to hear his petition. In re LaMountain, 170 Vt. 642, 752 A.2d 24 (mem.) (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner seeking post-conviction relief under an allegedly invalid sentence must be "in custody" or court will lack jurisdiction to consider the motion; petitioner need not actually be incarcerated to meet the "custody" requirement, but his conduct must be to some degree under the supervision of judicial officers or petitioner may face the possibility of imminent incarceration without a formal trial and criminal conviction. In re Liberty, 154 Vt. 643, 572 A.2d 1381 (mem.) (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        A person who is not incarcerated is nevertheless in custody for purposes of this section if he or she suffers a significant restraint on personal liberty as a direct result of the challenged conviction. In re Smith, 144 Vt. 494, 479 A.2d 152 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        The jurisdictional limitation on this section is that the petitioner must be "in custody" to mount a collateral attack upon Vermont convictions or sentences. In re Stewart, 140 Vt. 351, 438 A.2d 1106 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section, which permits collateral attack upon Vermont convictions or sentences, requires that an individual be "in custody under sentence of a court," but does not mention "custody in Vermont"; thus, the specific language of the statute does not shed light on the jurisdictional requirements of "in custody." In re Stewart, 140 Vt. 351, 438 A.2d 1106 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        An individual need not be incarcerated to satisfy the "in custody" requirement of this section; post-conviction petitions require consideration even where relief from confinement is not one of the possible dispositions under the issues presented. In re Stewart, 140 Vt. 351, 438 A.2d 1106 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        A person is "in custody" for the purposes of this section if he suffers a significant restraint on personal liberty as a direct result of the challenged Vermont conviction, without regard to his geographic location. In re Stewart, 140 Vt. 351, 438 A.2d 1106 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Every collateral consequence associated with a conviction will not trigger jurisdiction under this section, and a conviction may deny some privileges so trivial that the "in custody" requirement of the statute is not satisfied. In re Stewart, 140 Vt. 351, 438 A.2d 1106 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where petitioner had received an aggravated sentence, without the possibility of probation, as a direct result of his Vermont convictions, he was "in custody" for the purposes of this section since such a sentence strikes at the liberty interests that the statute was designed to protect.

        Defendant's challenge to a 1993 conviction being used to enhance his current sentence, a challenge which concerned the adequacy of the 1993 plea colloquy, could be addressed in a postconviction relief petition. Thus, the common law remedy of coram nobis was not available to defendant. State v. Sinclair, 191 Vt. 489, 49 A.3d 152 (2012).

        If defendants choose to challenge the district courts' compliance with V.R.Cr.P. 11, the rule governing the procedure employed in taking defendants' prior pleas, they must do so in superior court pursuant to this section. State v. Boskind, 174 Vt. 184, 807 A.2d 358 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where petition for post-conviction relief sought to have conditions of probation which had been imposed pursuant to a plea agreement vacated, the petition would be treated as a request to have petitioner's sentence vacated and the case remanded for sentence reconsideration, since petitioner had received the benefit of his bargain by serving only twenty weekend in jail for the crime of first-degree arson, and, therefore, vacating the probation conditions that represented his primary obligation under the agreement would be unjustifiable. In re Fadden, 148 Vt. 116, 530 A.2d 560 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Special remedy provided by this subchapter in nature of habeas corpus applicable to those in custody under sentence of court was the only remedy available to defendant who filed motion, while in execution of sentence, by which he sought to withdraw his plea of guilty made to the offenses charged against him. State v. Cooley, 135 Vt. 409, 377 A.2d 1386 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Persons who have been committed under law relating to mentally defective delinquents are in custody within the contemplation of this section, therefore, a petition under this section may have to precede any application for habeas corpus, and where such person seeks relief by habeas corpus first, it may be treated as a petition for review and as such a copy of the order of confinement need not accompany the petition. Trivento v. Smith, 129 Vt. 346, 278 A.2d 722 (1971), overruled on other grounds, Trivento v. Commissioner of Corrections, 135 Vt. 475, 380 A.2d 69 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a guilty plea has been unfairly induced through ignorance, fear or misunderstanding, the appropriate remedy is to make timely application to vacate the plea and be permitted to stand trial. In re Dussault, 128 Vt. 135, 259 A.2d 776 (1969).

        Where the authenticated record of the prior proceedings was competent evidence of the facts and occurrences which took place at that time, including the solemn admissions made by the petitioner in the district court, and the verity of that record was not impeached by petitioner's evidence presented at the hearing for post conviction relief, it was for the trial court to determine the weight and credibility of the petitioner's testimony.

        A court does not have the power to modify a sentence after the term of court has expired and execution of sentence has begun, unless the sentence was somehow invalid or improperly imposed. In re Shequin, 131 Vt. 111, 300 A.2d 536 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        The post-conviction relief statutes are not intended as general sentence review statutes, they do not permit a successful attack on a valid sentence and where error in the sentence initially imposed was not shown, the court was without authority to change it. In re Shequin, 131 Vt. 111, 300 A.2d 536 (1973).

        Findings in post-conviction relief decision will not be disturbed if they are supported by any credible evidence, and even when evidence is conflicting, supreme court will defer to trial court's judgment. State v. Bristol, 159 Vt. 334, 618 A.2d 1290 (1992).

        Where court denying post-conviction relief made findings and conclusions which were not explicit on all material issues, and found "insufficient evidence adduced to sustain any of defendant's complaints," without including findings of those facts which would sustain such a statement, reversal and remand were required.

        The doctrine of laches does not apply to actions under this section. In re Stewart, 140 Vt. 351, 438 A.2d 1106 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        The state has a significant interest in the finality of criminal judgments and delay in requesting post-conviction relief impairs a court's ability to judge the validity of the attacked conviction, as witnesses and records may be unavailable; however, a petitioner's tardiness penalizes him more severely inasmuch as delay does not alter the burden upon the movant to establish the infirmity of the conviction by a preponderance of the evidence, post-conviction relief is not a vehicle for reexamining guilt or innocence, but is designed to correct fundamental errors, and post-conviction relief is not a substitute for appeal and, absent exigent circumstances, a matter adversely decided on direct appeal cannot be relitigated, and collateral attack is barred if the movant deliberately bypassed the issue on appeal, and those safeguards, which adequately protect the state's interest in finality, render the application of the doctrine of laches to actions under this section.

        .
       </h5>
       <p>
        Postconviction relief (PCR) petition which was based on an adjudication of delinquency was not moot based on the fact that petitioner was now over 18 and no longer in State custody, as whether a petitioner was in custody under sentence was determined when the PCR complaint was filed and not at a later date when custody might have ceased, and there were significant collateral consequences associated with a delinquency adjudication. In re D.C., 202 Vt. 340, 149 A.3d 466 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Supreme Court of Vermont holds that when a petitioner initiates a proceeding attacking the validity of a conviction for which he is still in custody, his release from custody will not moot the petition. In re Chandler, 193 Vt. 246, 67 A.3d 261 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner inmate's post-conviction claim of ineffective assistance of counsel which was filed before the expiration of his sentence for the challenged conviction was not rendered moot by the inmate's release from custody prior to a determination on the merits. In re Chandler, 193 Vt. 246, 67 A.3d 261 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Petitioner probationer's license suspension was not a sentence and did not serve to keep his postconviction relief petition alive after his sentence expired. Suspension was a civil, not a criminal, sanction; regardless of the merits of the petition, petitioner would remain twice convicted of driving under the influence, and the length of his license suspension was beyond the reach of postconviction relief. In re Collette, 185 Vt. 210, 969 A.2d 101 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not the case that petitioners who choose for whatever reason to ignore more timely procedures and defer the filing of a postconviction relief petition until after an enhanced sentencing proceeding will invariably find the claim mooted by completion of their sentence. Had petitioner probationer, whose sentence expired after he filed his petition, filed a more timely amended petition or a motion to expedite, there was no evident reason why the petition could not have been heard and resolved before his discharge from probation. In re Collette, 185 Vt. 210, 969 A.2d 101 (2008).

        Anders-type explanation justifying counsel's withdrawal is not required in the postconviction relief context. The withdrawal prerequisites called for in Anders are designed to vindicate a defendant's constitutional right to counsel, and, as the United States Supreme Court has recognized, a petitioner has no constitutional right to counsel in civil postconviction relief proceedings; absent an underlying constitutional right to counsel in state postconviction proceedings, there is no constitutional right to insist on the Anders procedures which were designed solely to protect that underlying constitutional right.

        Civil trial court that granted petitioner inmate postconviction relief had the statutory authority to remand the case to the criminal court for further proceedings, as the grant of relief returned the case to its pre-plea status and necessitated a determination of the inmate's guilt or innocence.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court at post-conviction relief hearing properly entertained failure to object issue, despite its having been heard on direct appeal of conviction, since court did not definitively pass on whether failure to object was plain error, and failure was one of petitioner's many grounds for relief. In re Ringler, 158 Vt. 118, 605 A.2d 522 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        The scope of review in post-conviction relief proceedings is broad, and its concerns include the exercise of discretionary powers by the courts. In re Provencher, 127 Vt. 558, 255 A.2d 180 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        A petitioner for post-conviction relief who plead guilty ought not to have a more complete review of those lesser shortcomings of the proceeding which did not substantively wrong him than he would have had after a complete trial. In re Provencher, 127 Vt. 558, 255 A.2d 180 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        The court would review the lawfulness of the confinement of post-conviction relief petitioner who plead guilty and did not, by pretrial motion, preserve for review claimed defects appropriately raised by such motion, in light of unfamiliarity of the requirements set by instant case with respect to the preservation, by one who pleads guilty, of claimed defects appropriately raised by pretrial motion and in light of broad scope of review in post-conviction relief proceedings and the attendant discretionary powers.

        Trial court failed to make the necessary findings with respect to petitioner inmate's ineffectiveness claim regarding counsel's failure to seek a stipulation that the inmate was insane at the time of his offense, such that the matter was not properly reviewable. In re Combs, 190 Vt. 559, 27 A.3d 318 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although supreme court will defer to findings made in post-conviction relief hearings where evidence is conflicting, conflict in findings themselves is grounds for reversal. In re Moulton, 158 Vt. 580, 613 A.2d 705 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court's findings at post-conviction proceedings will stand on appeal unless clearly erroneous or not supported by any credible evidence. In re Moulton, 158 Vt. 580, 613 A.2d 705 (1992).

        Findings at post-conviction proceedings which do no more than recite substance of certain testimony given by one party or the other are immaterial and not for consideration on appeal. In re Moulton, 158 Vt. 580, 613 A.2d 705 (1992).

       <p>
        Where court at post-conviction relief hearing made conflicting findings as to whether petitioner reasonably relied on a material misunderstanding regarding parole eligibility when he entered his nolo contendere plea, order granting relief was reversed and remanded; on remand, court was directed to correct its findings to eliminate conflict and issue new conclusion on corrected findings; if it concluded that petitioner entered his plea in reasonable reliance upon a material misunderstanding resulting from misinformation provided by his attorneys, it must determine whether such misunderstanding worked to petitioner's prejudice, and, if necessary, conduct new proceedings to so determine. In re Moulton, 158 Vt. 580, 613 A.2d 705 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Purpose of findings required by this section is to make clear to the parties and to the supreme court what was decided and how the decision was reached; findings should be explicit on all material issues and essential facts and facts relevant to the controversy should be found, although recitals of all the evidence and claims of the parties need not be included and every item of testimony need not be processed. In re Fuller, 135 Vt. 575, 381 A.2d 1056 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Requests for findings, not granted, are considered to have been refused, and, if error, the question is preserved for appellate review. In re Fuller, 135 Vt. 575, 381 A.2d 1056 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where appellant sought a holding that the reviewing court should have added to its findings, as he timely requested, a further finding that his assigned attorney discussed with him, prior to his guilty plea, the attorney's possible withdrawal and the necessity for appellant's parents to mortgage their home to retain another attorney, it did not necessarily follow that a remand for finding on the issue was required, as the trial court was presented with a timely motion to amend its findings in this respect and refused to do so, such refusal plainly expressing the rejection of the affirmative issue as not proven, and leaving no doubt that the trial court considered the issue. In re Fuller, 135 Vt. 575, 381 A.2d 1056 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where, upon affirmance of conviction, a new mittimus was issued as a matter of law, service of the prior mittimus having been stayed, this was merely the issuance of a mittimus after disposition on appeal, not a sentencing procedure, and petition for post-conviction relief alleging prisoner was either never sentenced or sentenced in absentia was properly denied.

       <p>
        It is clear that this section bars relitigation of claims actually raised and decided on the merits in an earlier post-conviction relief (PCR) action. What is less clear, however, is the extent to which the statute bars a second PCR based on different grounds, and whether it matters that the petitioner could have raised those grounds in the earlier PCR, but failed to do so. In re Laws, 182 Vt. 66, 928 A.2d 1210 (June 22, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        The following test for abuse of the writ of habeas corpus is adopted as the proper test for successive PCR (post-conviction relief) motions: When a petitioner files a second or subsequent petition, the government bears the burden of pleading abuse of the writ. The government satisfies this burden if, with clarity and particularity, it notes petitioner's prior writ history, identifies the claims that appear for the first time, and alleges that petitioner has abused the writ. The burden to disprove abuse then becomes petitioner's. The petitioner's opportunity to meet the burden of cause and prejudice will not include an evidentiary hearing if the district court determines as a matter of law that petitioner cannot satisfy the standard. In re Laws, 182 Vt. 66, 928 A.2d 1210 (June 22, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Insofar as a petition for post conviction relief seeks to reopen questions as to ignorance and misunderstanding of defendant in changing his plea from not guilty to guilty, it was repetitive in that such questions had been clearly presented and litigated in previous habeas corpus proceedings, and therefore dismissal of such aspect of the post conviction relief petition without further exploration of the matter was justified under provisions of this section.

Coyle v. Hofmann, 186 Vt. 525, 974 A.2d 616 (mem.) (2009).

        While a legislature may regulate the procedure with respect to habeas corpus and, to some extent, the purposes for which it is used, the right to the writ may not be abrogated or the writ's efficiency curtailed. Shequin v. Smith, 129 Vt. 578, 285 A.2d 708 (1971).

        Minor prisoner's challenge to his mother's mental competency to represent him at trial as guardian ad litem and enter guilty plea to second degree murder was a collateral attack on prisoner's sentence, and remedy was post-conviction relief under this subchapter, which provided an adequate and effective test of legality of detention, and prisoner was not entitled to habeas corpus where he had not sought post-conviction relief. Shequin v. Smith, 129 Vt. 578, 285 A.2d 708 (1971).

        Where prisoner who sought release under general habeas corpus statute should have proceeded under this subchapter, and all substantive requirements of this subchapter had been met, court would treat petition as properly brought, in interests of justice and consistent with the remedial intent of this subchapter. Sherwin v. Hogan, 136 Vt. 606, 401 A.2d 895 (1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Before seeking habeas corpus, which lies in the county of imprisonment, one under a conviction must bring a petition for postconviction relief before the court in which conviction was had, and before a judge other than the sentencing judge; but where, prior to a petition for post-conviction relief, prisoner brought habeas corpus petition, court would, in interests of justice and since the requisites for one existed, treat it as petition for post-conviction relief. Berard v. Moeykens, 132 Vt. 597, 326 A.2d 166 (1974).

      The court may appoint counsel if the prisoner is unable financially to employ counsel, and may order that all necessary costs and expenses incident to the matter, including court costs, stenographic services, printing, and reasonable compensation for legal services, be paid by the State from the appropriation to the court where the sentence was imposed.
    On appeal, the Supreme Court may make a similar order.

        The expenses incurred by the Department of Corrections for the extradition of defendant, who pled guilty to escape, did not constitute nontaxable costs of prosecution, as defendant had purposely attempted to evade the law, resulting in pecuniary damages suffered by the State.

        In this case, which was a petition for a new trial based on ground of newly discovered evidence of respondent's insanity, court, resolving any doubts in his favor, and applying principles of law applicable, was unable to reach any other conclusion upon whole case than that result of a new trial would be same as was that of former, and petition was therefore dismissed.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Provision of this section relating to stay of execution was intended to guarantee one appealing a conviction that he will not have to serve his sentence until the time for entering an appeal has expired or the appeal has been heard. State v. Bruley, 129 Vt. 124, 274 A.2d 467 (1970).

         2. Motion to trial court.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Under this section, exceptions by a respondent could be allowed and placed upon record only on his motion made in trial court, and until they were so allowed and on record cause could not pass to this court, and so, where respondent's original bill of exceptions was not filed until after final adjournment of term of county court at which trial was had, case was not in supreme court and bill of exceptions was dismissed. State v. Webb, 89 Vt. 326, 95 A. 892 (1915), same case (1916) 90 Vt. 65, 96 A. 599.
       </p>
       <p>
        Where respondent, before adjournment of term of county court where he was convicted, filed a skeleton bill of his exceptions, duly signed and "allowed subject to amendment," and reciting his exceptions only in general terms, an amended bill of exceptions, filed in vacation and more fully setting forth the exceptions referred to in the skeleton bill and also reciting exceptions not so referred to, was sufficiently in accord with the requirement of this section and brought up for review as part of record all exceptions therein recited, where transcript was not made controlling. State v. Gomez, 89 Vt. 490, 96 A. 190 (1915).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        A motion in arrest of judgment could not be filed in supreme court in a criminal cause. State v. O'Neil, 66 Vt. 356, 29 A. 376 (1894), same case (1885) 58 Vt. 140, 2 A. 586.
       </p>
       <p>
        Motion in arrest could properly be filed in supreme court in first instance, but should be filed in trial court and pass upon exceptions to supreme court, but in the present case, inasmuch as court might remand cause to county court for purpose of allowing motion to be filed there, and in consideration of the far-reaching effect of motion, a motion in arrest was allowed. State v. Hodgson, 66 Vt. 134, 28 A. 1089 (1893), aff'd 168 U.S. 262, 18 S. Ct. 80, 42 L. Ed. 461 (1897).

       <p>
        The discretionary power of allowing bail in criminal appeals, within the provisions of
        §
        7556 of this title, is confined to the judge or judges of the court where the appellant was convicted; no such power is conferred on the supreme court under that section's provisions. State v. Miner, 127 Vt. 104, 241 A.2d 64 (1968).

       </h5>
       <p>
        It is a general rule that an appeal should not be permitted in criminal causes until a final verdict, adverse to defendant has been rendered, but under 12 V.S.A.
        §
        2386, courts have discretion to permit an appeal before judgment for the determination of questions of law. State v. Blondin, 128 Vt. 613, 270 A.2d 165 (1970).

         8. Restrictions of right of appeal.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Vermont Supreme Court is wary of adopting per se rules in criminal cases, and generally considers doing so only to remedy obvious abuses. It declined defendant's invitation to adopt a per se rule that allowing any judge, under any circumstance, to impose a higher sentence following a defendant's conviction after a successful appeal always impermissibly burdened a defendant's absolute statutory right of appeal. State v. Hazelton, 186 Vt. 342, 987 A.2d 915 (Aug. 21, 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right of appeal from a criminal conviction is conferred absolutely by this section, and its restriction or prohibition as a condition of sentence deferment or probation cannot be reconciled with the section; court will not condone or enforce an agreement whereby, in exchange for probation or a deferred sentence, one has placed upon him restrictions upon the issues he may raise on appeal. State v. Buck, 139 Vt. 310, 428 A.2d 1090 (1981).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court has discretion in the matter of staying execution pending appeal and supreme court will not interject itself into its exercise without a demonstration of abuse. State v. Oakes, 129 Vt. 241, 276 A.2d 18, cert. denied, 404 U.S. 965, 92 S. Ct. 340, 30 L. Ed. 2d 285 (1971).

       <p>
        Since a transcript is to be furnished at state expense to an indigent, and if required for appellate purposes, must be furnished as a matter of right under the United States Constitution, the judicial branch is compelled to request, and the legislative branch to provide, as a matter of constitutional duty, the reportorial staff necessary to carry out this mandate.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Denial of a motion made under rule to withdraw a plea is a question of law involved in a judgment of conviction and therefore an appealable order under this section; as such it must be designated in any notice of appeal as the order appealed from. State v. Wisell, 136 Vt. 541, 394 A.2d 1144 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        As to April 14 judgment entered on plea of nolo contendere, notice of appeal filed August 9 was out of time, more than 30 days having passed, and the judgment could not be considered on appeal; but appeal was timely as to August 4 order denying April 28 motion to withdraw the plea, and denial of motion to withdraw would be considered, appeal from it being within 30 day limit.

       </h5>
       <p>
        This section provides the sole legal authority for criminal appeals by the prosecution to the supreme court under V.R.A.P. 4. State v. Saari, 152 Vt. 510, 568 A.2d 344 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the resolution of the issue on appeal may be dictated by facts that are developed at trial, interlocutory review is improper; in such a case, the question is neither controlling nor will it materially advance the termination of the litigation. State v. Dubois, 150 Vt. 600, 556 A.2d 86 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jurisdiction of supreme court to hear interlocutory appeals is limited in criminal matters to a prosecution by complaint, information or indictment. State v. Springer, 139 Vt. 471, 431 A.2d 460 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        The jurisdiction of the supreme court to hear and determine exceptions reserved by the state is restricted to appeals expressly authorized by appellate procedures. State v. Benjamin, 124 Vt. 20, 196 A.2d 507 (1963).

         2. Constitutionality.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Constitution of Vermont contained no provision against double jeopardy, and statute giving state right of exception in criminal case equal in all respects to that possessed by respondent was not infringement of due process of law. State v. Deso, 110 Vt. 1, 1 A.2d 710 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section was not in violation of our bill of rights, art. 10, nor of "due process" provision of the fourteenth amendment of the federal constitution. State v. Felch, 92 Vt. 477, 105 A. 23 (1918).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section did not abridge privileges or immunities of United States citizenship in violation of fourteenth amendment simply because it offended double jeopardy provision of fifth amendment. State v. Felch, 92 Vt. 477, 105 A. 23 (1918).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        A remedial statute is one designed to cure a mischief or remedy a defect in existing laws, and this section, allowing state exceptions in criminal cases, is remedial, and its construction should be liberal, and, within its language, commensurate with its purpose. In re Dexter, 93 Vt. 304, 107 A. 134 (1919).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section gave right of exception to state in criminal case equal in all respects to that possessed by respondent. State v. Felch, 92 Vt. 477, 105 A. 23 (1918).

        Under V.R.C.P. 6(a), when the period of time prescribed by rule, court order, or applicable statute is less than eleven days, intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and state or federal legal holidays are excluded from the computation of the time period so that discounting weekend days and holidays, the State's motion and notice of appeal under 13 V.S.A.
        §
        7403 were filed within seven days, and therefore were timely. State v. Hanlon, 164 Vt. 125, 665 A.2d 603 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        13 V.S.A.
        §
        7403(e) is plainly an "applicable statute" for purposes of the computation of the time period in which an appeal may be filed pursuant to V.R.C.P. 6(a). State v. Hanlon, 164 Vt. 125, 665 A.2d 603 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Applying court rules V.R.A.P. 26(a) and V.R.C.P. 6(a) to 13 V.S.A.
        §
        7403 does not enlarge or modify any substantive rights provided by law. State v. Hanlon, 164 Vt. 125, 665 A.2d 603 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court has the same discretion to impose conditions of release under subsec. (e) of this section as it does under section 7554 of this title, governing release in noncapital cases prior to trial, and there is no limitation with respect thereto. State v. Parda, 142 Vt. 261, 455 A.2d 323 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no conflict between this section and section 2382 of Title 12. State v. Benjamin, 124 Vt. 20, 196 A.2d 507 (1963).

         5. Procedure.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Since subdiv. (c)(1) of this section provides that the state shall "be allowed" to appeal a ruling suppressing evidence, in order to allow the appeal, the trial court must receive a motion from the state requesting such allowance. State v. Corliss, 145 Vt. 169, 484 A.2d 924 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the state failed to move the trial court for permission to appeal a ruling suppressing evidence, the supreme court was without jurisdiction to hear the appeal. State v. Corliss, 145 Vt. 169, 484 A.2d 924 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an appeal is from the dismissal of an indictment or information, subsec. (d) of this section, requiring the certification for allowance of the appeal by the attorney for the state, is not applicable, since it relates only to appeals under subsec. (c), and V.R.A.P. 5(b)(1), requiring the trial court's approval of the appeal, is not applicable, since the order appealed from is not interlocutory. State v. Clarke, 145 Vt. 659, 487 A.2d 1079 (mem.) (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        There are two steps involved in bringing questions to the supreme court before final judgment. The first is to obtain recorded permission from the court concerned to bring up to the supreme court the questions to be decided, and failure to do this means failure to confer the jurisdiction necessary to deal with the case at all at that point. The second step, required by supreme court Rule 2A [2], is to obtain from the certifying court a signed statement of the questions to be presented in the supreme court for review. Even though jurisdiction may have been conferred by step one, if the statement of questions is lacking, the supreme court may refuse to accept the attempted certification. State v. Mahoney, 126 Vt. 258, 227 A.2d 401 (1967).

         6. Bail.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Subsec. (e) of this section permits the trial court to deny bail altogether in appropriate cases. State v. Parda, 142 Vt. 261, 455 A.2d 323 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution for kidnapping and sexual assault, where the state took an interlocutory appeal from the granting of a motion to suppress, and the trial court imposed certain conditions of release, which included the requirement of a bail bond or cash deposit of $50,000, the trial court's order was not improper since subsec. (e) of this section does not prohibit imposition of monetary bail conditions and the trial court had carefully considered evidence presented by defendant, and determined that monetary bail was warranted. State v. Parda, 142 Vt. 261, 455 A.2d 323 (1982).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where state certified that denial of motion in limine to exclude evidence seriously impeded continuation of prosecution but failed to make any specific allegations why delay of evidentiary ruling until trial would have this effect, in absence of a detailed statement of reasons for the conclusory certification, trial court could not make necessary finding to allow an appeal under this section and V.R.A.P. 5(b)(1)(C), and grant of interlocutory appeal was error. State v. Dubois, 150 Vt. 600, 556 A.2d 86 (1988).

       <p>
        Under this section, questions of law raised by state's exceptions must be passed to supreme court before entry of final judgment in lower court. State v. Austin, 118 Vt. 259, 108 A.2d 401 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, in cases in which the state feels that it may or will desire to present to the supreme court questions of law raised below it should request the trial court to withhold entry of final judgment until a bill of exceptions can be prepared and signed setting forth claimed errors. State v. Austin, 118 Vt. 259, 108 A.2d 401 (1954).
       </p>
       <p>
        No exceptions were available to the state after final judgment. State v. Green Mt. Power Corp., 113 Vt. 34, 28 A.2d 698 (1942).

        State's motion for permission to appeal from suppression order was timely where original motion was timely, and amended motion, which added "seriously" to conform to V.R.A.P. 5, was filed later. State v. Lewis, 151 Vt. 38, 556 A.2d 59 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        State's failure to appeal order dismissing charge of larceny from the person within seven days after that order had been rendered, pursuant to subsec. (e) of this section, gave rise to a jurisdictional defect. State v. Mason, 147 Vt. 647, 518 A.2d 366 (mem.) (1986).

       <p>
        Where the state took exceptions, and there was a verdict of acquittal, the court properly refused to render judgment on verdict, because this section expressly authorized court, in its discretion, to pass case to supreme court on state's exceptions before final judgment; and, record not showing that court did not rule on this question as matter of discretion, it will be taken that it did.

        The "questions of law decided against the state" were not confined to express decisions, but could be either express or implied; and allowance of exception amounting to an implied ruling that repetition of question previously exclude was legally proper, was tantamount to an express ruling to that effect.

       <p>
        Statutory list of orders appealable by the State does not include judgments of acquittal, whether pre- or post-verdict, and thus did not entitle the State to appeal a post-guilty-verdict judgment of acquittal. The plain language of the statute is not unclear or ambiguous; it does not provide a mechanism for the State to appeal a judgment of acquittal. State v. Roy, 209 Vt. 133, 203 A.3d 1177 (2018).

        No appeal is available to the state in criminal actions without a discretionary ruling of the trial court, passing the cause to the supreme court before final judgment. State v. Benjamin, 124 Vt. 20, 196 A.2d 507 (1963).

        Charging defendant as habitual criminal was not "double enhancement" of his prior convictions for DUI, and since defendant properly faced charge punishable by life imprisonment, he could lawfully be held without bail. State v. Gardner, 167 Vt. 600, 709 A.2d 499 (mem.) (1998).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial judge has the discretion to allow bail even where a defendant is not entitled to it; moreover, a defendant is entitled to a hearing to inform the district court's discretion. Thus, defendant, who had been denied bail, was entitled to a hearing on whether he was bailable in the discretion of the trial court. State v. Falzo, 185 Vt. 616, 969 A.2d 694 (mem.) (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defense counsel's refusal to participate in a hearing on whether defendant was bailable in the trial court's discretion due to his belief that defendant's appeal divested the district court of jurisdiction did not waive defendant's right to a hearing on whether he was bailable. Whatever confusion counsel might have labored under was not to work to defendant's disadvantage. State v. Falzo, 185 Vt. 616, 969 A.2d 694 (mem.) (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly denied defendant's motion for a second bail review hearing. Defendant's motion for a second hearing merely indicated that defendant had identified two other possible custodial living situations; as indicated in the trial court's earlier order, however, defendant was not denied bail just because the trial court found his original custodial proposal unacceptable. State v. Bushey, 185 Vt. 597, 969 A.2d 119 (mem.) (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a bail hearing in which the trial court is required to determine whether a defendant is bailable in light of evidence of guilt, the trial court is not required to consider a challenge to admission of evidence if substantial admissible evidence of guilt exists without considering the evidence challenged; but if the state cannot make such a showing, the court must determine if the state can make a prima facie case that the challenged evidence would be admissible at trial. State v. Passino, 154 Vt. 377, 577 A.2d 281 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's failure to exercise its discretion to consider bail for defendant charged with first degree murder not bailable as of right due to weight of evidence of his guilt required remand for such consideration. State v. Passino, 154 Vt. 377, 577 A.2d 281 (1990).

       <p>
        Defendant charged with an offense punishable by life imprisonment is entitled to a hearing on conditions of release. State v. Duff, 151 Vt. 433, 563 A.2d 258 (1989).

         3. Findings.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In denying bail, the trial court, which relied primarily on its findings that there was no acceptable responsible adult who could supervise defendant and that defendant would not abide by any conditions of release, was not required to explicitly consider each statutory bail factor. State v. Auclair, 211 Vt. 651, 229 A.3d 1019 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        In finding that a sexual assault defendant could be held without bail, the trial court properly found that the evidence of guilt was great, as the testimony of the alleged victim, even if ambivalent, could provide a legally sufficient basis for a guilty verdict if found credible. State v. Bertrand, 185 Vt. 574, 967 A.2d 1137 (mem.) (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the record of the proceedings, did not indicate how the trial court, which denied bail, exercised its discretion in rejecting defendant's proposed conditions of release, remand was required for the trial court to make findings on this issue. State v. Bertrand, 185 Vt. 574, 967 A.2d 1137 (mem.) (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order that defendant be held without bail did not comply with the statute governing release in cases punishable by life imprisonment when the trial court had not found that the evidence of guilt was great. State v. Winn, 184 Vt. 639, 964 A.2d 1178 (mem.) (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant charged with an offense punishable by life imprisonment could be held without bail if state established by affidavits, depositions, sworn oral testimony, or other admissible evidence that it had substantial, admissible evidence as to the elements of the offense sufficient to prevent the grant of a motion for judgment of acquittal at trial. State v. Blackmer, 160 Vt. 451, 631 A.2d 1134 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        To deny bail to defendant charged with an offense punishable by life imprisonment, trial court must make a specific finding that state has shown that facts exist that are legally sufficient to sustain a verdict of guilty. State v. Duff, 151 Vt. 433, 563 A.2d 258 (1989).

         4. Discretion.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Even though defendant was not entitled to bail pursuant to this section, the trial court had discretion to allow bail. The court adequately exercised its discretion to deny bail where it considered certain factors set forth in 13 V.S.A.
        §
        7554, including defendant's family ties, employment, financial resources, and record of convictions, and concluded that because defendant did not have extensive ties to the community and lacked employment, he posed a risk of flight sufficient to deny bail. State v. Avgoustov, 180 Vt. 595, 907 A.2d 1185 (mem.) (August 7, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        In cases where constitutional right to bail does not apply, presumption is switched so that the norm is incarceration and not release, trial court's discretion is extremely broad, and trial court must exercise its discretion after giving defendant an opportunity to be heard. State v. Blackmer, 160 Vt. 451, 631 A.2d 1134 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant charged with an offense punishable by life imprisonment could be held without bail where sufficient admissible evidence would show that evidence of guilt was great. State v. Blackmer, 160 Vt. 451, 631 A.2d 1134 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court has discretion to allow bail where defendant is charged with an offense punishable by life imprisonment, even though evidence of guilt is great. State v. Duff, 151 Vt. 433, 563 A.2d 258 (1989).

         5. Review.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In a bail review hearing, the trial court used the correct standard when evaluating the evidence, which was that the trial court had to review the State's evidence in the light most favorable to the State, excluding the effect of any modifying evidence introduced by the defendant. State v. Whittemore, 196 Vt. 608, - A.3d -
    (mem.) (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Remand was required because the record did not indicate how the trial court exercised its discretion in deciding not to grant defendant's bail request. State v. Whittemore, 196 Vt. 608, - A.3d -
    (mem.) (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether the trial court erred in finding that the evidence of defendant's guilt was great under the statute governing release in cases punishable by life imprisonment, it was irrelevant whether the trial court properly took evidence about Battered Women's Syndrome into account. The question was not how the trial court reached a particular decision about the weight of the evidence but instead whether admissible, substantial evidence objectively supported a finding of guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Hardy, 184 Vt. 618, 965 A.2d 478 (mem.) (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Substantial, admissible evidence of guilt supported the trial court's denial of bail to defendant charged with aggravated sexual assault. State v. Avgoustov, 180 Vt. 595, 907 A.2d 1185 (mem.) (August 7, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court utilized the proper standard of review for denial of bail to defendant charged with an offense punishable by life imprisonment, i.e., "whether the evidence, taken in the light most favorable to the State and excluding modifying evidence, can fairly and reasonably show defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt", and properly excluded affidavits submitted by defendant, holding that they represented conflicting or modifying evidence. State v. Turnbaugh, 174 Vt. 532, 811 A.2d 662 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Record supported trial court's decision that defendant charged with aggravated sexual assault on a nine-year-old girl be held without bail. State v. Blackmer, 160 Vt. 451, 631 A.2d 1134 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In holding defendant, who was charged with sexual assault, without bail, the trial court did not err in finding that the evidence of guilt was great, because the victim clearly testified that although the encounter was initially consensual, she asked defendant to "stop" once he became violent, after which he nonetheless tried to forcefully initiate anal sex. State v. Blodgett, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (June 11, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was error to order defendant to be held without bail because while defendant purchased a gun and planned to purchase at least one more, planned to conduct surveillance at a high school, sent messages on social media to the effect that he planned to commit a shooting at the school, wrote at length in his journal that he currently planned to commit such an act at some future time, kept lists of the items that he needed before actually committing a shooting at the school, many of which he did not have, and researched the school calendar to select an optimal date for the planned shooting, he took no action so proximate to the commission of a school shooting as to constitute an attempt, but engaged only in these preparatory acts. State v. Sawyer, 207 Vt. 638, 187 A.3d 377 (mem.) (Apr. 11, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in holding defendant without bail without considering whether any of the statutory factors weighed in favor of defendant's pretrial release. State v. Collins, 205 Vt. 632, 177 A.3d 528 (mem.) (Sept. 8, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in deciding to hold defendant, who was charged with second-degree murder, without bail after concluding that releasing her on bail with a condition that she stay with one of the proposed custodians would not sufficiently limit flight risk and risk to public safety. Defendant's mother-in-law was already supervising a probationer, whose probation might be affected if defendant moved in, and the mother-in-law's son had a criminal record; defendant's brother and his adult family members had criminal records and in the case of the family members did not testify as to their availability. State v. Shores, 204 Vt. 630, 168 A.3d 471 (May 4, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was sufficient evidence that defendant's guilt was great for purposes of the statute regarding release on bail in cases punishable by life imprisonment when defendant's claim that her husband shot himself was inconsistent with the physical evidence and when defendant was the only other person in her home the night the husband was shot. State v. Shores, 204 Vt. 630, 168 A.3d 471 (May 4, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        When defendant was charged with attempted first-degree murder and kidnapping, the trial court properly denied bail under the statute dealing with cases punishable by life imprisonment, as the weight of the evidence was enough to give rise to a presumption for incarceration and the trial court considered several of the factors under the pretrial release statute, including the seriousness of the charges and the violent threats by defendant and the fact that his violent threats and actions involved innocent bystanders. State v. Ford, 200 Vt. 650, 130 A.3d 862 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly denied bail to defendant, who was charged with second-degree aggravated domestic assault. It considered his prior violations of abuse prevention orders, his additional prior convictions and violations of probation, the repeated threatening and demeaning text messages that defendant sent to his wife, and the current high emotional state of the couple's relationship in the midst of a separation and divorce, even though the trial court did not feel that risk of flight was a major concern and counted defendant's employment and stable residence with his mother as positive factors. State v. Baker, 199 Vt. 639, 116 A.3d 1192 (mem.) (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Interview transcript contained statements by the victim that sufficiently approximated an oath and thus was admissible as a sworn statement in the context of a bail review hearing. Any flaws in the interview process itself went to the weight that the evidence should be given at trial. State v. Whittemore, 196 Vt. 608, - A.3d -
    (mem.) (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Remand was required when the trial court denied defendant bail. First, the trial court treated the State's post-hearing filings as evidence without allowing defendant any opportunity to react; second, because it made no findings regarding defendant's risk of flight or risk to safety, and did not conduct any hearing on conditions of release, it completely withheld its discretion as to whether defendant should be released. State v. Harper, 196 Vt. 618, - A.3d - (mem.) (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no merit to defendant's argument that his denial of bail violated federal due process. A presumption of incarceration under the statute regarding release in cases punishable by life imprisonment did not violate due process. State v. Brillon, 188 Vt. 537, 996 A.2d 1187 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant, who was charged with second-degree domestic assault and faced a maximum penalty of life in prison based on his alleged status as a habitual offender, was properly ordered held without bail while awaiting retrial. The evidence of guilt was great, as defendant had been previously convicted under much of the evidence that would likely be presented at retrial, and there was ample support for the conclusion that defendant, who had a history of assaultive behavior toward the complainant while under conditions of release, would not comply with conditions of release and would pose a risk to the public. State v. Brillon, 188 Vt. 537, 996 A.2d 1187 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        While it was true that defendant was not charged under the habitual offender statute - a statute that acted as a sentencing enhancement, not as a separate criminal violation - and that the felonies with which defendant was charged were not in themselves punishable by life imprisonment, this did not change the fact that defendant was charged with several felonies that, for him, were punishable by life imprisonment under the habitual offender statute. The plain language of the statute governing release in cases punishable by life imprisonment unambiguously applied to defendant, and the rule of lenity was therefore inapplicable. State v. Pellerin, 187 Vt. 482, 996 A.2d 204 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly found that the evidence of guilt was great and that defendant could therefore be held without bail. The State submitted numerous affidavits regarding the alleged felony dispensation of regulated drugs to a minor, and a search revealed Vicodin at defendant's home; regarding the lewd and lascivious conduct charge, the trial court found strong and admissible evidence that defendant was guilty of this charge based on an affidavit describing defendant's acts of lifting the victim's shirt and pulling down the victim's underpants to take photographs of her vagina and buttocks. State v. Pellerin, 187 Vt. 482, 996 A.2d 204 (2010).

        Trial court properly exercised its discretion to deny bail when it found that defendant had a long history of sexual offenses and used his home to facilitate his proximity to his target victims of young girls; that defendant appeared to suffer from compulsive and antisocial conduct that endangered the public; and that there remained a moderate risk of flight if defendant, who had allegedly stated that he "could not go back to jail," were released on bail. State v. Pellerin, 187 Vt. 482, 996 A.2d 204 (2010).

        Defendant was not entitled to be released from custody pending the outcome of a hearing on whether he was bailable in the discretion of the trial court. Where a trial court has determined that the evidence indicating that a defendant committed a crime punishable by life imprisonment is great, and that decision is supported by the record, the trial court may order the defendant held without bail pending the outcome of a hearing on whether the defendant may be released on conditions. State v. Falzo, 185 Vt. 616, 969 A.2d 694 (mem.) (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a case where defendant was charged with sexual assault and lewd and lascivious conduct with a child, there was no reason to dispute the trial court's finding in denying defendant bail that the evidence of his guilt was great. Defendant offered no support for his argument that an oral statement attested to by the complainant at the end of her statement was less admissible than a written affidavit attested to by her at the bottom of the statement; moreover, even if the complainant's interview were not admitted, the trial court could still rely on defendant's own sworn admissions that he and the complainant engaged in sexual intercourse and other sexual acts. State v. Bushey, 185 Vt. 597, 969 A.2d 119 (mem.) (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no merit to defendant's argument that a hearing was not a bail review. The trial court specifically stated that it was a bail review hearing; moreover, the trial court considered not just the evidence against defendant, but also the testimony offered by defendant's witness as well as the factors bearing on whether the court could allow bail and conditions of release even though defendant was not entitled to bail as a matter of right. State v. Bushey, 185 Vt. 597, 969 A.2d 119 (mem.) (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Record supported the trial court's decision to hold defendant, who was charged with domestic assault and being a habitual offender, without bail. Although the victim's testimony at the hearing was inconsistent with her earlier statements, her testimony did not convincingly undermine her earlier account, which accurately matched the state of the crime scene, and a detective testified that in his experience, the victim's hoarse voice, red eyes, and discolored neck were consistent with strangulation. State v. Hardy, 184 Vt. 618, 965 A.2d 478 (mem.) (2008).

        Denial of bail to defendant charged with aggravated sexual assault on a nine-year-old girl did not deny defendant of procedural due process. State v. Blackmer, 160 Vt. 451, 631 A.2d 1134 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        To meet substantive due process requirements, bail cannot be denied in order to inflict pretrial punishment, pretrial detention cannot be excessive in relation to regulatory goal, and interests served by the detention must be legitimate and compelling.

        State, which sought to hold defendant without bail, failed to present "great" evidence of guilt, because when the complainant's inadmissible out-of-court statements offered through the trooper's sworn affidavit were excluded, the admissible evidence showed only that the complainant and defendant were in a sexual relationship, that there had been four or five previous incidents in which defendant had harmed the complainant, that the trooper observed a red mark on the complainant's neck, and that she was crying and fearful. State v. Crawford, 208 Vt. 662, 200 A.3d 1086 (mem.) (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the State simply alleged that a sworn recording of the complainant's statements to a trooper existed, and represented that the trooper's affidavit conveyed her sworn statements, the trooper's recollection of the complainant's statements did not demonstrate that the State had admissible evidence of defendant's guilt that it could use at trial. State v. Crawford, 208 Vt. 662, 200 A.3d 1086 (mem.) (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sworn interview with the six-year-old alleged victim was the functional equivalent of an affidavit, and the fact that the victim attested to his statement at the end of the interview rather than at the beginning did not negate its admissibility in the weight-of-the-evidence hearing. State v. Hugerth, 208 Vt. 657, 194 A.3d 1189 (mem.) (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Interview with the six-year-old alleged victim in which the interviewing officer emphasized the importance of telling the truth, the alleged victim affirmed that he had told the truth, and the alleged victim demonstrated that he knew the difference between the truth and a lie was admissible in the weight-of-the-evidence hearing. State v. Hugerth, 208 Vt. 657, 194 A.3d 1189 (mem.) (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        In conducting a bail hearing, the trial court properly found that the evidence of defendant's guilt of second-degree murder was great, as the medical examiner reported that the two-year-old victim died from trauma to his abdomen, there was evidence narrowing the likely window of the time of the injury and the list of people who had the opportunity to inflict it, the victim's mother contradicted defendant's testimony about when defendant came to bed, and before the cause of death had been revealed, defendant told police he thought that the victim had been complaining about his stomach. State v. Theriault, 198 Vt. 625, 109 A.3d 448 (mem.) (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        With regard to the trial court's finding that defendant's guilt of second-degree murder was great, there was sufficient evidence on the element of specific intent because if the jury believed defendant committed the alleged wrongful act of striking the two-year-old victim in the stomach with a forceful blow, it could thereby also find intent to do great bodily harm or wanton disregard that such harm would result. State v. Theriault, 198 Vt. 625, 109 A.3d 448 (mem.) (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        In some cases, the underlying validity of nontestimonial evidence at bail denial hearings may be disputed; for example, a photograph may purport to show a defendant in another state at the time of an alleged crime, but other evidence may support that the photo was doctored, or its quality may be so poor that the state could reasonably argue that it did not show the defendant at all. In such a case, the evidence would properly be considered modifying evidence because it raises a factual question - such as whether a photograph really showed the defendant - that must be left for the jury at trial. State v. Stolte, 191 Vt. 600, 44 A.3d 166 (mem.) (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        "Modifying evidence" for purposes of determining whether to deny bail is testimonial evidence introduced by the defense in contravention to the State's evidence, the credibility or weight of which is ultimately for the factfinder's determination. State v. Stolte, 191 Vt. 600, 44 A.3d 166 (mem.) (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether to deny defendant bail, it was error to necessarily equate defendant's new DNA evidence, purportedly undisputed as to its foundation, with disputed, testimonial "modifying evidence." On remand, if the proffered evidence, if relevant, was disputed either as to its origin or result as a matter of fact, then the evidence was modifying evidence; if no such conflict existed, the court had to determine whether, if admissible, the evidence would have made a difference to its initial determination on whether the State's prima facie evidence of guilt was "great" for purposes of holding defendant without bail. State v. Stolte, 191 Vt. 600, 44 A.3d 166 (mem.) (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        While testimonial evidence raises inherent credibility questions not properly resolved by judges at bail denial hearings, nontestimonial evidence does not. Nontestimonial evidence is any evidence which does not derive and depend on the observation, recollection, reliability, or veracity of witnesses, whether in the form of live testimony or a sworn statement, and which therefore does not implicate a credibility determination. State v. Stolte, 191 Vt. 600, 44 A.3d 166 (mem.) (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Examples of nontestimonial evidence at bail denial hearings can include DNA analysis, photographs, or other physical evidence, the provenance of which is not contested. Where the validity of such nontestimonial evidence is undisputed, there is no question of credibility. For example, in the case of an indisputably valid DNA result, the jury would not be required to decide whether it believed the test result, but only what it proved. State v. Stolte, 191 Vt. 600, 44 A.3d 166 (mem.) (2012).

       <p>
        Trial court did not err in ordering that defendant be held without bail when it weighed the nature and circumstances of the offenses charged, including attempted second-degree murder, the danger to the public defendant represented and his unwillingness to follow law enforcement orders, the testimony of defendant's friend, defendant's convictions of resisting arrest and simple assault, and the absence of prior failures to appear in court or bail violations. State v. Book, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (Apr. 30, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in continuing to hold defendant without bail, as it revisited his due process argument and considered his significant history of violence, his prior failures to abide by court orders and conditions of parole, and the fact all four charges carried a potential sentence of life imprisonment, and found that it could not be assured that the friend with whom defendant proposed to reside could enforce the conditions to protect the public or to prevent flight to avoid prosecution. State v. Boyer, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (Mar. 15, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to reconsider a hold-without-bail order, as new time-constraint evidence was modifying evidence excluded from the analysis in that it was for the factfinder's determination and did nothing more than undermine the complainant's credibility, the evidence of guilt was great, and the trial court considered conditions of release but found that these conditions would not mitigate defendant's risk of flight or danger to the public. State v. Blow, - Vt.
    - , 251 A.3d 517 (Nov. 25, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in denying a first-degree murder defendant bail, as there was an impetus for flight not present before defendant's arrest, there was evidence that defendant had violated a no-contact requirement, defendant's mother, the proposed responsible adult, showed little ability to control what occurred at her home and had facilitated defendant's prohibited contact, and the trial court did not abuse its broad discretion in failing to determine that the State's case was weak. State v. Auclair, 211 Vt. 651, 229 A.3d 1019 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly denied defendant bail in a docket that included sexual assault charges involving his daughter, as the evidence of guilt, including an affidavit by the daughter, was great and the trial court considered the seriousness of the numerous charges against defendant, the charges that defendant violated outstanding protective orders, the obstruction-of-justice charge, the fact that five of the charges involved potential life imprisonment, and the change in defendant's family dynamics. State v. Orost, 206 Vt. 657, 179 A.3d 763 (mem.) (Nov. 22, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was error to deny bail when the dockets contained no charges carrying potential penalties of life imprisonment, the State had not clearly asked for the trial court to hold defendant without bail, and the trial court had not made the required findings. State v. Orost, 206 Vt. 657, 179 A.3d 763 (mem.) (Nov. 22, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        In denying defendant bail, the trial court properly assessed all the elements of the statute under which defendant was charged, and did not rely on the convictions themselves from defendant's first trial but rather on the testimony contained within the trial. State v. Rondeau, 204 Vt. 625, 167 A.3d 332 (Mar. 21, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        In denying defendant bail, the trial court properly considered each of the factors regarding conditions of release and found that the charges of aggravated sexual assault were very serious, that no family members offered to supervise defendant, that defendant was mostly unemployed, that a number of family members testified at his first trial that he was not honest or trustworthy, that he had threatened to kill the victim, and that the evidence of guilt was great. State v. Rondeau, 204 Vt. 625, 167 A.3d 332 (Mar. 21, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        With regard to the trial court's order holding defendant without bail in a case punishable by life imprisonment, the State met its burden to show that it would have sufficient admissible evidence of guilt at trial when it introduced an oral recording of the alleged victim giving a sworn statement to two state police troopers and the victim's statement included facts which, if true, would satisfy each element of two of the charges brought against defendant. If the alleged victim testified at trial, the same statement would be admissible evidence and a jury could reasonably find defendant guilty of the charged offenses. State v. Bullock, 204 Vt. 633, 165 A.3d 143 (mem.) (Jan. 27, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly denied bail to defendant, who was charged with first-degree murder. Improperly admitted evidence did not significantly tip the balance in the State's favor; the facts, taken together, created a prima facie case that defendant shot the victim in the head from at least five feet away; and the evident necessity of taking the revolver from the closet of the room where defendant kept it and carrying it into the bedroom where the victim was shot allowed the trial court to reasonably infer premeditation. State v. Bolesky, 196 Vt. 613, - A.3d - (mem.) (2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        When defendant was charged with kidnapping, the trial court properly denied him bail. It acknowledged those aspects of the offense that favored defendant, but also concluded that he had put two children and others at risk of grave harm and that he had threatened to take an infant; furthermore, it found that while many of his convictions were not recent, his overall record further contributed to a conclusion that he should not be released on conditions. State v. Putnam, 196 Vt. 616, - A.3d - (mem.) (2008).

       <p>
        Court ordered that defendant, who was charged with aggravated domestic assault and other crimes, continue to be held without bail. The proposal to release him to the care of his mother at a monastery was inadequate to protect the public and the complainant from serious bodily injury, given the risk of defendant drinking and resorting to life-threatening violence.

        State proved by clear and convincing evidence that no condition or combination of conditions of release would reasonably prevent physical violence for purposes of denying bail to defendant, as it was not certain that the only condition proposed by defendant, that his fiance supervise him continuously, could even be implemented.

The complainant testified that defendant had threatened her with violence if he found her with another man and that there were "repercussions" for people who wronged him; defendant had been convicted of serious felonies 16 years before as a juvenile and still bragged about them; the complainant testified that after hearing a man's voice on the phone, defendant brandished a knife and threatened to scar her with boiled baby oil; and defendant was aware that the complainant had testified against him. State v. Weaver, 198 Vt. 635, 114 A.3d 1151 (mem.) (2015).

       <p>
        In ordering that defendant be held without bail, the trial court properly found that no condition or combination of conditions of release would reasonably prevent the physical violence. Defendant's proposed custodian, his fiance, worked full-time; more important, the evidence showed that defendant was capable of acts of extreme dangerous, as shown by his loss of control in the face of a stray phone call, his brandishing of a knife, and his threats to scar the complainant with hot baby oil. State v. Weaver, 198 Vt. 635, 114 A.3d 1151 (mem.) (2015).

       <p>
        It was not error to hold defendant without bail on the ground that his release posed an unavoidable threat of violence, given the domineering and violent behavior perpetrated by defendant, who continued to contact the complaining witness despite an explicit order prohibiting any contact. State v. Hughes, 197 Vt. 648, 109 A.3d 433 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Following an evidentiary hearing on appeal from a denial of bail, the court directed that a domestic violence defendant be held without bail. The evidence of guilt was great; defendant had assaulted the complainant in the past and had violated prior no-contact orders; he had an extensive criminal history, including felony convictions; and withholding the complainant's address was unlikely to prevent future contact, as the complainant had returned to defendant in the past. State v. Gorman, 36 Vt. 660, 190 A.3d 660 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was entitled to release on bail based on the fact that the victim did not appear to be in danger, as she requested contact with defendant, and there was no clear and convincing evidence that his release posed a threat that could not be prevented with conditions of release. State v. Stevens, 174 Vt. 450, 806 A.2d 1000 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        The standard of evidence necessary to hold defendant without bail was met where victim repeatedly told defendant she had strong feelings about premarital sex, where victim, who had been drinking, blacked out and awoke to find defendant on top of her and engaged in sexual intercourse, and where defendant corroborated victim's testimony in large part except to state that the victim consented. State v. Madison, 163 Vt. 390, 659 A.2d 124 (1995).

        The purpose for confidentiality of juvenile records is protection of the child from the prejudice generated by public scrutiny; confidentiality should not serve as a shield to consideration of the facts necessary to carry out the judicial function under
        §
        7553a, which provides for the denial of release on bail of persons who commit acts of violence. State v. Madison, 163 Vt. 390, 659 A.2d 124 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where juvenile records were kept confidential in large measure by the court and only referred to in a general way, court did not err in considering them to determine if defendant posed a substantial threat to any person. State v. Madison, 163 Vt. 390, 659 A.2d 124 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was clear and convincing that defendant's release posed a substantial threat of physical violence for purposes of denying him bail under 13 V.S.A.
        §
        7553a where defendant threatened the victim by driving his jeep at a dangerous rate of speed into the parking lot of a restaurant, toward the victim who was standing outside, and fishtailed to a stop at or very near where the victim had been before she escaped. State v. Madison, 163 Vt. 390, 659 A.2d 124 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was properly denied bail under 13 V.S.A.
        §
        7553a where numerous, and sometimes serious, violations of juvenile probation and conditions of release, reflected in juvenile record, convincingly demonstrated that conditions of release, in sexual assault case, would not prove effective to keep defendant from posing a significant threat not only to the victim but to other young women. State v. Madison, 163 Vt. 390, 659 A.2d 124 (1995).

       <p>
        State was not entitled to hold defendant without bail, as it had not shown that a threat of violence could not be prevented by strict conditions of release, including the requirement that he reside with and be supervised by his sister and her family, who would supervise defendant in person any time he was outside their residence and report any violations promptly to law enforcement; who did not keep alcohol, which was tied to defendant's criminal history, in their residence; who lived in a separate county from the complainant; and who had effectively supervised defendant in the past.

       </p>
       <p>
        It was error to deny bail when the dockets contained no charges carrying potential penalties of life imprisonment, the State had not clearly asked for the trial court to hold defendant without bail, and the trial court had not made the required findings.

        Denial of bail in a domestic violence case was not warranted, as the State had not proven that no condition or combination of conditions of release would reasonably prevent the physical violence. Defendant's criminal history was minimal, he had no disciplinary infractions while incarcerated, and he had responded to intervention in the past. State v. Lontine, 201 Vt. 637, 142 A.3d 1058 (mem.)

        Trial court did not err in holding defendant without bail, as the evidence of guilt of aggravated domestic assault and criminal threatening was great in that the evidence included statements by defendant's parents that defendant tried to strike them with a hammer, defendant's violent behavior, which occurred at a time when he was on probation for simple assault, had been virtually unprovoked, and the court was not convinced that defendant's sister, who would allow defendant to live with her but who worked full-time and had a newborn child, had the ability to control defendant's conduct or to prevent defendant from behaving in a violent manner.

        The purpose of allowing bail to be forfeited is not to punish defendant, but to ensure that he will appear at court when required. State v. Cardinal, 147 Vt. 461, 520 A.2d 984 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of bail, as presently mandated by the constitution, is to assure the defendant's presence in court, and it cannot be used as a means of punishing the defendant or protecting the public. State v. Pray, 133 Vt. 537, 346 A.2d 227 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        One of the laudable purposes of the bail statutes is to avoid the deliberate use of an unattainable bail figure to accomplish a restraint for the protection of the public, since restraint is possible under conditions set out in the statutes.

         6. Conditions.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to amend his conditions of release to remove the condition prohibiting him from possessing firearms, as defendant, who was charged with first-degree aggravated domestic assault with a deadly weapon, brought forth no evidence to show that the trial court should no longer have concerns over his alleged substance abuse or mental health, other than that he was an avid hunter, did not hunt the previous year as a result of the condition, and wished to hunt in the upcoming deer season. State v. Parker, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (Nov. 9, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly modified defendant's conditions of release to prohibit him from contacting the complainant, his wife, as the prosecutor's unchallenged representation to the trial court that defendant violated the existing contact condition of release by discussing the case with the complainant was sufficient for the trial court to find that it was reasonably necessary to modify the condition. State v. Woods, 203 Vt. 659, 153 A.3d 1231 (Dec. 1, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly imposed a condition of release precluding defendant from having contact with her four children except under certain conditions, because although the children were not the alleged victims of the misdemeanor assault charged here, two separate individuals told police that defendant had threatened the lives of the children, and one of those persons, defendant's mother, told police at the scene of the crime that defendant had threatened to slash each one of her children's throats, call the police, and have them shoot her. State v. Rabtoy, 203 Vt. 659, 153 A.3d 1231 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        As defendant in a domestic violence case had deep roots in the community, monetary bail was not required, but the case warranted conditions of release which included having no contact with the victim, undergoing substance abuse treatment, and not possessing firearms. State v. Lontine, 201 Vt. 637, 142 A.3d 1058 (mem.) (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Pretrial release statute expressly authorizes the trial court to impose a no-contact condition, and the trial court is not bound to impose the "least restrictive" condition to prevent contact with a victim, nor must it find extraordinary circumstances to impose a condition restricting contact; it may simply order that no contact occur. Thus, when defendant was charged with the domestic assault of his girlfriend, the trial court did not err in imposing a condition of release that defendant not contact her, as the condition as imposed was supported by the record in that the trial court believed the testimony of bouncers who witnessed the incident over that of the girlfriend denying the assault. State v. Cushing, 200 Vt. 646, 128 A.3d 896 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        In imposing a no-contact condition of release in a domestic assault case, the trial court adequately considered the statutory factors. Notwithstanding defendant's argument that the court erred by not considering all the factors, such as his family ties, his length of residency in the community, and the circumstances surrounding the assault, the Court could not say that the trial court exercised its discretion in a clearly untenable manner. State v. Cushing, 200 Vt. 646, 128 A.3d 896 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Rule regarding revocation of probation expressly requires courts to consider the factors in subsec. (b) of the pretrial release statute when determining conditions of release for probationers, and while subsec. (b) references subsec. (a), that subsection is inapplicable to probationers because it presumes release; thus, subsec. (a)'s requirement that a defendant "shall . . . be ordered released pending trial in accordance with this statute" is inapplicable, and also inapplicable is the requirement of subdiv. (a)(1) that the court must impose "the least restrictive . . . conditions which will reasonably assure the appearance of the person." All that is necessary is a consideration of the subsec. (b) factors. State v. Campbell, 198 Vt. 627, 100 A.3d 289 (mem.) (Nov. 7, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was error not to dismiss a charge of violating conditions of release. The no-contact provision of the boilerplate form given to defendant, who contacted the complainant while still in jail, took effect only upon release; furthermore, the trial court did not advise defendant that the order was effective immediately regardless of his custodial status, as required by the pretrial release statute. State v. Tavis, 186 Vt. 554, 978 A.2d 465 (mem.) (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        "In connection with a prosecution" should be read naturally and plainly to restrict subsec. 7559(d) to a subset of 7554 conditions specifying the time and place of appearances, such as court appearances, that directly advance a prosecution. In re Miller, 185 Vt. 550, 975 A.2d 1226 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that defendant was not entitled to be released on conditions after he was charged with two violations of his conditions of probation. State v. Barrows, 172 Vt. 596, 776 A.2d 431 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court has broad discretion in setting conditions of release, but may not use forfeiture of bail as a punitive measure to enforce other conditions of release. State v. Ashley, 161 Vt. 65, 632 A.2d 1368 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court has the same discretion to impose conditions of release under section 7403 of this title, governing interlocutory appeal by the state, as it does under this section, and there is no limitation with respect thereto. State v. Parda, 142 Vt. 261, 455 A.2d 323 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Reversal of denial of bail was required where denial rested on ground that defendant was a danger to the public. State v. Mecier, 136 Vt. 336, 388 A.2d 435 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        In view of defendant's prior bail history, which included seeing a witness he was ordered not to see upon being bailed on extortion charge, and in view of proper concern for the integrity of the judicial process, lower court correctly rejected proposition by defendant, charged with shooting his wife and daughter, to effect that he be released to live at home with his wife, the prosecution's main witness. State v. Mecier, 136 Vt. 336, 388 A.2d 435 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        A condition of bail designed solely for the protection of the public may be imposed. State v. Brown, 136 Vt. 561, 396 A.2d 134 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Imposition of condition of bail to effect that defendant shall not be the subject of a new charge of a felony or a crime against a person or a like offense to the offense charged for which, after hearing, probable cause is found, was not error, as there was no denial of bail. State v. Brown, 136 Vt. 561, 396 A.2d 134 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Conclusion of law contained in order revoking bail for breach of condition of bail to effect that defendant not be charged with a like offense while on bail, which stated that "based on the preceding findings, the Court concludes it can release a person on nonmonetary conditions of release where the judicial officer determines that the release of the defendant will constitute a danger to the public," referred not to the propriety of revoking bail, but rather to the propriety of imposing the condition in the first place. State v. Brown, 136 Vt. 561, 396 A.2d 134 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the state constitution, a person whose trial on a noncapital offense is pending is bailable as a matter of right, and bail may not be denied on the ground that release would constitute a danger to the public. State v. Pray, 133 Vt. 537, 346 A.2d 227 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        The words "In determining which conditions of release will reasonably assure appearance and will not constitute a danger to the public," in this section, suggest that there is a positive duty on the part of the judicial officer to impose conditions of release which will alleviate the danger to the public, and when read in any reasonable manner with provision of the statute providing for release pending trial unless the officer determines that release will not reasonably assure the appearance of the person or will constitute a danger to the public, the words would not allow denial of bail with conditions on a finding of danger to the public. State v. Pray, 133 Vt. 537, 346 A.2d 227 (1975).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, the option of a bail bond with sufficient solvent sureties, or deposit of cash in lieu thereof, belonged to defendant, and court setting bail could not require cash unless sufficient sureties were not produced. State v. Roessell, 132 Vt. 634, 328 A.2d 118 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since a finding of danger to the public should bail be granted, and imposition of conditions for the protection of the public, are the most crucial and restrictive aspect of bail, they should not be invoked lightly, and the finding of danger must have strong factual foundation. State v. Roessell, 132 Vt. 634, 328 A.2d 118 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order continuing conditions of release of criminal defendant pending trial at $1,000 cash bail was erroneous where this section required execution of a bail bond with sufficient sureties or the deposit of cash bail in lieu thereof, and order would be remanded for imposition of proper conditions. State v. Webb, 132 Vt. 418, 320 A.2d 626 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the deprivation of liberty before trial is a drastic device and one sought to be avoided by the legislature, there must be a strong factual foundation for findings that release will not reasonably assure the appearance of the person as required or will constitute danger to the public, or both, one or more of which is necessary to the imposition of conditions upon release. State v. McInnis, 133 Vt. 20, 328 A.2d 400 (1974), overruled on other grounds, State v. Pray (1975) 133 Vt. 537, 346 A.2d 227.

        If a defendant violates conditions of release other than an appearance condition, a court can impose increasingly more severe conditions, as well as revoke the right to bail altogether. State v. Cardinal, 147 Vt. 461, 520 A.2d 984 (1986).

        Breach of conditions of bail does not inevitably require revocation of bail, but may, instead, lead to the imposition of more restrictive conditions. State v. Mecier, 136 Vt. 336, 388 A.2d 435 (1978).

        In denying bail, the trial court, which relied primarily on its findings that there was no acceptable responsible adult who could supervise defendant and that defendant would not abide by any conditions of release, was not required to explicitly consider each statutory bail factor. State v. Auclair, 211 Vt. 651, 229 A.3d 1019 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        When defendant was charged with attempted first-degree murder and kidnapping, the trial court properly denied bail under the statute dealing with cases punishable by life imprisonment, as the weight of the evidence was enough to give rise to a presumption for incarceration and the trial court considered several of the factors under the pretrial release statute, including the seriousness of the charges and the violent threats by defendant and the fact that his violent threats and actions involved innocent bystanders. State v. Ford, 200 Vt. 650, 130 A.3d 862 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        When defendant was charged with kidnapping, the trial court properly denied him bail. It acknowledged those aspects of the offense that favored defendant, but also concluded that he had put two children and others at risk of grave harm and that he had threatened to take an infant; furthermore, it found that while many of his convictions were not recent, his overall record further contributed to a conclusion that he should not be released on conditions.

        The statutory section allowing the state's attorney to commence a prosecution for criminal contempt against a person who violates a condition of release does not provide a basis for holding a defendant without bail independent from that already contained in the statute governing release prior to trial. Rather, the section requires the court to re-evaluate the conditions in place in connection with the underlying conviction upon prosecution under the section. State v.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Statutory language of the bail statute is clear: courts must take into account financial resources, including an accused's ability to post bail based upon available information, when deciding whether to impose a condition of release. Public defender applications plainly contain "available information" when provided to the court during a bail-review hearing. State v. Rougeau, 209 Vt. 535, 209 A.3d 599 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        In assessing defendant's financial resources for purposes of setting conditions of release, the trial court erred when it refused to consider the public defender application upon request by defendant, without articulating its reasons for refusing to do so, even though the State did not object. The error was harmless, however, because the trial court took as true counsel's representation that defendant was "not a person of means." State v. Rougeau, 209 Vt. 535, 209 A.3d 599 (2019).
       </p>

        Public defender applications must be taken into account when one party requests that the court consider a public defender application at a bail-review hearing for the purpose of establishing an accused's financial resources, the opposing party does not object, and the court does not offer any reason for failing to do so. State v. Rougeau, 209 Vt. 535, 209 A.3d 599 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute governing pretrial release does not require a finding that a defendant has the ability to pay a particular amount to support a trial court's bail order. State v. Pratt, 204 Vt. 282, 166 A.3d 600 (Mar. 6, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly required a secured appearance bond in the amount of $25,000, with ten percent down, when it considered defendant's lack of family ties, a stable residence, and a job, as well as the number and seriousness of his charged crimes and his recent flurry of extensive alleged criminal activity, much of which occurred while he was out on bail, and determined that while defendant was indigent and did not have any financial resources, conditions alone would be insufficient to secure his appearance. State v. Pratt, 204 Vt. 282, 166 A.3d 600 (Mar. 6, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        When defendant was charged with grand larceny and assault and robbery with a dangerous weapon, the amount of his $150,000 bail was not improper under the Vermont bail statute or excessive under the Eighth Amendment, as he was facing serious charges involving the use of a dangerous weapon that carried a potential 25-year sentence, he had two failures to appear and two probation violations, and he used a Maine address and had allegedly gone to Maine after the charged crimes. State v. Dunn, 196 Vt. 467, 93 A.3d 1057 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court's decision to impose a cash bail of $10,000 to assure appearance was not unreasonable, given the severity of the charges under 13 V.S.A.
        §
        2602, the weight of the evidence, and defendant's own professed intent to relocate to Florida to get away from his problems. Moreover, the trial court had expressly considered but rejected the less restrictive option of appointing defendant's grandmother to supervise defendant. State v. Messier, 194 Vt. 42, 71 A.3d 1246 (May 31, 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        When defendant was charged with one count of conspiracy and three counts of knowingly and unlawfully dispensing cocaine by selling crack cocaine, his $100,000 bail was not excessive under the bail statute given the seriousness of the offenses, the weight of the evidence, and defendant's limited ties to Vermont. State v. Peterson, 186 Vt. 655, 980 A.2d 811 (Aug. 11, 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court improperly applied the threat to judicial process qualification to an accused's right to bail, when it imposed a high cash bail directly because of a person received danger to the original victim, where imposition of excessive bail to obtain incarceration is forbidden and court had available other means to encourage a peaceful relationship with victim through threat of money forfeiture. State v. Wood, 157 Vt. 286, 597 A.2d 312 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant need not be capable of meeting bail in order for the amount to be supported by the record. State v. Duff, 151 Vt. 433, 563 A.2d 258 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where sole support for high cash bail requirement was the indigent defendant was charged with a very serious crime an faced a long period of incarceration and record contained no evidence of risk of flight beyond the charge, $150,000 bail requirement was excessive under this section. State v. Duff, 151 Vt. 433, 563 A.2d 258 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        $250,000 cash bail set by trial court in sexual assault case was excessive where evidence was that defendant was a lifelong resident of Vermont, had a wife and four children living in the state, had been employed by the same company for seventeen years and was the sole source of income of his family. State v. Cardinal, 147 Vt. 461, 520 A.2d 984 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Greater risk of nonappearance was present, and greater monetary condition of bail release was justified, where defendant originally charged with sexual assault was additionally charged with a felony and misdemeanor. State v. Cardinal, 147 Vt. 461, 520 A.2d 984 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant was charged in two informations with receipt of stolen property, following prior release without monetary bail on prior charge of receiving and aiding in the concealment of stolen property, and following revocation of nonmonetary bail for violation of condition of bail providing that he not subsequently be charged with a like offense, $15,000 surety or cash bail on the two charges of receiving stolen property was not excessive. State v. Brown, 136 Vt. 561, 396 A.2d 134 (1978).

       <p>
        Revocation of bail for breach of condition that defendant shall not be subject of a new charge of like nature for which, after hearing probable cause should be found, was not error. State v. Brown, 136 Vt. 561, 396 A.2d 134 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the discretion of the judicial officer, breach of a condition of bail does not inevitably require revocation of bail and may instead lead to imposition of more restrictive conditions. State v. Brown, 136 Vt. 561, 396 A.2d 134 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Breach of a condition of bail imposed for reasons other than likelihood of appearing for trial might bear convincingly on issue of likelihood of appearing for trail, and one in violation of the condition may have his bail revoked and be incarcerated. State v. Brown, 136 Vt. 561, 396 A.2d 134 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Condition of bail providing that defendant shall not be charged while on bail with an offense of like nature cannot be the cause of revocation of bail on an ex parte determination of probable cause on a subsequent like offense without giving defendant notice and an opportunity to contest the finds of probable cause. State v. Brown, 136 Vt. 561, 396 A.2d 134 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no error in revocation of bail upon finding that condition of release that defendant not be charged with a like offense had been violated, where defendant had four felony and to misdemeanor charges carrying total sentence of over 85 years pending against him, had been convicted of six crimes, including two escapes from custody and aggravated assault, and had failed to appear for motor vehicle violation proceedings five times.

       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in ordering forfeiture of cash bail on the basis of the breach of a condition prohibiting certain types of future criminal conduct, where state did not allege that defendant had failed to appear before court as required by original bail order.

         21. Denial of bail.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in declining to release defendant on bail, because while it did not explicitly tie its analysis to each of the bail factors, it clearly considered those factors and provided ample support for its decision not to release defendant. State v. Blodgett, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (June 11, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse its discretion when it denied defendant bail without considering the weakness of the State's case as it related to defendant's risk of flight because the factor of the evidence of guilt being great, coupled with a charge carrying a life sentence, provided an impetus for flight. State v. Lafayette, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (May 11, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in determining that the pretrial release of defendant without the imposition of bail would not reasonably mitigate the risk that he might flee from prosecution, given the seriousness of the charges, which included aggravated assault upon a law enforcement officer, the finding that defendant was mentally unstable, which was supported by the self-harm he had done and by his belief that police called to perform a wellness check on him would kill him, and his prior history of not complying with court orders and his conviction for failure to appear. State v. Rougeau, 209 Vt. 535, 209 A.3d 599 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in deciding to hold defendant, who was charged with second-degree murder, without bail after concluding that releasing her on bail with a condition that she stay with one of the proposed custodians would not sufficiently limit flight risk and risk to public safety. Defendant's mother-in-law was already supervising a probationer, whose probation might be affected if defendant moved in, and the mother-in-law's son had a criminal record; defendant's brother and his adult family members had criminal records and in the case of the family members did not testify as to their availability. State v. Shores, 204 Vt. 630, 168 A.3d 471 (May 4, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        In denying defendant bail, the trial court properly considered each of the factors regarding conditions of release and found that the charges of aggravated sexual assault were very serious, that no family members offered to supervise defendant, that defendant was mostly unemployed, that a number of family members testified at his first trial that he was not honest or trustworthy, that he had threatened to kill the victim, and that the evidence of guilt was great. State v. Rondeau, 204 Vt. 625, 167 A.3d 332 (Mar. 21, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court, having considered the statutory factors, did not err in denying bail when it found that defendant, a probationer, was not a flight risk, but expressed concern over his pattern of conduct and his potential risk to the public State v. Campbell, 198 Vt. 627, 100 A.3d 289 (mem.) (Nov. 7, 2014).

        Defendants who fit the statutory criteria of the statute regarding detention of a probationer following a charge of a violation have a statutory right to bail or release, and the conditions of that release should be determined by a consideration of the factors in the pretrial release statute.

       Definition.
    
    As used in this section, "home detention" means a program of confinement and supervision that restricts a defendant to a preapproved residence continuously, except for authorized absences, and is enforced by appropriate means of surveillance and electronic monitoring by the Department of Corrections. The court may authorize scheduled absences such as for work, school, or treatment. Any changes in the schedule shall be solely at the discretion of the Department of Corrections. A defendant who is on home detention shall remain in the custody of the Commissioner of Corrections with conditions set by the court.
      </li>
      <li id="t13p05c229s7554bol1b">
       Procedure.
    
    At the request of the court, the Department of Corrections, or the defendant, the status of a defendant who is detained pretrial in a correctional facility for inability to pay bail after bail has been set by the court may be reviewed by the court to determine whether the defendant is appropriate for home detention. The review shall be scheduled upon the court's receipt of a report from the Department determining that the proposed residence is suitable for the use of electronic monitoring. A defendant held without bail pursuant to section 7553 or 7553a of this title shall not be eligible for release to the Home Detention Program on or after June 1, 2018. At arraignment or after a hearing, the court may order that the defendant be released to the Home Detention Program, provided that the court finds placing the defendant on home detention will reasonably assure his or her appearance in court when required and the proposed residence is appropriate for home detention. In making such a determination, the court shall consider:
       <ol>
        <li id="t13p05c229s7554bol1b1">
         the nature of the offense with which the defendant is charged;

         the defendant's prior convictions, history of violence, medical and mental health needs, history of supervision, and risk of flight; and

        <li id="t13p05c229s7554bol1b3">
         any risk or undue burden to other persons who reside at the proposed residence or risk to third parties or to public safety that may result from such placement.

       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t13p05c229s7554bol1c">
       Failure to comply.
    
    The Department of Corrections may revoke a defendant's home detention status for an unauthorized absence or failure to comply with any other condition of the Program and shall return the defendant to a correctional facility.
      </li>
      <li id="t13p05c229s7554bol1d">

         1. Equivalent of home detention.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        "In custody," for purposes of credit towards service of a sentence, by judicial precedent created a rule under which the trial courts, in reviewing a convicted defendant's claim for credit, consider whether the individual's pretrial conditions of release were so restrictive as to be tantamount to either institutional confinement or home detention. State v. Byam, 205 Vt. 173, 172 A.3d 171 (June 9, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was not eligible for credit for his continuing release on modified conditions, which relegated him to his home but allowed him to travel to a cell-phone-reception area, attend appointments, and walk his dog, as he was allowed substantial freedom in movement at his discretion. Furthermore, the conditions were not the equivalent of home detention. State v. Kenvin, 195 Vt. 166, 87 A.3d 454 (2013).
       </p>

         2. Judicial discretion.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Pretrial home detention provision was meant to apply broadly to the incarcerated population, including defendants held without bail. Under the statute, the trial court still retains discretion, but it must be exercised in accordance with certain standards, although the Blackmer presumption language still applies, so that in essence the defendant has the burden to show that home detention should be ordered. State v. Whiteway, 196 Vt. 629, 95 A.3d 1004 (mem.) (2014).
       </p>

         3. Particular cases.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Given its finding that home detention would be inappropriate, the trial court properly denied electronic monitoring. State v. Ford, 200 Vt. 650, 130 A.3d 862 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        In denying defendant's motion for pretrial home detention, the trial court improperly considered the nature of the offense multiple times against defendant and gave no weight to defendant's prior convictions, history of violence, medical and mental health needs, history of supervision, and risk of flight, which tended to support home detention. Furthermore, it improperly grounded its decision on the way that the Department of Corrections had chosen to discharge its responsibilities under the program. State v. Whiteway, 196 Vt. 629, 95 A.3d 1004 (mem.) (2014).

         4. Risk to third parties.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Evidence supported the trial court's finding, in denying defendant's motion for home detention, that defendant would pose a risk to the woman present at the crime scene. The killing was alleged to be related to the breakup of defendant's romantic relationship with the victim; the other woman had recently begun living with the victim prior to the shooting; and defendant was alleged to have physically assaulted the woman at the scene of the crime, and had to be pulled away from her. State v. Whiteway, 196 Vt. 638, 96 A.3d 473 (mem.) (May 6, 2014).
       </p>

         5. Sufficiency of security.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In denying defendant's motion for home detention, the trial court did not err in considering the limitations in the home-detention program for the purpose of evaluating whether there would be sufficient security at the home to protect public safety and the safety of third persons and to manage any risk of flight. The trial court's finding that home detention would not provide adequate security was based not only on the security limitations inherent to the program, but also on its finding that defendant would pose an unacceptable risk to a third party. State v. Whiteway, 196 Vt. 638, 96 A.3d 473 (mem.) (May 6, 2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        In denying defendant's motion for home detention, the trial court in drawing a conclusion about the effectiveness of the home detention program - that the Department of Corrections did not have the ability to supervise individuals released on global positioning system monitors, and could not detect someone who might be absconding - was unsupported by any evidence in the record. State v. Dunn, 196 Vt. 467, 93 A.3d 1057 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is not improper for the trial court to consider acts occurring when a defendant was a minor in its analysis of the statutory factors for home detention. Thus, the trial court did not err in considering defendant's previous crimes, failures-to-appear, and violations of probation because they occurred when he was a minor. State v. Dunn, 196 Vt. 467, 93 A.3d 1057 (2014).

         6. Denial proper.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court properly declined to release defendant to the home detention program when it did not base its decision on the administration of the program, but methodically analyzed the three factors required by statute, considering evidence specific to defendant and the charges against him. State v. Boyer, 207 Vt. 651, 192 A.3d 1270 (mem.) (June 14, 2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a second-degree murder case, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion for home detention when the trial court did not base its denial on criticisms of the system's administration and when it did not solely rely on the nature of the charged offense, but instead weighed factors specific to defendant, including defendant's history of violence, her prior convictions, and the proposed residence's remoteness. State v. Shores, 205 Vt. 645 - , 179 A.3d 196 (mem.) (Oct. 13, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in denying defendant's application for home detention when it found the nature of the offense to be extremely serious, when defendant's prior convictions, risk of flight, and history of supervision while being held without bail did not favor home detention, and when it found that the risk factors supported home detention, but determined home detention could not adequately protect the public. State v. Blow, 201 Vt. 633, 135 A.3d 672 (mem.) (Dec. 21, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        When defendant was charged with attempted first-degree murder and kidnapping, the trial court properly denied home detention when it considered all three required factors and found the nature of the offense to be extremely dangerous and violent and the risk to third parties and public safety to be high. State v. Ford, 200 Vt. 650, 130 A.3d 862 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in denying a murder defendant's motion for pretrial home detention, as its conclusion that defendant's mental health needs posed a risk of nonappearance was reasonable, it considered the factors that supported defendant's release but ultimately found that his mental health needs and the risk of nonappearance outweighed these other factors, and its conclusion that it would be difficult to determine that defendant posed no further risk of violent behavior was reasonable. State v. Pelletier, 197 Vt. 644, 108 A.3d 221 (2014).

       <br />

     </h3>
     <p>
      The General Assembly finds:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t13p05c229s7555aol11">
       During the 1991-2 and the 1993-4 sessions, the General Assembly adopted Proposal 7, which proposed to amend section 40 of Chapter II of the Vermont Constitution to allow a judge to order a person charged with a felony involving an act of violence to be held without bail when the evidence of guilt is great and the court finds by clear and convincing evidence
       <ol type="A">
        <li id="t13p05c229s7555aol11A">
         that the person's release poses a substantial threat of physical violence to any person; and
        </li>
        <li id="t13p05c229s7555aol11B">
         that no condition of release will reasonably prevent the physical violence.
        </li>
       </ol>
      </li>
      <li id="t13p05c229s7555aol12">
       On November 8, 1994, the voters of the State of Vermont approved Proposal 7.
      </li>
      <li id="t13p05c229s7555aol13">
       On December 13, 1994, the Governor certified the amendment thereby making it effective on that date.
      </li>
      <li id="t13p05c229s7555aol14">
       As amended, section 40 of Chapter II of the Vermont Constitution provides that if a judge orders a person held without bail, that person is entitled to a review de novo by a single Justice of the Supreme Court forthwith.
      </li>
      <li id="t13p05c229s7555aol15">
       Given the unique nature of the trial court hearing which can result in the accused being denied bail, in passing Proposal 7, and its enabling legislation, H.589, the General Assembly intended to provide the accused with a second evidentiary hearing by a single Justice without regard to the record compiled before the trial court. However, in the case of
    
     State v. Madison,
    
    No. 95-046 (1995), the Vermont Supreme Court held that the term "review de novo" as it is used in section 40 of Chapter II of the Vermont Constitution and in H.589 does not require the single Justice to conduct a second evidentiary hearing and that the Legislature should have used the term "hearing de novo" if it intended a second, independent evidentiary hearing.
      </li>
      <li id="t13p05c229s7555aol16">
       Proposal 7 substantially increased the court's authority prior to trial and conviction to incarcerate persons accused of certain offenses. It was the intent of the General Assembly to balance this increased judicial authority with increased due process for the accused person. That increased due process was intended to be in the form of a new and independent evidentiary hearing.
      </li>
      <li id="t13p05c229s7555aol17">
       In certain respects, the Vermont Constitution is not a grant of power to the Legislature, but is a limitation on its general powers. Section 40(2) of Chapter II establishes the minimum required due process for an accused, but the General Assembly may require greater due process.
      </li>
      <li id="t13p05c229s7555aol18">
       It was the clear and unequivocal intent of the General Assembly that a person who is denied bail and is incarcerated prior to trial under the authority of section 40(2) of Chapter II be entitled to a second full evidentiary hearing by a single Justice.
      </li>
      <li id="t13p05c229s7555aol19">
       In order to implement the intent of the General Assembly, subsection 7556(d) of this title is amended to make it clear and unequivocal that a person who is denied bail under the authority of section 40(2) of Chapter II is entitled to a second full evidentiary hearing by a single Justice. Such a hearing is intended to be in addition to but not in conflict with the constitutionally required minimum due process established by Proposal 7.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Defendant's bail appeal could be reviewed by a three-judge panel, as the merits of the initial hold-without-bail determination were not disputed, the trial court had rejected a motion to modify or terminate that order on purely legal grounds, without taking evidence or exercising discretion, and the issue on appeal was a pure question of law. State v. White, - Vt.
    - , 237 A.3d 1235 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the court's decision that defendant had no right to bail would answer his appeal of the court's denial of his motion to dismiss, the court could not address this aspect of the trial court's decision in any case. Its jurisdiction was provided by the statute governing appeal from conditions of release and authorized only the review of the trial court's determination to hold defendant without bail. State v. Hardy, 184 Vt. 618, 965 A.2d 478 (mem.) (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section did not authorize single justice review of bail determination, where appellant was a material witness in a criminal proceeding, not a defendant. State v. Ely, 168 Vt. 614, 724 A.2d 443 (mem.) (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although petitioners denied bail by district court were not entitled to habeas corpus relief in superior court because superior court did not conclude that a bail appeal pursuant to this section was unavailable, in the interests of justice, Supreme Court would treat petitioners' appeal from the superior court order as also having been taken from the district court order. Unnamed Prisoners v. Maranville, 154 Vt. 279, 576 A.2d 132 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        In bail appeal in which defendant, who was charged with an offense punishable by life imprisonment, challenged the trial court's reliance on evidence subject of a motion to suppress, remand was required for trial court's consideration of whether state could make a prima facie showing the challenged evidence would be admissible at trial. State v. Passino, 154 Vt. 377, 577 A.2d 281 (1990).

      When a District or Superior court postpones the trial of a criminal case or the examination of a person charged with a criminal offense, the court may impose the least restrictive conditions or combination of conditions permitted under subdivision 7554(a)(1) of this title which will reasonably assure the person's appearance before the court on the day to which the trial or examination is postponed.

        "In connection with a prosecution" should be read naturally and plainly to restrict subsec. 7559(d) to a subset of 7554 conditions specifying the time and place of appearances, such as court appearances, that directly advance a prosecution. In re Miller, 185 Vt. 550, 975 A.2d 1226 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        The legislative history of subsecs. (d) and (e) of the statute pertaining to release on bond conclusively demonstrates that the legislature intended for subsec. (d) to apply to appearances at court proceedings and for subsec. (e) to apply to all other conditions of release. In re Miller, 185 Vt. 550, 975 A.2d 1226 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not provide a basis for holding a defendant without bail independent from that already contained in the statute governing release prior to trial. Rather, the section requires the court to re-evaluate the conditions in place in connection with the underlying conviction upon prosecution under the section. State v. Winn, 184 Vt. 639, 964 A.2d 1178 (mem.) (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jurisdiction of judge in taking recognizance is statutory and special and exists only in the cases named in the statute. State v. Lamoine, 53 Vt. 568 (1881), criticized in State v. Shaw (1901) 73 Vt. 149, 50 A. 863.

        Although a capias only commands sheriff to arrest respondent and forthwith have him before court, respondent after arrest remains in custody of sheriff until he has bail, and if he has no bail sheriff may commit him to jail upon the capias. State v. Shaw, 73 Vt. 149, 50 A. 863 (1901), criticizing State v. Lamoine (1881) 53 Vt. 568.

       <p>
        When one is convicted of a crime by justice and appeals, and in default of security for his appeal is committed to jail and is then bailed, but his recognizance is conditioned only for his appearance at court, and not that he will prosecute his appeal to effect, no action can be sustained on the recognizance if case has never been entered in county court.

       <p>
        Convictions of defendant for attempted felony violation of a relief from abuse order by following or stalking the victim, and contempt for violating his condition of release by coming within 100 feet of the victim or her vehicle, did not violate double jeopardy.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Although the purpose of reporting to a police station every morning may be to ensure eventual appearance in court, failure to appear at the station is punishable under subsec. (e) of the statute regarding release on bond while failure to appear in court is punishable under subsec. (d). In re Miller, 185 Vt. 550, 975 A.2d 1226 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsec. (d) of the statute regarding release on bond punishes failures to appear in court - or at other proceedings that directly advance a pending prosecution - severely, and subsec. (e) imposes lesser sanctions for violations of conditions of release restricting travel or harassment of victims or witnesses. In re Miller, 185 Vt. 550, 975 A.2d 1226 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was uncontested that petitioner never missed an appearance at court, but only failed to comply with the requirement that he check in daily at a certain police station; he was therefore properly chargeable only under subsec. (e) of the statute regarding release on bond. Thus, because his failure to appear at the police station could not establish the elements of the offense under subsec. (d), his guilty pleas under that subsec. were not voluntary. In re Miller, 185 Vt. 550, 975 A.2d 1226 (2009).

         1. Purpose of forfeiture.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Forfeiture of bail exists not as a punitive tool, but rather to assure that the defendant will appear at court when required. Therefore, bail may not be forfeited for breach of conditions other than appearance because doing so transforms monetary bail from a guarantor of appearance into a potentially punitive tool useful in the enforcement of all bail conditions. State v. Brown, 179 Vt. 22, 890 A.2d 79 (August 26, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the court's policy of non-transport for incarcerated defendants applied, bail forfeiture was erroneous because defendant did not fail to appear at a proceeding where his presence was required. State v. Brown, 179 Vt. 22, 890 A.2d 79 (August 26, 2005).

         2. Reduction in forfeiture.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Surety was entitled to a reduction in bail forfeiture. Defendant's failure to appear due to his out-of-state incarceration was not willful in that his incarceration did not result from fleeing the jurisdiction; the surety attempted to use available procedures to retrieve defendant; the prejudice suffered by the State was minimal in that it amounted to a short delay in trial proceedings and the expenses associated with extradition; and any forfeiture amount above the costs associated with extradition and delayed trial would serve only to punish the surety, a result the court had long proscribed. State v. Mottolese, 199 Vt. 470, 124 A.3d 809 (2015).

         3. Hearing.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        When the surety alleged that it had told the trial court that defendant was engaged in rehabilitation and was told by court staff that the forfeiture hearing would not go forward and that it did not receive notice of the forfeiture order giving it ten days before forfeiture would become effective, the trial court erred in forfeiting bail without holding a hearing and resolving the surety's factual allegations. Without resolving these allegations, the trial court lacked the relevant information to evaluate all the relevant factors and make its decision. State v. Anderson, 204 Vt. 17, 162 A.3d 1249 (Dec. 9, 2016).

      If a surety or a person who has posted bail wishes to surrender the principal in discharge of the person's obligations under the bond or bail agreement, the person may apply in writing to a judicial officer, as defined in subsection 7554(f) of this title, for a warrant to apprehend and detain the principal. The court shall, absent good cause shown, thereupon issue such warrant, and on detention of the principal, the person's obligation under the bond or bail agreement shall be discharged.

        Where surety did not file an application for a warrant until after defendant had failed to appear and had been arrested in another state, at that point, it was plainly too late to invoke this section because defendant had already violated the appearance condition of his bail thus the bail was subject to forfeiture.

        Surrender of respondent in discharge of his bail in a court of record of general jurisdiction, and a docket entry of such proceeding made under direction of court, carry with them, in intendment of the law, authority from the court to its officer to have respondent in custody and if he has not new bail to commit him to jail; and
        §§
        7560 and 7561 of this title have no application when respondent is surrendered in court in discharge of bail without a bail warrant as provided in those sections, nor when respondent surrenders himself in court and procures discharge of his bail, nor when a person on trial for felony is ordered into custody under

       <br />
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A surety may file a motion requesting the return of forfeited bail, bond or any other security at any time after the order of forfeiture is entered. The court shall set the motion for hearing and provide notice thereof to the surety and the state's attorney. If the court finds the interests of justice would be served by returning all or part of the security, the court may grant the motion and return as much of the security as it deems equitable under the circumstances.

       <p>
        Where defendant was granted bail, failed to show in court for jury drawing, bail was forfeited, defendant appeared of his own will some 10 months later, court made no further order concerning bail, but ordered defendant could be released on certain conditions, defendant pleaded guilty, and his motion for return of bail was denied, bail forfeiture would be upheld where no abuse of discretion was shown.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Surety was entitled to a reduction in bail forfeiture. Defendant's failure to appear due to his out-of-state incarceration was not willful in that his incarceration did not result from fleeing the jurisdiction; the surety attempted to use available procedures to retrieve defendant; the prejudice suffered by the State was minimal in that it amounted to a short delay in trial proceedings and the expenses associated with extradition; and any forfeiture amount above the costs associated with extradition and delayed trial would serve only to punish the surety, a result the court had long proscribed. State v. Mottolese, 199 Vt. 470, 124 A.3d 809 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        The burden of establishing a justification for the remission of forfeiture of bail rests with the person on bail. State v. Hutchins, 134 Vt. 441, 365 A.2d 507 (1976).

       <p>
        A decision on whether to remit forfeiture of bail is wholly discretionary with the trial court and its ruling is not subject to review unless it clearly and affirmatively appears that such discretion has been abused or withheld; and the test for abuse is failure to exercise discretion or an exercise of it on grounds or for reasons clearly untenable or to an extent clearly unreasonable.

         1. Purpose.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The statutory provisions providing for revocation of bail if defendant intimidates or harasses a victim or witness, or violates a condition of release which constitutes a threat to the integrity of the judicial system, are both based on the compelling state interest in prosecuting those accused of violating its laws. State v. Sauve, 159 Vt. 566, 621 A.2d 1296 (1993).
       </p>

         2. Construction.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in denying bail to domestic abuse defendant on ground that his conduct constituted threat to integrity of judicial system; threats to well-being of victim, however real and proximate to her, were too remote and attenuated from integrity of criminal proceedings to dictate so sweeping a response as denial of right to bail. State v. Fales, 157 Vt. 652, 599 A.2d 1046 (mem.) (1991).

         3. Findings.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In a bail revocation proceeding, the trial court properly rejected the alternative of placing defendant with his mother, as she was his codefendant. State v. Brooks, 196 Vt. 604, - A.3d - (mem.) (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Order denying release on bail was inadequate under the statute governing revocation of the right to bail because the trial court had not found that defendant repeatedly violated conditions of release or a condition falling under the first, third, fourth, or fifth sections of the statute; moreover, the trial court had not addressed the requirements that the State prove violations by a preponderance of the evidence and that there be a nexus between such violations and a disruption of the prosecution to hold without bail under the second section of the statute. The single violation of a curfew condition alleged here, no matter how clear the condition was, could not, without more, support revocation of the right to bail under the statute. State v. Winn, 184 Vt. 639, 964 A.2d 1178 (mem.) (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Finding that complaining witness was in danger of contact by the defendant was insufficient to support revocation of bail; statutory provisions required finding either that witness was harassed and intimidated, or that witness refused to testify or feared reprisal. State v. Sauve, 159 Vt. 566, 621 A.2d 1296 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        In bail revocation proceedings, the court must look, not just at the strength of the state's case, but also at contrary evidence, and is required to exercise its discretion by weighing the evidence. State v. Sauve, 159 Vt. 566, 621 A.2d 1296 (1993).
       </p>

         4. Violation of conditions.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Provision allowing revocation of bail due to the commission of a felony or a crime against a person is subject to the same constitutional analysis as the provision related to the repeated violation of the conditions of release, and the Vermont Constitution provision does not have an exception for multiple charges; if the statutory elements were sufficient, a second qualifying charge for which probable cause is found would virtually always allow for revocation of conditions of release even though the second charge is for a bailable offense because the condition that defendant not be charged with a crime for which probable cause is found is a standard condition virtually always imposed. State v. Gates, 201 Vt. 502, 145 A.3d 233 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Superior Court erred by revoking defendant's bail due to repeated violations of the conditions of release because the findings were insufficient to show a violation of the statute authorizing bail revocation since there was no showing that the victim feared reprisal for her testimony, there was no finding of a nexus between the violations and a disruption of prosecution, the repeated violations alone were not sufficient to meet the standard under the Vermont Constitution, the State did not prove by a preponderance of the evidence that defendant committed the crime of obstruction of justice, and it was not enough to just meet the statutory elements for a felony or a crime against persons. State v. Gates, 201 Vt. 502, 145 A.3d 233 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to support revocation of bail based on his intimidating or harassing the alleged victim in violation of a condition of release. Defendant drove past the alleged victim's current residence and other Charlestown locales where she might be found, with no other reason to be in Charlestown, and the record included testimony that seeing defendant caused the alleged victim to shake and cry. State v. Deyo, 196 Vt. 606, - A.3d - (mem.) (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        By threatening a minor who had accused him of sexual assault, defendant had violated the condition of release which restricted him from contacting minors and threatened the integrity of the judicial system, even though the minor was not involved in the kidnapping case for which the condition had been set. State v. Brooks, 196 Vt. 604, - A.3d - (mem.) (2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's assault on his wife in direct violation of a temporary relief from abuse order, several earlier incidents of physical assault and harassment, and restraining her against her will and threatening her life with a loaded handgun supported felony charges of aggravated domestic assault and first degree unlawful restraint and also supported revocation of bail. State v. Plant, 165 Vt. 617, 686 A.2d 941 (mem.) (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to have bail revoked, the state must prove that defendant violated conditions of release by a preponderance of the evidence. State v. Sauve, 159 Vt. 566, 621 A.2d 1296 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Repeatedly violating conditions of release, without more, does not rise to the level of a compelling interest sufficient to justify revocation of bail. State v. Sauve, 159 Vt. 566, 621 A.2d 1296 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Withholding bail for repeatedly violating conditions of release is unconstitutional unless there is a nexus between the repeated violations and a disruption of the prosecution. State v. Sauve, 159 Vt. 566, 621 A.2d 1296 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        State's evidence did not fairly and reasonably tend to show defendant's guilt on charge of violation of a condition of his release when defendant was still in custody at the time the alleged violation occurred. State v. Ashley, 161 Vt. 65, 632 A.2d 1368 (1993).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Requirement for hearing under subsec. (5) of this section could not be satisfied by finding pursuant to criminal rule governing probable cause determination, and matter was remanded for evidentiary hearing on question of probable cause. State v. Huseboe, 158 Vt. 651, 607 A.2d 1140 (mem.) (1992).

         7. Alternatives to revocation.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in not taking less restrictive steps than revoking bail, as the statute did not require the trial court to attempt any intermediate steps before revoking bail. State v. Deyo, 196 Vt. 606, - A.3d - (mem.) (2003).

         8. After-hours bail.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Given the temporary nature of an after-hours bail order, a trial court can hold a defendant without bail following an initial appearance even though the prior after-hours order set conditions of release, including bail. Thus, the fact that the trial court had set after-hours bail when defendant was arrested did not require the trial court to revoke defendant's bail in order to impose a hold-without-bail order at his initial appearance. State v. Morton, 207 Vt. 623, 184 A.3d 249 (mem.) (Feb. 21, 2018).

       2019 No. 167 (Adj. Sess.),
       §
       31 provides: "(a) As used in this section:
      </p>
      <p>
       "(1) "Court" means the Criminal Division of the Superior Court.
      </p>
      <p>

       "(b) The court shall order the expungement of criminal history records of violations of 18 V.S.A.
       §
       4230(a)(1) that occurred prior to January 1, 2021. The process for expunging these records shall be completed by the court and all entities subject to the order not later than January 1, 2022.

       "(c) Upon entry of an expungement order, the order shall be legally effective immediately and the person whose record is expunged shall be treated in all respects as if he or she had never been arrested, convicted, or sentenced for the offense. The court shall issue an order to expunge all records and files related to the arrest, citation, investigation, charge, adjudication of guilt, criminal proceedings, and probation related to the sentence. The court shall issue the person a certificate stating that the offense for which the person was convicted has been decriminalized and therefore warrants issuance of the order and that its effect is to annul the record of arrest, conviction, and sentence. The court shall provide notice of the expungement to the person who is the subject of the record at the person's last known address, the Vermont Crime Information Center (VCIC), the arresting agency, and any other entity that may have a record related to the order to expunge. The VCIC shall provide notice of the expungement to the Federal Bureau of Investigation's National Crime Information Center.

       "(1) shall not be required to acknowledge the existence of such a criminal history record or answer questions about the record in any application for employment, license, or civil right or privilege or in an appearance as a witness in any proceeding or hearing;
      </p>
      <p>
       "(2) may deny the existence of the record regardless of whether the person has received notice from the court that an expungement order has been issued on the person's behalf; and
      </p>
      <p>
       "(3) may utilize the procedures in chapter 230 of Title 13 to seek expungement or sealing of the record prior to the court taking steps to issue an expungement order pursuant to this section.

      <p>
       "(e) Nothing in this section shall affect any right of the person whose record has been expunged to rely on it as a bar to any subsequent proceedings for the same offense.

      <p>
       "(f)(1) The court shall keep a special index of cases that have been expunged together with the expungement order and the certificate issued pursuant to this chapter. The index shall list only the name of the person convicted of the offense, his or her date of birth, the docket number, and the criminal offense that was the subject of the expungement.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(2) The special index and related documents specified in subdivision (1) of this subsection shall be confidential and shall be physically and electronically segregated in a manner that ensures confidentiality and that limits access to authorized persons.

      <p>
       "(3) Inspection of the expungement order and the certificate may be permitted only upon petition by the person who is the subject of the case.

       §
       7606 in implementing this section.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Conditions for expungement when "the person was convicted of an offense for which the underlying conduct is no longer prohibited by law or designated as a criminal offense" are contained in clauses that follow the negative adverb phrase, "no longer." Thus, expungement is available only when the underlying conduct is both no longer prohibited by law and no longer designated as a criminal offense. State v. Turner, - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (Apr. 30, 2021).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because for the period in question, absconding from furlough was decriminalized but was still prohibited by law, allowing the State to arrest and return to a correctional facility those who violated the law, petitioner was not entitled to expungement of his escape convictions under the provision allowing expungement when "the person was convicted of an offense for which the underlying conduct is no longer prohibited by law or designated as a criminal offense."

        Although generally expungement petitions filed under the provision allowing expungement when "the person was convicted of an offense for which the underlying conduct is no longer prohibited by law or designated as a criminal offense" require a showing that the offense in question is both no longer criminalized and no longer unlawful, petitions seeking expungement of offenses for possessing regulated drugs need show only that the offense has been either decriminalized or made lawful.
