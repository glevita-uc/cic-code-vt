       <p>
        Since the Vermont Code forbids an application of the default date of the statute concerning the effective date of laws to frustrate plain legislative intent, and since the court is to effectuate that intent, the Legislature's repeal of the sunset provision of the attorney's fees provision of the Prompt Pay Act must be read as taking effect before any unintended nullification by default. Accordingly, the attorney's fees provision continued in effect after June 30, 1996. First Quality Carpets, Inc. v. Kirschbaum, 192 Vt. 28, 54 A.3d 465 (2012).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Joint authority statute applies unless the construction is inconsistent with the manifest intent of the Legislature or repugnant to the context of the same statute; the Human Services Board statute states that a quorum of the Board is normally four persons. Since the quorum requirement is a different concept from a requirement that there be a specific number of votes to render a decision, the application of the joint authority statute to the case decisions of the Human Services Board is not inconsistent with the manifest intent of the Legislature or repugnant to the context of the statute. In re Rumsey, 192 Vt. 290, 59 A.3d 730 (2012).

        Breault v. Department of Social Welfare,
        135 Vt. 41, 369 A.2d 1377 (1977), does not reference the joint authority statute, but relies upon a rule of the Human Services Board. The opinion is inconsistent with the statute, and to the extent it is applicable today, it is overruled. In re Rumsey, 192 Vt. 290, 59 A.3d 730 (2012).

       <p>
        "Concurrence" under voting statute meant more than silent acquiescence; it required expressed assent through a vote for the proposition, and thus planning commission's approval of subdivision amendment was properly reversed since abstention by one commission member could not count as acquiescence with majority of members who voted. In re Reynolds, 170 Vt. 352, 749 A.2d 1133 (2000).

        "Concurrence," as used in this section, involves physical presence, not merely a state of mind, plus an expressed assent. State v. Vermont Emergency Board, 136 Vt. 506, 394 A.2d 1360 (1978).

        There is nothing in the statutory procedures governing the New Motor Vehicle Arbitration Board to suggest that 1 V.S.A.
        §
        172, which requires that a majority of the members of an administrative board must vote for a result for the vote to be effective, does not apply to it; thus, where a majority of the arbitration board had not voted for a result, the only feasible remedy on appeal was to require a rehearing of the evidence. In re Villeneuve, 167 Vt. 450, 709 A.2d 1067 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Planning commission bylaw allowing action by majority of commissioners "present and voting" was invalid, since 24 V.S.A.
        §
        4323(b) did not authorize commission to override rule expressed in this section. In re Lionni, 160 Vt. 625, 648 A.2d 832 (mem.) (1993).

        Action by board of selectmen must be by a majority of the members. State v. Baldwin, 116 Vt. 112, 70 A.2d 242 (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        At common law, as well as under this section, the certificate of two commissioners, the third having shared in their deliberations but refusing to concur in their decision, is conclusive evidence of the facts therein stated. First National Bank of North Bennington v. Town of Mount Tabor, 52 Vt. 87 (1879).
       </p>
       <p>
        As the duty of signing bonds was imposed on selectmen in their official capacity, and as act of a majority of the selectmen would be as valid as act of the whole board, bonds signed by two of town's three selectmen were duly executed. First National Bank of St. Johnsbury v. Town of Concord, 50 Vt. 257 (1877).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not change the rule of common law and if, in a matter of public trust, or of power conferred for public purposes, all meet, the act of the majority will bind. Hodges v. Thacher, 23 Vt. 455 (1851).

        Decisions made not in compliance with the joint authority statute represent inaction, not action, as long as adding the votes of any members who could have but did not vote and who are not abstaining could produce a complying result, i.e., a majority of the Board. A board has not acted so long as the Appellate Court is, so to speak, waiting on a potentially outcome-affecting vote. In re Rumsey, 192 Vt. 290, 59 A.3d 730 (2012).

       <p>
        Human Services Board's tie vote constituted inaction and required remand when six members of the Board voted on petitioner's appeal because one member did not make it to the meeting where the vote was taken. The seventh member was not disqualified from the case and did not abstain from considering it. In re Rumsey, 192 Vt. 290, 59 A.3d 730 (2012).

       § 174. Notice by publication.
       <br/>
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      When a notice is required to be given by publication in a newspaper, it shall mean a newspaper published in the county where the subject matter is situated, pending or to be heard, or a newspaper published within the State which has a general circulation.
    In any case, in its discretion, the court may cause such notice to be further published in a newspaper which circulates in the neighborhood of the persons interested. Whenever a notice of any kind is required to be given by publication in a newspaper prior to a certain date for a certain number of weeks successively, it may be given by an insertion prior to such date once a week, for the number of successive weeks required, either in a daily, semiweekly, or weekly newspaper.
    If such publication is in a daily or semiweekly newspaper, such notice shall be inserted on the same day of each successive week.

        July 1 default date of the statute concerning the effective date of laws cannot apply to invalidate the Legislature's intent to accomplish exactly the opposite as expressed in its repeal of the sunset provision of the attorney's fees provision of the Prompt Pay Act; nor does the statutory prohibition against ex post facto reanimation of expired legislation apply to the alteration of a statute if passed before the affected statute has expired, as with the Legislature's repeal of the sunset provision. Thus, in accordance with the Legislature's explicit and undisputed intention, the attorney's fees provision of the Prompt Pay Act remained in effect after June 30, 1996. First Quality Carpets, Inc. v. Kirschbaum, 192 Vt. 28, 54 A.3d 465 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the Vermont Code forbids an application of the default date of the statute concerning the effective date of laws to frustrate plain legislative intent, and since the Court is to effectuate that intent, the Legislature's repeal of the sunset provision of the attorney's fees provision of the Prompt Pay Act must be read as taking effect before any unintended nullification by default. Accordingly, the attorney's fees provision continued in effect after June 30, 1996. First Quality Carpets, Inc. v. Kirschbaum, 192 Vt. 28, 54 A.3d 465 (2012).

        Evidence of passenger's failure to wear safety belt at time of motor vehicle accident was properly excluded, since provisions of safety belt statute prohibiting introduction of evidence of noncompliance with statute were procedural rather than substantive in nature, and thus those provisions applied notwithstanding fact that passenger's personal injury action was pending at time safety belt statute became effective.

        It is provided by statute that acts of the General Assembly, except those regulating practice in court, relating to the competency of witnesses or to amendments of process or pleadings, shall not affect a suit begun or pending at the time of their passage. Just as this provision protects applicants from newly adopted ordinances, regulations, or laws unfavorable to an already-submitted permit application, so too it prevents an applicant for an Act 250 permit from selectively taking advantage of favorable changes in the law on reconsideration, which is merely the continuation of the original permit application.

        When petitioner filed his postconviction relief (PCR) petition in 2001, he had an unconditional right to representation under the then-existing version of the statute regarding the representation of postconviction relief petitioners. Under the statute regarding the effect of a statutory amendment, his right to representation under the former PCR statute remained vested after the statute was amended in 2004; thus, petitioner did not lose his right to appointed counsel when his attorney withdrew based on his determination that the PCR petition no longer raised nonfrivolous bases for relief. In re Crannell, 192 Vt. 406, 60 A.3d 632 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        July 1 default date of the statute concerning the effective date of laws cannot apply to invalidate the Legislature's intent to accomplish exactly the opposite as expressed in its repeal of the sunset provision of the attorney's fees provision of the Prompt Pay Act; nor does the statutory prohibition against ex post facto reanimation of expired legislation apply to the alteration of a statute if passed before the affected statute has expired, as with the Legislature's repeal of the sunset provision. Thus, in accordance with the Legislature's explicit and undisputed intention, the attorney's fees provision of the Prompt Pay Act remained in effect after June 30, 1996. First Quality Carpets, Inc. v. Kirschbaum, 191 Vt. 28, 54 A.3d 465 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the Legislature enacted its repeal of the sunset provision of the attorney's fees provision of the Prompt Pay Act on April 6, 1996, before the sunset provision went into effect, the statute regarding the effect of amendment or repeal did not apply. First Quality Carpets, Inc. v. Kirschbaum, 191 Vt. 28, 54 A.3d 465 (2012).

       <p>
        Deadlines listed in the statute dealing with challenging placement on the child abuse registry are solely procedural and therefore fall under a general exception to the statute that deals with an amendment's retroactive effects on substantive rights. Furthermore, the deadlines in the registry statute were not in fact being applied retroactively, since petitioner had no appellate rights in the case until the date the charge was substantiated at which point the amendment adding the deadlines was already in effect. In re Beer, 187 Vt. 641, 996 A.2d 225 (mem.) (2010).

        Given that Vermont law specifically recognizes that when the Legislature reduces a penalty provision in a statute, the lighter penalty will be imposed for any action that has not reached final judgment, 1990 amendment to 8 V.S.A.
        §
        2233, penalty provision covering licensed lenders, was properly applied

        Because a "liability" of a reimbursable employer was established at the point of an employee making a valid claim for unemployment compensation benefits, such liability was not changed by the amendment to the reimbursement statute as to an employee's gross misconduct.

       <p>
        Defendant failed in his argument that a post-conviction amendment to Vermont's stalking statute mandated that he receive a new trial because, aside from defendant's mere assertion that clarifying amendments are procedural per se, this suggested exception to the statutory provision on the retroactive effect of statutory amendments is unsupported by statutes or case law and the court declined to adopt it. State v. Van Aelstyn, 181 Vt. 274, 917 A.2d 471 (January 12, 2007), cert. denied, 128 S. Ct. 68, 2007 U.S. LEXIS 10280, 169 L. Ed. 2d 17 (U.S. 2007).

        Repeal of criminal statute is not an amendment for purposes of subsection (c) of this section. State v. Lapan, 158 Vt. 382, 609 A.2d 970 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Retroactive application of new statutory law is normally prohibited by subsection (b) of this section. State v. Willis, 145 Vt. 459, 494 A.2d 108 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (b) of this section, providing that statutory changes will not generally be given retroactive application, does not prevent supreme court from overruling judge-made law and applying any new rule it decides to adopt in place of the pre-existing rule. Cavanaugh v. Abbott Laboratories, 145 Vt. 516, 496 A.2d 154 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section statutory rights and penalties are determined by the statute in effect at the time of the occurrence of the facts and may be enforced after repeal or amendment if the underlying facts are proved. State v. Matthews, 131 Vt. 521, 310 A.2d 17 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Criminal penalty is "incurred," as that word is used in subdivision (b)(3) of this section, when a criminal act is committed. State v. Matthews, 131 Vt. 521, 310 A.2d 17 (1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsection (c) of this section relates only where the penalty or punishment for any offense is reduced by the amendment of any act or statutory provision, and not to a repealed statute. State v. Matthews, 131 Vt. 521, 310 A.2d 17 (1973).

       <p>
        Decriminalization of an offense does not preclude application of an ameliorative amendment clause where offending conduct still carries a civil penalty. State v. Flagg, 160 Vt. 141, 624 A.2d 864 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        To decide whether the penalty or punishment for an offense is reduced by an amendment, the court must determine whether the new enactment carries forward the essential provisions of the old statute, preserving its viability, and whether the new enactment expresses the legislative intent to continue to treat the conduct as culpable conduct, warranting punishment. State v. Flagg, 160 Vt. 141, 624 A.2d 864 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that a new enactment accomplishes more than a mere reduction of punishment, in that it reclassifies an offense as a civil violation, does not affect its character as a legislative mitigation of punishment. State v. Flagg, 160 Vt. 141, 624 A.2d 864 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Change in law that reclassified as a civil violation, rather than a criminal offense, the operation of a motor vehicle with a suspended license after suspension period had expired and prior to reinstatement was applied retroactively since the change did not remove all liability for violative conduct. State v. Flagg, 160 Vt. 141, 624 A.2d 864 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        In absence of amendment to criminal statute, legislative intent of subsection (c) of this section is to preserve right of prosecution and sentence and not to exculpate defendant by reason of repeal of criminal statute. State v. Lapan, 158 Vt. 382, 609 A.2d 970 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sentence in excess of five years and $10,000 fine imposed in prosecution for dispensing regulated drug was proper, even though penalty statute and enhancement section were repealed prior to sentencing and replaced with provisions lacking enhancement section, since changes were not amendments for purposes of subsection (c) of this section and even if they had been, new enhancement provision would not have diminished sentence imposed. State v. Lapan, 158 Vt. 382, 609 A.2d 970 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section evidences a legislative intent to continue criminal responsibility and penalty attaching to forbidden conduct, even though the criminal statute violated is repealed. State v. Matthews, 131 Vt. 521, 310 A.2d 17 (1973).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Where three-year statute of limitation for crime of sexual assault had not run at time legislature extended limitation period from three to six years, defendant did not acquire at time of alleged offense a right to original limitation period, and six-year statute of limitation was retroactively applicable. State v. Petrucelli, 156 Vt. 382, 592 A.2d 365 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subdivision (b)(4) of this section, which forbids any retroactive application that would affect any suit, remedy or proceeding to enforce any right or liability accrued under the amended or repealed provision, collapses the common law distinction between "rights" and "remedies" in regard to retroactivity of limitations statutes, and limits amendments affecting both a "right" and the scope of the "remedy" available when the cause of action accrues to prospective application. Stewart v. Darrow, 141 Vt. 248, 448 A.2d 788 (1982).

        The 1982 amendment to section 1403 of Title 29, allowing suits against the state to the extent the state purchased liability insurance, should not be applied retroactively where the legislature included no retroactivity provision in its amendment and no strong ground was presented for overcoming the effect of subdivision (b)(2) providing that an amendment should not affect a right or liability previously accrued or incurred.

       <p>
        There was no need under the "saving clause" statute to exclude a 1989 sexual assault conviction in determining whether defendant was a habitual offender. The sentence was imposed prior to the date of the amendment of the sexual assault statute; furthermore, the statute applied to a reduction in the statutory punishment, whereas here there was no reduction in punishment but instead a redefinition of the required ages of the defendant and the victim. State v. Barron, 189 Vt. 193, 16 A.3d 620 (2011).

       <p>
        While taxation of costs, eo nomine, was unknown at common law, by the Statute of Gloucester, 6 Edw. I, costs were allowed a successful plaintiff in real actions, and by later statutes in all actions, and the same right was given a successful defendant by 23 Hen. VIII and subsequent amendments, and as our statute of 1779, adopting "the common law as it is generally practiced and understood in the New England States," adopted the common law of England as altered by statutes in force October 1, 1760, the date arbitrarily selected as the date to which our statute related, the usual statement that "it is only by force of our statutes that costs are ever taxed and allowed" would be less confusing if it recited that it is only by force of our statutes that costs are taxed and allowed in cases where they were not allowed by the law of England in force October 1, 1760. Comstock's Admr. v. Jacobs, 89 Vt. 510, 96 A. 4 (1915).
       </p>
       <p>
        The statute of 1782, adopting common law of England, was largely declaratory of the common law as here practiced and understood, and the various subsequent changes in the wording of the statute were not intended to work a change in the law itself. Clement v. Graham, 78 Vt. 290, 63 A. 146 (1906).

       <p>
        Common law adopted in Vermont is rule of decision in all courts, by which is meant that such common law is law of state, and is to be administered as such by its courts; and, except as modified or repealed by statute, its rules and principles determine rights of, and prescribe rules of conduct for, all persons. E. B. & A. C. Whiting Co. v. City of Burlington, 106 Vt. 446, 175 A. 35 (1934).

        Under this section English decisions before the date of separation, as well as those after, are to be taken merely as declarative of the common law, and not as binding precedents to be blindly followed. In re Heaton's Estate, 89 Vt. 550, 96 A. 21 (1915).

        The common law is changed by statute only if the statute overturns the common law in clear and unambiguous language, or if the statute is clearly inconsistent with the common law, or the statute attempts to cover the entire subject matter. Langle v. Kurkul, 146 Vt. 513, 510 A.2d 1301 (1986).

        A statute does not change common law by doubtful implication; it is only overturned by clear and unambiguous language. State v. Brown, 147 Vt. 324, 515 A.2d 1059 (1986).

        Though constitution of Vermont contains no provision similar to eighth amendment to federal constitution, prohibiting excessive fines and cruel and unusual punishments, common law of England, which had similar provision, was adopted by this section. State v. O'Brien, 106 Vt. 97, 170 A. 98 (1934).
       </p>
       <p>
        Punishment for misdemeanor at common law, when law had not provided some other specific penalty, was fine and imprisonment, or either, at discretion of court, and that is law of Vermont. State v. Coolidge, 106 Vt. 183, 171 A. 244 (1934).

        A combination of two or more persons to constrain an employer to discharge a particular workman by threatening to prevent his obtaining other workmen, or to constrain a workman to join a certain organization by threatening to prevent him from obtaining work unless he does so is a criminal conspiracy at common law.

        As an instrumentality of state, University of Vermont falls within plain meaning of term "public body" under subdivision (3) of this section. Animal Legal Defense Fund, Inc. v. Institutional Animal Care & Use Committee, 159 Vt. 133, 616 A.2d 224 (1992).

        There is no dispute that district commissions are public agencies that act in a quasi-judicial capacity, as the commissions hear evidence and issue rulings in the manner of a court, and their decisions are subject to review by the Environmental Division of the Superior Court. Their work satisfies an ordinary understanding of the term "quasi-judicial" for purposes of the exemption from disclosure for "records of, or internal materials prepared for, the deliberations of any public agency acting in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity," and it is also consistent with the definition of the term "quasi-judicial proceeding" under the Vermont Open Meetings Law.

       <p>
        Fact that minutes of board of selectmen meeting could not be found did not require that meeting be deemed illegal or that action taken at meeting be declared void, since meeting was duly warned and therefore open to public, and uncontroverted testimony established that minutes were taken and filed according to custom.

        When a school district's board of directors entered into a separation agreement with its superintendent during an emergency executive session, any procedural violations of the open meeting law were effectively cured when the board met at its regularly scheduled public meeting and voted in open session to ratify and confirm the agreement. There was no statutory requirement that the board specifically disclose or discuss the underlying details at the public meeting. Katz v. S. Burlington Sch. Dist., 185 Vt. 621, 970 A.2d 1226 (mem.) (2009).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        There was no merit to plaintiff's claim that the confidentiality, nondisparagement, and severance-pay provisions of an agreement between a school district and its superintendent were void as against public policy and therefore could not have been ratified by the district's board at an open meeting. The issue of confidentiality was essentially moot inasmuch as the board released the full text of the agreement and thus satisfied any public policy concerns regarding the right to disclosure; plaintiff's vague allegation that the nondisparagement clause might prevent the superintendent from "blowing the whistle on the district's corruption" was plainly insufficient to void the clause on public policy grounds; and his claim that public policy was violated by the expenditure of taxpayer money without explaining how and why the money was spent was simply a restatement of his rejected claim that a vote in open session failed to provide adequate discussion and disclosure of the agreement. Katz v. S. Burlington Sch. Dist., 185 Vt. 621, 970 A.2d 1226 (mem.) (2009).

        Although defendant town violated 1 V.S.A. 313(a)(1) of Vermont's Open Meeting Law when the selectboard held an executive session discussing the appointment of the town manager for the position of zoning administrator and the collective bargaining agreement, without showing that public knowledge of the issue would disadvantage the town, there had been no showing of continuing Open Meeting Law violations and since plaintiff former town zoning administrator and assessor was no longer employed by the town and would not suffer damages unique to her if the town violated the Open Meeting Law, and since injunctive relief would merely order that the town comply with the law and the court presumed the town would comply with that obligation with or without a court order, the court therefore declined to order injunctive relief under 1 V.S.A. 314(b). Berlickij v. Town of Castleton, 327 F. Supp. 2d 371 (D. Vt. 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not provide that actions taken in violation of the law are void; instead, 1 V.S.A.
        §
        312(a) provides only that actions taken outside an open meeting, with one exception, are ineffective unless ratified in an open meeting. Once so ratified, such actions are effective and binding on the public body. Valley Realty & Development, Inc. v. Town of Hartford, 165 Vt. 463, 685 A.2d 292 (1996).

        Although appellant, as a member of the public body that he alleged violated the Open Meeting Law, could qualify as "any person aggrieved" entitled to seek enforcement of the law in the wake of the public body's refusal to recognize, and correct, the alleged violation, his complaint did not allege injuries that were sufficient to confer standing under the law, for his allegations were of speculative injuries arising from the potential exclusion of unknown members of the public. He provided no evidence that a member of the public was actually denied access to the meeting, or was deterred from attending it, therefore violating his right to an open meeting as a member of a public body. Severson v. City of Burlington, - Vt.
    - , 215 A.3d 102 (June 7, 2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the interest of a member of a public body in that body's compliance with the Open Meeting Law is as significant as that of any other member of the public, members of a public body have a cognizable interest in enforcement of the law. Severson v. City of Burlington, - Vt.

        Former administrator's damages claims and request for reinstatement and back pay were dismissed against the town and its officials, as they had legislative immunity; claims for declaratory and injunctive relief and for damages against the town on First Amendment, retaliation, and open-meetings claims were not dismissed, as the administrator might show standing to sue from exclusion of the administrator and the public from secret meetings.

    <p>
     This subchapter was intended to mirror the constitutional right of access to, inter alia, information relating to the activities of law enforcement officers and to information concerning crime in the community; the reach of this right to access is determined by balancing the interest in disclosure with the state interest in protecting the public from criminal activity, prosecuting those who commit crimes, and protecting the privacy rights of individual citizens.

       It is the policy of this subchapter to provide for free and open examination of records consistent with Chapter I, Article 6 of the Vermont Constitution. Officers of government are trustees and servants of the people and it is in the public interest to enable any person to review and criticize their decisions even though such examination may cause inconvenience or embarrassment. All people, however, have a right to privacy in their personal and economic pursuits, which ought to be protected unless specific information is needed to review the action of a governmental officer. Consistent with these principles, the General Assembly hereby declares that certain public records shall be made available to any person as hereinafter provided. To that end, the provisions of this subchapter shall be liberally construed to implement this policy, and the burden of proof shall be on the public agency to sustain its action.

      <li id="t01c05sub03s315ol1b">
       The General Assembly finds that public records are essential to the administration of State and local government. Public records contain information that allows government programs to function, provides officials with a basis for making decisions, and ensures continuity with past operations. Public records document the legal responsibilities of government, help protect the rights of citizens, and provide citizens a means of monitoring government programs and measuring the performance of public officials. Public records provide documentation for the functioning of government and for the retrospective analysis of the development of Vermont government and the impact of programs on citizens.

        Express, overarching goal of the Vermont Access to Public Records Act of ensuring public access to review and criticize the performance of public officials, even though such examination may cause inconvenience or embarrassment, plainly must take precedence over preserving electoral "purity" or stability.

       <p>
        Elections statute permits - but does not require - the destruction of ballots and tally sheets after the expiration of the preservation period; thus, in the absence of a clear statutory provision or purpose requiring that these election materials remain under seal if not destroyed, the Vermont Supreme Court is constrained to construe the provision narrowly to permit the disclosure promoted by the Vermont Access to Public Records Act. There is no contrary intent in the few specific statutes authorizing the unsealing of ballots in certain limited circumstances, such as where a container is damaged, or in the provisions for disclosure of other election materials, such as "spoiled" ballots.

        Where plaintiff specifically sought specified communications to or from individual state employees or officials regardless of whether the records were located on private or state accounts, the Office of the Attorney General's obligation to conduct a reasonable search included asking those individual employees or officials to provide any public records stored in their private accounts that were responsive to plaintiff's request.

       If copying equipment maintained for use by a public agency is used by the agency to copy the public record or document requested, the agency may charge and collect from the person requesting the copy the actual cost of providing the copy. The agency may also charge and collect from the person making the request, the costs associated with mailing or transmitting the record by facsimile or other electronic means. Nothing in this section shall exempt any person from paying fees otherwise established by law for obtaining copies of public records or documents, but if such fee is established for the copy, no additional costs or fees shall be charged.

       Unless otherwise provided by law, in the following instances an agency may also charge and collect the cost of staff time associated with complying with a request for a copy of a public record: (1) the time directly involved in complying with the request exceeds 30 minutes; (2) the agency agrees to create a public record; or (3) the agency agrees to provide the public record in a nonstandard format and the time directly involved in complying with the request exceeds 30 minutes. The agency may require that requests subject to staff time charges under this subsection be made in writing and that all charges be paid, in whole or in part, prior to delivery of the copies. Upon request, the agency shall provide an estimate of the charge.

       The Secretary of State, after consultation with the Secretary of Administration, shall establish the actual cost of providing a copy of a public record that may be charged by State agencies. The Secretary shall also establish the amount that may be charged for staff time, when such a charge is authorized under this section. To determine "actual cost," the Secretary shall consider the following only: the cost of the paper or the electronic media onto which a public record is copied, a prorated amount for maintenance and replacement of the machine or equipment used to copy the record, and any utility charges directly associated with copying a record. The Secretary of State shall adopt, by rule, a uniform schedule of public record charges for State agencies.

       After public hearing, the legislative body of a political subdivision shall establish actual cost charges for copies of public records. The legislative body shall also establish the amount that may be charged for staff time, when such a charge is authorized under this section. To determine actual cost charges, the legislative body shall use the same factors used by the Secretary of State. If a legislative body fails to establish a uniform schedule of charges, the charges for that political subdivision shall be the uniform schedule of charges established by the Secretary of State until the local legislative body establishes such a schedule. A schedule of public records charges shall be posted in prominent locations in the town offices.

       State agencies shall provide receipts for all monies received under this section.

Amounts collected by a State agency under this section for the cost of staff time associated with providing copies shall be deposited in the General Fund, unless another disposition or use of revenues received by that agency is specifically authorized by law.

       Standard formats for copies of public records shall be as follows: for copies in paper form, a photocopy of a paper public record or a hard copy print-out of a public record maintained in electronic form; for copies in electronic form, the format in which the record is maintained. Any format other than the formats described in this subsection is a nonstandard format.

       <p>
        Plain language of the statute governing access to public records separates requests to copy from requests to inspect, and the section only authorizes charges for staff time associated with requests for copies - not requests to inspect. Thus, a police department could not charge for staff time spent in complying with a request to inspect, even when the police department would have to create a second, redacted version of the requested material in order to comply with the inspection request.

        Public had the right to access the affidavit of probable cause prepared by a university police force because it was an agency record that fell outside of the Vermont Rules for Public Access to Court Records and did not qualify as confidential under the Access to Public Records Act.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Under the common law executive privilege, documents reflecting communications in the course of the Governor's decision-making and deliberative process may be withheld from the public to protect and facilitate the Governor's consultative and decisional responsibilities. Herald Ass'n, Inc. v. Dean, 174 Vt. 350, 816 A.2d 469 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Documents covered by the common law executive privilege enjoy presumptive confidentiality, which can be overcome only by a showing that the requester has a need for the documents that outweighs the interest in confidentiality. Herald Ass'n, Inc. v. Dean, 174 Vt. 350, 816 A.2d 469 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to make a prima facie case of executive privilege in response to a request for documents, the executive must specifically identify the documents for which the privilege is claimed, and must explain why the documents are protected by the privilege. Herald Ass'n, Inc. v. Dean, 174 Vt. 350, 816 A.2d 469 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Information in the Governor's daily schedule showing meetings or events unrelated to executive policy making or deliberations, including meetings and events related to the Governor's consideration of a potential bid for President of the United States, was not sufficiently related to gubernatorial policymaking or deliberations to qualify for confidential treatment under the executive privilege and, accordingly, that information must be disclosed. Herald Ass'n, Inc. v. Dean, 174 Vt. 350, 816 A.2d 469 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the assertion of executive privilege over the Governor's daily schedule in its entirety was too broad, the Governor was not required to disclose the entirety of his schedule immediately; on remand, if plaintiffs seek disclosure of additional information on meetings or events related to the Governor's deliberations and policymaking, the Governor shall be afforded an opportunity to make a prima facie case, specific to those entries. Herald Ass'n, Inc. v. Dean, 174 Vt. 350, 816 A.2d 469 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        A person seeking disclosure of documents concerning which an agency has made a prima facie case for executive privilege must first demonstrate why the need for the information outweighs the interest in confidentiality before obtaining a right to in camera inspection by the court; common law executive privilege was incorporated into the statute with its established burdens. Killington, Ltd. v. Lash, 153 Vt. 628, 572 A.2d 1368 (1990).

         4. Detection and investigation.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Determination of whether police have effected an arrest for purposes of the Public Records Act is a fact-dependent analysis. An investigative detention may become too intrusive to be classified as such, and may instead become the functional equivalent of a formal arrest. Galloway v. Town of Hartford, 192 Vt. 171, 57 A.3d 684 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court looks at the totality of the circumstances to determine if an investigative detention has crossed the line and become a de facto arrest for purposes of the Public Records Act; there is no bright-line rule to distinguish the two situations. The court considers a number of factors in determining whether a detention amounted to an arrest: the amount of force used by police, the need for such force, and the extent to which the individual's freedom of movement was restrained, and in particular such factors as the number of agents involved, whether the target of the stop was suspected of being armed, the duration of the stop, and the physical treatment of the suspect, including whether or not handcuffs were used. Galloway v. Town of Hartford, 192 Vt. 171, 57 A.3d 684 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Detention of a suspected burglar who turned out to be the homeowner was a de facto arrest for purposes of the Public Records Act; accordingly, the records relating to his initial detention were subject to disclosure. The homeowner was pepper-sprayed and struck repeatedly with a baton; his freedom of movement was entirely restrained for fifteen minutes; three officers handcuffed the homeowner and he was dragged down the stairs and out of his house and forced to sit handcuffed on the sidewalk; and only after fifteen minutes did the police decide there was no basis for criminal charges against the homeowner and remove the handcuffs. Galloway v. Town of Hartford, 192 Vt. 171, 57 A.3d 684 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the plain language of the Public Records Act, records reflecting the initial arrest of a person shall be public. The courts must weigh competing interests in determining whether a record is public: the privacy interest of the person arrested, the public interest in encouraging transparent government as a foundation of a free democracy, and a separate public interest in ensuring that police can keep society safe are all factors courts must evaluate. Galloway v. Town of Hartford, 192 Vt. 171, 57 A.3d 684 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        With respect to the applicability of the Access to Public Records Act exemption for records "compiled in the course of a criminal or disciplinary investigation by any police or professional licensing agency," as a threshold matter, the agency must prove and the trial court must find that the records sought deal with the detection and investigation of crime. Because this critical finding was absent, remand was required. Herald v. City of Rutland, 191 Vt. 387, 48 A.3d 568 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Language of the Access to Public Records Act exemption for records "compiled in the course of a criminal or disciplinary investigation by any police or professional licensing agency" plainly requires that records deal with the detection and investigation of crime to fall within this exemption. Only when this requirement is satisfied can such records include those maintained on any individual or compiled in the course of a criminal or disciplinary investigation by any police or professional licensing agency. Herald v. City of Rutland, 191 Vt. 387, 48 A.3d 568 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Access to Public Records Act exemption for records "compiled in the course of a criminal or disciplinary investigation by any police or professional licensing agency" recognizes that the police department, like any other public agency, might investigate and discipline its employees for workplace infractions that do not necessarily constitute criminal conduct. Other types of disciplinary investigations might be tied in with a criminal investigation, and the Legislature intended to exclude records involving the latter type, presumably to protect the integrity of the law enforcement and prosecutorial function. Herald v. City of Rutland, 191 Vt. 387, 48 A.3d 568 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        To the extent that the Access to Public Records Act's exemption from disclosure for "records dealing with the detection and investigation of crime" exempted from disclosure the records relating to a criminal investigation sought here, the Legislature had determined that the principle embodied in Article 6 of the Vermont Constitution did not mandate disclosure. The Court would not second-guess that determination. Rutland Herald v. Vt. State Police, 191 Vt. 357, 49 A.3d 91 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont Supreme Court finds no support for the imposition of either a time-based limitation or a balancing test in the plain language of the exemption from disclosure for "records dealing with the detection and investigation of crime." The language instead reflects the Legislature's intent to permanently and categorically exempt all criminal investigatory records from public disclosure. Rutland Herald v. Vt. State Police, 191 Vt. 357, 49 A.3d 91 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont Supreme Court does not find the language used in the exemption from disclosure for "records dealing with the detection and investigation of crime" to be vague and potentially limitless; instead, the Court reads this provision to reflect the Legislature's specific intent to permanently shield all records dealing with the detection and investigation of crime, including those maintained on any individual or compiled in the course of a criminal or disciplinary investigation by any police or professional licensing agency. The statute is broadly worded and it provides a categorical exemption for such records irrespective of their specific content; accordingly, it is not appropriate to read a balancing test into the statute. Rutland Herald v. Vt. State Police, 191 Vt. 357, 49 A.3d 91 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the exemption from disclosure for "records dealing with the detection and investigation of crime" provided a record-based, rather than content-based, limitation, the Vermont Supreme Court rejected plaintiff's argument that the trial court could release investigatory records but require redaction of information. Rutland Herald v. Vt. State Police, 191 Vt. 357, 49 A.3d 91 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Exception in the exemption from disclosure for "records dealing with the detection and investigation of crime" is not information-based. There is no balancing process involved in the implementation of the exemption statute and no statutory standards a court can use to determine what information to disclose and what to redact; redaction does not apply. Rutland Herald v. Vt. State Police, 191 Vt. 357, 49 A.3d 91 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Exemption from disclosure for "records dealing with the detection and investigation of crime" draws no distinction between those records that deal with a criminal investigation of a police officer and those involving a criminal investigation of other citizens. Rutland Herald v. Vt. State Police, 191 Vt. 357, 49 A.3d 91 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the exemption from disclosure for "records dealing with the detection and investigation of crime," a court does not engage in a content-based analysis of records once they have been determined to be "records dealing with the detection and investigation of crime." Such records are wholly exempt from public access. Rutland Herald v. Vt. State Police, 191 Vt. 357, 49 A.3d 91 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in dismissing plaintiff's Access to Public Records Act (PRA) claims against a sheriff on the ground that police radio dispatch and unit logs were exempt from the PRA as records "dealing with the detection and investigation of crime." Assuming that the records existed, the court could not discern from the record precisely what information they might contain. Bain v. Clark, 191 Vt. 190, 44 A.3d 170 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court cannot assume, consistent with the purpose of the Access to Public Records Act, that simply because the records at issue were generated by a law enforcement agency, they necessarily are records "dealing with the detection and investigation of crime." To so hold would allow for a potentially limitless exemption. Bain v. Clark, 191 Vt. 190, 44 A.3d 170 (2012).

       <p>
        Subdivision (b)(5) [now (c)(5)] of this section, exempting from public disclosure certain records dealing with the detection and investigation of crime, should be construed strictly against the custodians of the records and any doubts should be resolved in favor of disclosure.

        Records pertaining to police department employees who viewed and sent pornography on work computers while on duty did not fall under the "personal information" exemption from disclosure under the Public Records Act, and there was no basis to order the trial court to redact personally identifying information concerning the two employees in question. Any privacy interest of the employees was outweighed by the significant public interest in knowing how the police department supervised its employees and responded to allegations of misconduct, and redaction would cast suspicion over the whole department and minimize the hard work and dedication shown by the vast majority of the police department. Rutland Herald v. City of Rutland, 195 Vt. 85, 84 A.3d 821 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Looking at the statutory scheme as a whole, it is apparent that the Legislature intended purely disciplinary investigations - those that do not deal with the detection and investigation of crime - to be evaluated under the "personal documents" exemption from the Access to Public Records Act, except to the extent such investigations may relate to the management and direction of a law enforcement agency and not to a specified individual employee under the exemption for records "compiled in the course of a criminal or disciplinary investigation by any police or professional licensing agency." Herald v. City of Rutland, 191 Vt. 387, 48 A.3d 568 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        As to named individual employees, the personal documents exception to the Access to Public Records Act specifically encompasses information in any files maintained to discipline any employee of a public agency. This assumes, of course, that such disciplinary investigations do not involve records of the Office of Internal Investigation of the Department of Public Safety, which are specifically exempt from public view.

       </p>
       <p>
        With regard to disciplinary letters involving two city employees who were accused of viewing pornography at work, the trial court applied the personal records exemption to the Access to Public Records Act and concluded that the public interest in disclosure outweighed any privacy interest. A union failed to show that the trial court abused its discretion in concluding that the balance of interests favored disclosure of the documents, from which the employees' names and suspension dates had been redacted.

        Based on its examination of an index and supporting affidavits summarizing the evaluation reports at issue, the trial court did not err in forgoing an in camera review to determine that the "personal document" exception applied to at least a portion of the documents.

        Given the circumstances surrounding creation of the Governor's daily schedule, and the essential role it plays in the day-to-day functioning of the Governor's office, the calendar falls within the definition of a public record because it is "produced or acquired in the course of [the Governor's] business."

       </p>
       <p>
        Because the "student records" exception of Public Records Act itself provides an exception for records that may be released, upon request, under the federal Family Education Rights and Privacy Act, the trial court also properly ordered disclosure of the "final results" of any disciplinary proceeding against a student alleged to have committed a "crime of violence" or "nonforcible sex offense" where the college determined that the student violated the college's rules by committing the offense.

        .
       </h5>
       <p>
        Identity and motive of the requestor cannot be considered when weighing access to public documents. Here, the trial court improperly relied in large part, if not wholly, on the purpose of plaintiff's records request to determine the relevance of the withheld documents under the litigation exception to the Access to Public Records Act; while plaintiff's purpose might be strongly indicative of the documents' relevance to the ongoing traffic litigation, the relevance of the documents to the specific pending litigation had to be established independently. Shlansky v. City of Burlington, 188 Vt. 470, 13 A.3d 1075 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Access to Public Records Act represents a strong policy favoring access to public documents and records, and that policy goal would suffer were a court to allow agencies resisting disclosure to avoid it merely by invoking the magic word "relevant" under the litigation exception. To do so would threaten to cut off valuable information not only to the parties to the litigation but to all Vermonters precisely because the litigation exception, if it is to have any meaning, cannot apply solely to an individual litigant. Shlansky v. City of Burlington, 188 Vt. 470, 13 A.3d 1075 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        The plain, ordinary meaning of "relevant" is used in construing the exception for "records which are relevant to litigation." Wesco, Inc. v. Sorrell, 177 Vt. 287, 865 A.2d 350 (October 8, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the legislature wanted to protect public records that are relevant to a pending lawsuit, the exception for "records which are relevant to litigation" is read as exempting from disclosure through a public records request documents that are relevant-related or pertinent-to, and not merely discoverable in, pending or ongoing litigation. Wesco, Inc. v. Sorrell, 177 Vt. 287, 865 A.2d 350 (October 8, 2004).

        In an action in which plaintiff sought disclosure of a letter sent to a town development review board from its attorney, the trial court erred in issuing a decision on summary judgment relying on the assumption that the letter was legal advice because the board's request that prompted the letter was for legal advice; reversal and remand was required so that the court might view the evidence in camera and decide whether any part or all of the letter was legal advice within the meaning of the exemption. 232511 Investments, Ltd. v.

         18. Records prepared for public agency deliberations.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Emails between district commissioners and the commission's counsel, all of which concerned the basis for one district commission's decision to disqualify itself from hearing an Act 250 application, fell within the plain language of the exemption from disclosure for "records of, or internal materials prepared for, the deliberations of any public agency acting in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity." The district commissions were public agencies that acted in a quasi-judicial capacity, and the documents were "records. .. of the deliberations" of the district commission. Rueger v. Natural Res. Bd., 191 Vt. 429, 49 A.3d 112 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no dispute that district commissions are public agencies that act in a quasi-judicial capacity, as the commissions hear evidence and issue rulings in the manner of a court, and their decisions are subject to review by the Environmental Division. Their work satisfies an ordinary understanding of the term "quasi-judicial" for purposes of the exemption from disclosure for "records of, or internal materials prepared for, the deliberations of any public agency acting in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity," and it is also consistent with the definition of the term "quasi-judicial proceeding" under the Vermont Open Meetings Law. Rueger v. Natural Res. Bd., 191 Vt. 429, 49 A.3d 112 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Email discussions between the members of a district commission and an assigned staff attorney as to whether a case should be transferred fit well within the plain meaning of the word "deliberations" under the exemption from disclosure for "records of, or internal materials prepared for, the deliberations of any public agency acting in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity." There could be no question, moreover, that the emails were "records" of such deliberations. Rueger v. Natural Res. Bd., 191 Vt. 429, 49 A.3d 112 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont Legislature has determined that all judicial or quasi-judicial "deliberations" are exempt from disclosure; it does not purport to incorporate a "deliberative process privilege" or distinguish between a quasi-judicial agency's "working law" and other material. In any event, even assuming arguendo that the federal deliberative process doctrine was somehow incorporated into the exemption from disclosure for "records of, or internal materials prepared for, the deliberations of any public agency acting in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity," federal case law clearly recognizes that an agency's "pre-decisional communications" are exempt from public view. Rueger v. Natural Res. Bd., 191 Vt. 429, 49 A.3d 112 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plain language of the exemption from disclosure for "records of, or internal materials prepared for, the deliberations of any public agency acting in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity" does not call for a balancing test, and there are no grounds for reading such test into the statute. The language used in the exemption is not vague and potentially limitless; rather, the statute reflects the Legislature's intent to categorically exempt all records of, or internal materials prepared for, the deliberations of any public agency acting in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity. Rueger v. Natural Res. Bd., 191 Vt. 429, 49 A.3d 112 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether or not a claim of executive privilege will be honored is a question always contingent on a balancing of the interests of confidentiality against those of disclosure; the fact that a balancing may be inherent in implementing the common law executive privilege has no bearing on the court's interpretation of the exemption from disclosure for "records of, or internal materials prepared for, the deliberations of any public agency acting in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity." It is evident from the statute's plain language that, in enacting the exemption, the Legislature evaluated the competing interests and concluded that a blanket exemption on quasi-judicial deliberations was appropriate. Rueger v. Natural Res. Bd., 191 Vt. 429, 49 A.3d 112 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no support for plaintiffs' assertion that defendants waived their right to the exemption from disclosure for "records of, or internal materials prepared for, the deliberations of any public agency acting in a judicial or quasi-judicial capacity" because agency officials stated the reasons for their decision to a resident and to a newspaper reporter. Rueger v. Natural Res. Bd., 191 Vt. 429, 49 A.3d 112 (2012).

         1. Purpose.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        This subchapter is aimed at expeditious resolution of disputes over whether a citizen will have access to a public record; the custodian of the record has an obligation to produce it promptly or within two business days certify the reasons for denial of access; in unusual circumstances, the time for responding, either with disclosure or a claim of exception, can be extended up to ten working days. Finberg v. Murnane, 159 Vt. 431, 623 A.2d 979 (1992).

         2. Time Limits.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Because the statute does not provide a negative consequence for an agency's failure to comply with the time requirement, nor does it specify a remedy such as a "deemed approval" or "waiver of exemptions," the time requirement for a custodian to certify that it considers a record to be exempt is intended to be directory rather than mandatory. Shlansky v. City of Burlington, 188 Vt. 470, 13 A.3d 1075 (2010).

         3. Election records.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Under circumstances where a request under the Vermont Access to Public Records Act (PRA) is pending, the destruction of ballots must be treated as unauthorized. The PRA establishes a clear and orderly process for the handling of PRA requests, which would be circumvented, and the citizen's right to access defeated, if the statute giving discretionary authority to destroy ballots and tally sheets after the preservation period has expired were applied to allow the custodian to unilaterally destroy the requested ballots and tally sheets even when an access request remains pending. Price v. Town of Fairlee, 190 Vt. 66, 26 A.3d 26 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        While the custodian may have a good faith belief that the records may be destroyed in reliance upon the elections statute; nevertheless, this is precisely the sort of legal conclusion that the review process under the Vermont Access to Public Records Act was established to determine. Accordingly, the discretionary authority to destroy ballots and tally sheets after the preservation period has expired must be stayed when a public-records request for the material is filed, and the stay must remain in effect until the request is resolved. Price v. Town of Fairlee, 190 Vt. 66, 26 A.3d 26 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        No legislative policy evident from the election statutes, whether considered singly or as a whole, was furthered by maintaining the confidentiality of ballots and tally sheets from a 2006 election. The preservation period for the election in question had expired, the election results were final, and the purpose of maintaining the ballots under seal had been served. Price v. Town of Fairlee, 190 Vt. 66, 26 A.3d 26 (2011).

         4. Mootness.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in not dismissing a complaint under the Vermont Access to Public Records Act seeking election ballots and tally sheets as moot. The destruction of the ballots meant that the action to be challenged was a fait accompli, and its duration was over before the issue could be joined in court. The State had not challenged the trial court's findings that plaintiff would likely continue to request access to the town's past election ballots based on his "continuing interest" in evaluating the performance of the town's election officials and that the town's response would likely be the same. Price v. Town of Fairlee, 190 Vt. 66, 26 A.3d 26 (2011).

         5. Exhaustion of remedies.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Because plaintiff failed to request any public records from a county state's attorney, and there was no merit to plaintiff's claim that the attorney was in privity with a sheriff, his Access to Public Records Act claim against her was properly dismissed for failure to exhaust his administrative remedies. Bain v. Clark, 191 Vt. 190, 44 A.3d 170 (2012).

       <p>
        In camera inspection of requested documents by the court can irrevocably sacrifice the interest sought to be protected by the exercise of executive privilege, even if the court ultimately decides that the interest in confidentiality outweighs the need for disclosure. Killington, Ltd. v. Lash, 153 Vt. 628, 572 A.2d 1368 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where in camera inspection of requested documents might materially and irrevocably compromise the fundamental interests of the executive branch of government, the governor or agency may seek judicial review after the inspection order issues but before it is effected. Killington, Ltd. v. Lash, 153 Vt. 628, 572 A.2d 1368 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Superior Court order for in camera review of requested documents, concerning which a claim of executive privilege was made, was remanded to allow plaintiff to meet its burden of showing necessity for the documents. Killington, Ltd. v. Lash, 153 Vt. 628, 572 A.2d 1368 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        A person seeking disclosure of documents concerning which an agency has made a prima facie case for executive privilege must first demonstrate why the need for the information outweighs the interest in confidentiality before obtaining a right to in camera inspection by the court; common law executive privilege was incorporated into the statute with its established burdens. Killington, Ltd. v. Lash, 153 Vt. 628, 572 A.2d 1368 (1990).

         3. Attorney's fees.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Vermont Access to Public Records Act's plain language and purpose foreclose granting attorney's fees to substantially prevailing self-represented litigants, regardless of whether they happen to be attorneys. Thus, plaintiff, an attorney who represented himself and who substantially prevailed in a case brought under the Act, was not entitled to attorney's fees. Toensing v. AG of Vt., 210 Vt. 74, 212 A.3d 180 (2019).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether newspaper in lawsuit against university seeking release of documents was entitled to attorney's fees, the following federal factors could be considered along with any other relevant factors: (1) the public benefit derived by the lawsuit; (2) the commercial benefit the requesting party will receive from release of the requested documents; (3) the nature of the requesting party's interest in the documents; and (4) whether the public agency had a reasonable basis for withholding the documents. The Burlington Free Press v. University of Vermont, 172 Vt. 303, 779 A.2d 60 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining whether newspaper in lawsuit against university seeking release of documents met its burden of showing that trial court failed to exercise its discretion in denying award of attorney fees, it was first necessary to consider whether plaintiff substantially prevailed in its lawsuit and thus was eligible for attorney's fees. The Burlington Free Press v. University of Vermont, 172 Vt. 303, 779 A.2d 60 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Based on the trial court's statement indicating its belief that newspaper's lawsuit against university was necessary for release of documents it sought, it met the threshold test that it substantially prevailed, thereby requiring consideration as to whether it was entitled to attorney's fees. The Burlington Free Press v. University of Vermont, 172 Vt. 303, 779 A.2d 60 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        News organizations are not automatically entitled to attorney's fees when an award of fees does not serve as an incentive to encourage either the requesting party to seek the release of documents or the public agency to remove resistance to their release. The Burlington Free Press v. University of Vermont, 172 Vt. 303, 779 A.2d 60 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        In lawsuit against university by newspaper seeking release of documents related to hazing incidents, trial court's denial of plaintiff's request for attorney's fees was not an abuse of discretion where the denial was based on several factors, including that (1) university's decision not to release many of the documents was not only reasonable, but advisable; (2) attorney's fee award was not necessary to remedy situation in which state agency delayed release of public documents in the hopes that the delay and ensuing litigation would create a financial barrier to those seeking the documents; and (3) some of the documents would have been released anyway because of the federal lawsuit filed by the complaining student. The Burlington Free Press v. University of Vermont, 172 Vt. 303, 779 A.2d 60 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was within discretion of trial court to award attorney's fees to prevailing plaintiffs in action seeking declaration that Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Vermont was subject to Open Meeting Law and Public Records Act. Animal Legal Defense Fund, Inc. v. Institutional Animal Care & Use Committee of the University of Vermont, 159 Vt. 133, 616 A.2d 224 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        In action seeking declaration that Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of University of Vermont was subject to Open Meeting Law and Public Records Act, award of $3,713 attorney's fees, which amounted to one-half of prevailing plaintiffs' requested fees, was not unreasonable. Animal Legal Defense Fund, Inc. v. Institutional Animal Care & Use Committee of the University of Vermont, 159 Vt. 133, 616 A.2d 224 (1992).

       <p>
        On a claim under the Public Records Act, the trial court did not improperly shift the burden of proof to plaintiff; it merely required some claim from plaintiff that the development review board members were withholding documents. Plaintiff never made such a claim - he in fact conceded production - so the trial court did not err. Pease v. Windsor Development Review Board, 190 Vt. 639, 35 A.3d 1019 (mem.) (2011).

       "(1) For more than 137 years, Juneteenth National Freedom Day has been the most recognized African-American holiday observance in the United States and is also known by other names, including 'Emancipation Day,' 'Freedom Day,' and 'Jun-Jun.'
      </p>
      <p>
       "(2) This special observance commemorates the issuance of General Order No. 3 that Union Major General Gordon Granger read publicly in Galveston, Texas on June 19, 1865 declaring 'that in accordance with a Proclamation from the Executive of the United States (the Emancipation Proclamation that President Abraham Lincoln issued on January 1, 1863), all slaves are free. This involves an absolute equality of rights and rights of property between former masters and slaves...'
      </p>
      <p>
       "(3) This observance commemorates the 'strength and determination of African-Americans who were first brought to this country stacked in the bottom of slave ships in a month's long journey across the Atlantic Ocean known as the Middle Passage.'
      </p>
      <p>
       "(4) In recent years, there has been a resurgence of Juneteenth festivities on both the state and national levels, and this important celebration of African-American freedom deserves designation as a commemorative state holiday in Vermont in order to remember the injustices that African-Americans endured during their enslavement and to commemorate their emancipation."

The specially-appointed panel, pursuant to the resolution, conducted the selection process in a fair and impartial manner. A total of 107 entries was received. After a careful review, eight songs were selected as finalists, aired on the state's public radio and television networks, and posted on the Vermont Arts Council's World Wide Web site. All Vermonters were invited to participate in the review of the final eight selections. As a result of this public process, the winning song was 'These Green Mountains,' composed by Diane Martin and arranged by Rita Buglass. The public and representatives of for profit and not-for-profit organizations may perform or invite the performance of the song for any reason without compensation to or permission from the composer".

    1 provides: "The only traditional breed of cattle to have originated in Vermont is the Randall Lineback. The Randall Lineback breed is named for the Samuel Randall family of Sunderland who developed the breed approximately 100 years ago by carefully preserving a closed herd. The breed's appearance and striking color pattern set it apart from the standardized breed and distinguish it as unique. As recently as 1985, the Randall Lineback breed faced extinction when the remaining herd reached a low of between 15 and 20 head. Today, the Randall Lineback breed is growing, but still remains critically rare with fewer than 200 head registered nationally. In consideration of the contributions of the Randall Lineback breed to the agricultural history of Vermont, the state recognizes that preservation of this critically rare breed is integral to the heritage of Vermont."

    1 provides: "In recognition of the importance that sports and fitness can play in the personal lives of Vermonters and in the economic well-being of the state, the general assembly finds:
      </p>
      <p>
       "(1) The history of skiing and snowboarding is heavily linked to Vermont.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(2) In 1934, the country's first ski area opened near Woodstock when the first rope tow ski lift was installed on Clinton Gilbert's farm. This was followed by many other historical Vermont firsts in the ski industry, including the nation's first ski race which was held on Mount Mansfield in 1934, the nation's first J-bar lift which was installed at Bromley Ski Area in 1936, the nation's first ski patrol which was established at Stowe Ski Area in 1936, the nation's first T-bar lift which was installed at Pico Peak Ski Area in 1940, and the nation's first major chair lift which was installed at the Stowe Ski Area in 1940.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(3) In 1938, C. Minot Dole founded the National Ski Patrol in Vermont. Dole later used the National Ski Patrol model to convince the U.S. Army to activate a division of American mountain soldiers on skis, known as the 10th Mountain Division. Approximately 240 Vermonters served in the famed winter warfare division during World War II, with a dozen killed in action in the battle against the Germans in the Italian Alps.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(4) In 1952, Rutland's Andrea Mead-Lawrence, whose parents ran Pico Mountain, became the first American woman to win two Olympic gold medals in skiing. Stowe's Billy Kidd won the silver medal at the 1964 Innsbruck Olympics and the gold and bronze medals at the 1970 World Championships.
      </p>
      <p>
       "The skiing Cochrans\-Barbara Ann, Lindy, Marilyn, and Bobby\-from Richmond dominated the world racing scene in the 1960s and 1970s, with Barbara Ann winning the gold medal at the 1972 winter Olympics. Nordic skier Bill Koch, from Brattleboro, skied in four Olympics\-1976, 1980, 1984, and 1992. Koch won the 1976 silver medal, a first for an American Nordic skier, a bronze medal in the 1982 Federation Internationale de Ski Nordic World Championships, and a bronze medal in the 1982 World Cup Championships. Most recently, at the 2010 Winter Olympics, Hannah Kearney of Norwich won the gold medal in the women's freestyle skiing event.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(5) Vermont is home to many public schools, academies, and colleges that are world-class training grounds for skiing and snowboarding.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(6) In 1982, the Suicide Six Resort in Pomfret was the first resort in the United States to allow snowboarding.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(7) In the 1980s, Vermont was the first state in the country to host what is now known as a snowboard park at the Sonnenberg Ski Area in Barnard.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(8) The U.S. Open for Snowboarding is held in Vermont. This event is the renowned first competition for snowboarding and offers an exciting opportunity to watch the world's best snowboarders exhibiting their skills.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(9) At the 2002 Winter Olympics, Ross Powers of Stratton and Kelly Clark of Dover won the men's and women's gold medal respectively in the snowboarding halfpipe event.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(10) The United States Olympic Committee named Hannah Teeter of Belmont, the 2006 Winter Olympics women's halfpipe gold medalist, as the 2006 Sportswoman of the Year, the top honor that the committee confers. She returned to the Winter Olympics in 2010 to win a silver medal in the women's halfpipe while Kelly Clark followed immediately behind her in the competition, capturing the bronze medal.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(11) The United States Olympic Committee named former United States Halfpipe Head Coach Bud Keene of Stowe the 2006 National Coach of the Year.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(12) In 1977, Vermonter Jake Burton Carpenter founded a snowboard company in his barn and perfected the technology to build snowboards. Today, this Burlington-based company is the worldwide leader in the manufacture and sale of snowboards. Jake and Donna Burton Carpenter were inducted into the United States National Ski and Snowboarding Hall of Fame in 2007.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(13) Increasingly, there is an alarmingly high number of obese children in the United States. Both skiing and snowboarding promote healthy outdoor exercise for children, their parents, and people of all ages.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(14) Vermont historically ranks as the third largest ski and snowboard state, with over four million snowboarder and skier visits per year, and both sports are a critical part of our state's economy, heritage, and way of life.
      </p>
      <p>
       "(15) Designating skiing and snowboarding as the Vermont state sports will encourage individuals to travel to Vermont to ski and snowboard where they will patronize local hotels and restaurants and purchase Vermont goods and services."

        In the event lands acquired by the United States cease to be held and occupied by it for a public purpose, federal jurisdiction would terminate and revert to the state by virtue of this section; no additional legislation would be necessary to accept retrocession of jurisdiction on behalf of the state. 1968-70 Op.

     Revision note.
    </b>
    Reference to "finance director" in the second sentence changed to "commissioner of finance" to conform reference to new title and reorganization of state government pursuant to <cite class="vt-code">1971, No. 92</cite>.
    See
    
     §
    
    2201 et seq. of Title 3.
      </p>
      <p>
       Substituted "commissioner of finance and management" for "commissioner of finance and information support" in the second sentence in light of Executive Order No. 35-87, which provided for the abolition of the department of finance and information support and the transfer of the duties, responsibilities and authority of the commissioner of that entity to the commissioner of the department of finance and management as established by the order. By its own terms, Executive Order No. 35-87 took effect on July 1, 1987, pursuant to section 2002 of Title 3. For the text of Executive Order No. 35-87, see chapter 1 of Title 3 Appendix.

     </h3>
     <p>
      The General Assembly finds that:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t01c23s851ol11">
       At least 1,700 Vermonters claim to be direct descendants of the several indigenous Native American peoples, now known as Western Abenaki tribes, who originally inhabited all of Vermont and New Hampshire, parts of western Maine, parts of southern Quebec, and parts of upstate New York for hundreds of years, beginning long before the arrival of Europeans.
      </li>
      <li id="t01c23s851ol12">
       There is ample archaeological evidence that demonstrates that the Missisquoi and Cowasuck Abenaki were indigenous to and farmed the river floodplains of Vermont at least as far back as the 1100s A.D.
      </li>
      <li id="t01c23s851ol13">
       The Western Abenaki, including the Missisquoi, have a very definite and carefully maintained oral tradition that consistently references the Champlain valley in western Vermont.
      </li>
      <li id="t01c23s851ol14">
       State recognition confers official acknowledgment of the long-standing existence in Vermont of Native American Indians who predated European settlement and enhances dignity and pride in their heritage and community.
      </li>
      <li id="t01c23s851ol15">
       Many contemporary Abenaki families continue to produce traditional crafts and intend to continue to pass on these indigenous traditions to the younger generations. In order to create and sell Abenaki crafts that may be labeled as Indian- or Native American-produced, the Abenaki must be recognized by the State of Vermont.
      </li>
      <li id="t01c23s851ol16">
       According to a public affairs specialist with the U.S. Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA), State recognition of Indian tribes plays a very small role with regard to federal recognition. The only exception is when a state recognized a tribe before 1900.
      </li>
      <li id="t01c23s851ol17">
       At least 15 other states have recognized their resident indigenous people as Native American Indian tribes without any of those tribes previously or subsequently acquiring federal recognition.
      </li>
      <li id="t01c23s851ol18">
       State-recognized Native American Indian tribes and their members will continue to be subject to all laws of the State, and recognition shall not be construed to create any basis or authority for tribes to establish or promote any form of prohibited gambling activity or to claim any interest in land or real estate in Vermont.
