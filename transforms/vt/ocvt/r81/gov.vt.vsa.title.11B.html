         1. Liability following reinstatement.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Whether reinstatement of a corporation after an involuntary dissolution operates to shield personal liability must depend on the reasonable expectations of the parties at the time the liability arises. These expectations will be shaped by the context in which the liability arises, especially the nature of the obligation, the parties' knowledge, and the timing of the corporate termination and the liability. Daniels v. Elks Club of Hartford, 192 Vt. 114, 58 A.3d 925 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        It would be a clear abuse of a club's status to deny liability of the members when after operating for nineteen years as a voluntary association because of the involuntary termination of its corporate status, the club reinstated its corporate status less than two months after the final judgment on the merits of discrimination litigation. By that time, it knew that it faced a judgment of at least $25,000 and the future imposition of a large attorney's fee award against it; it then reinstated its corporate status, potentially eliminating the responsibility of members to pay the judgment if the club could not do so. Daniels v. Elks Club of Hartford, 192 Vt. 114, 58 A.3d 925 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Reinstatement of the corporate status after involuntary dissolution will not restore the corporate shield on personal liability for a person who knew, or should have known by virtue of the person's position, that there was no corporate shield at the time of the act that created liability. This rule conforms to the principle that the reinstatement provision should be interpreted in a manner that preserves the expectations of the parties at the time when the liability arose. Daniels v. Elks Club of Hartford, 192 Vt. 114, 58 A.3d 925 (2012).
