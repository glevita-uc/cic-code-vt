        Section 9817 of Title 32, making appeal to the Superior Court the exclusive remedy for review of a decision of the Commissioner of Taxes, precluded direct appeal to the Supreme Court from a decision of the Commissioner, but not an appeal from a subsequent Superior Court decision.

         2. Interlocutory appeals.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Jurisdictional scheme for appeals in Vermont is that a final judgment is a prerequisite to appellate jurisdiction unless the narrow circumstances authorizing an interlocutory appeal are present, and Supreme Court has broad authorization to adopt rules regarding the procedure for taking appeals from orders that are not final judgments. In re J.G., 160 Vt. 250, 627 A.2d 362 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        For order to be reviewable before final judgment, it must conclusively determine the disputed question, resolve an important issue completely separate from merits of action, and be effectively unreviewable on appeal from final judgment. State v. Fisher, 150 Vt. 655, 555 A.2d 368 (mem.) (1988).
       </p>

       </h5>
       <p>
        When defendant was convicted on two counts of boating while intoxicated, and the second count was reversed on appeal because both convictions arose out of the same incident, the court had the power to order resentencing on the remaining count when the trial court had sentenced defendant on the first count based on harm to only one of the two victims. Defendant by appealing his convictions placed the entire judgment in issue, and the holding on appeal in no way decreased his culpability or called into question the sentencing judge's assessment of the scope of the necessary punishment.

       <p>
        Under the authority granted to the court to issue orders that might be necessary to the furtherance of justice, the facts warranted reinstatement of petitioner's right of appeal from his first postconviction relief petition, as this and the underlying case had been plagued by extraordinary delay, the error of appointed counsel in failing to file a timely notice of appeal was inexcusable, and petitioner had received no help in regaining his appeal right. The failure here was not simply of the assigned counsel to timely file a notice of appeal but of the whole system thereafter to protect petitioner's rights. In re Babson, 197 Vt. 535, 107 A.3d 339 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a defendant challenges his convictions in a case where his sentences are interdependent, that challenge necessitates review and redetermination of the full sentencing package. Remands are therefore necessary in aid of the court's appellate jurisdiction, and to ensure the regular execution of the law; the District Court, although its power to resentence is limited, may be imbued with that power by a proper order of the Supreme Court of Vermont. State v. Martin, 185 Vt. 286, 973 A.2d 56 (2009).

      The Supreme Court shall have administrative and disciplinary control of all judicial officers of the State, in addition to and not inconsistent with the constitutional powers of the General Assembly in those matters.
    It shall adopt and promulgate a Code of Judicial Ethics which shall be binding on those officers for disciplinary purposes.
    It may issue rules and regulations providing for the exercise of disciplinary control, including providing for the manner of making and disposing of complaints of violations of judicial ethics, a committee of the Judiciary for determining issues raised by complaints, and imposing sanctions, including when appropriate suspension from judicial duties for the balance of the term of the judicial officer charged.

        Subsection (a) of this section, requiring justices, who assume office as successors to justices who leave the bench prior to the end of their term, to serve out the unexpired term of their predecessor rather than be appointed to an initial six-year term of their own, is constitutional.

       <p>
        Principle of necessity required that Supreme Court justices sit on a case challenging the constitutionality of a moratorium on civil jury trials which had been ordered by the court; since the challenged actions were taken by the justices in their official capacity, appointment of substitute justices would not eliminate the asserted disqualification to act.

        Civil division has original and exclusive jurisdiction of all original civil actions, apart from certain exceptions; moreover, within that general jurisdiction, the divisions of the superior court have the power under the Declaratory Judgment Act to declare rights, status, and other legal relations whether or not further relief is or could be claimed. Hence, the civil division presumptively had jurisdiction over the declaratory judgment action here, and defendant was required to preserve, by raising before the trial court, his contention that the court lacked authority under the circumstances of the case to adjudicate plaintiff's request for declaratory relief.

        Statutory scheme in place when defendant was charged in 2010 for crimes he allegedly committed when he was a juvenile provided the family division with exclusive original jurisdiction to adjudicate charges alleging delinquent acts committed by defendants under the age of fourteen. The family division's jurisdiction over juvenile delinquency proceedings is exclusive and takes precedence over any inconsistent criminal law provisions, but normally ends when the juvenile reaches eighteen years of age.

       In accordance with the direction of the Supreme Court, the Administrative Judge shall assign the Superior judges among the units and divisions of the Superior Court. The Administrative Judge shall assign a presiding judge to each unit and may assign a judge to preside in more than one unit. In a case where a Superior judge is disqualified or unable to attend any term of court or part thereof to which he or she has been assigned, the Administrative Judge may assign another Superior judge to act as judge at that term or part thereof for that period during which the assigned judge is disqualified or unable to attend. If during a term of the Superior Court the court in a unit is unable to complete all or part of the work before it in a reasonable time, the Administrative Judge, with the approval of the Supreme Court, may modify judge assignments to reduce delays in that unit. The court shall publish the judicial rotation schedule in electronic format and distribute it electronically to attorneys licensed in Vermont.

       As necessary to ensure the efficient operation of the Superior Court, the presiding judge of the unit may specially assign a Superior judge assigned to a division in the unit, including the presiding judge, to preside over one or more cases in a different division. As the Administrative Judge determines necessary for the operation of the Superior Court throughout the State, and with the approval of the Supreme Court, the Administrative Judge may additionally assign for a specified period of time a Superior judge to preside over a particular type of case, or over a particular type of motion or other judicial proceeding, in all or part of the units in the State.

        Where defendant failed to timely object to allegedly improper participation of assistant judges in action pertaining to dissolution of a partnership and upon objection, assistant judges were excused from proceedings, the participation of the assistant judges did not provide grounds for a new trial.

        Compliance with subsection (a) of this section, governing composition of Superior courts, was a jurisdictional prerequisite to the hearing of any case, and absent such compliance, the Superior Court had no authority to hear and decide a matter.

        Where during trial one of the assistant judges suffered a stroke which rendered him incapable of continuing his duties, and the presiding judge, acting pursuant to an internal administrative directive that had no force of law, dismissed the remaining assistant judge and proceeded with the trial, since the court was not properly constituted, a mistrial had to be declared. Vermont Union School District No. 21 v. H. P. Cummings Construction Co., 143 Vt. 416, 469 A.2d 742 (1983).

       <p>
        Absent compliance with provisions of subsection (a) of this section and section 112 of this title dealing with the requirements as to composition of Superior courts for the trial of cases, a Superior Court had no authority to hear and decide a matter, and the orders of such a court were without basis in law and void. Bennett Estate v. Travelers Insurance Co., 140 Vt. 339, 438 A.2d 380 (1981), overruled on other grounds, Bevins v. King (1987) 147 Vt. 645, 513 A.2d 41 (mem.)

        Judgment would be vacated where, on second day of two day trial in which resolution of principal issue depended to a large degree on the facts, there was no court sitting as the presiding judge was present, an assistant judge was not present and this section required presence of assistant judge.

        In a hearing on damages in a negligence case, where both of the assistant judges participated, a quorum essential to decision was present and the Superior Court had authority to hear the matter and return findings. Bennett Estate v. Travelers Insurance Co., 140 Vt. 339, 438 A.2d 380 (1981), overruled on other grounds, Bevins v. King (1987) 147 Vt. 645, 513 A.2d 41 (mem.)

        Only findings and orders of a majority of members of county court who participate in trial have any force and effect, and these alone are to be treated as judicial action of court under this section. Labor v. Carpenter, 102 Vt. 418, 148 A. 867 (1930).

        Where due to the unavailability of an assistant judge plaintiff's action to recover damages for injuries allegedly received in a car accident was tried before a jury with a court consisting of one presiding judge and one assistant judge, and after judgment was entered for defendant plaintiff filed a motion for new trial, claiming that the evidence was insufficient to support the verdict, since the presiding judge viewed the motion as involving a mixed question of fact and law, participation of the assistant judge in the resolution of plaintiff's motion was proper.

        Trial court consisting of a presiding judge, sitting alone, was properly constituted, under the doctrine of presumptive regularity, even though trial transcript did not indicate that unavailability of assistant judges in courthouse was determined. Brennen v. Mogul Corp., 151 Vt. 91, 557 A.2d 870 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Superior Court consisting of presiding judge alone was without jurisdiction to consider motion for reduction of sentence where the record did not indicate on its face that both assistant judges were unavailable; assumption that because the assistant judges who sat at defendant's trial had retired, no other assistant judges could become available for further hearings in the case, was without authority. State v. Messier, 148 Vt. 392, 533 A.2d 1192 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Unavailability of an assistant judge is factual absence as opposed to legal disqualification. Furno v. Pignona, 147 Vt. 538, 522 A.2d 746 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jurisdiction of the Superior Court was not established at sentencing proceeding, where the record and the findings of the presiding judge were inadequate to explain the absence of assistant judges. In re Foy, 147 Vt. 648, 518 A.2d 372 (mem.) (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that Superior Court judge sat alone when he heard husband's motion to dismiss and wife's motion to amend the complaint in divorce action did not mean that the court was not statutorily constituted where the order denying the motion to dismiss stated that assistant judges were not available and the order granting the motion to amend was signed by the presiding judge and two assistant judges. Ragosta v. Ragosta, 143 Vt. 107, 465 A.2d 228 (1983).

        In an action under Rule 60(b)(6) to reopen a divorce case based on plaintiff's claim that the settlement agreement incorporated into the final divorce order was unconscionable, assistant judges were not entitled to make controlling determinations as to whether the separation agreement was unconscionable and whether the motion was filed within a reasonable time.

        Assistant judges in parentage action lacked authority to award custody and their order awarding custody to father was a nullity, where conclusions to be drawn from the facts found were conclusions of law which were to be decided by the presiding judge.

        Trial court was at all times properly constituted and judgment was not void because two assistant judges, who heard only first of two days of evidence, signed findings and conclusions; assistant judges were unavailable on second day, there was no evidence their signing was anything but oversight, and their signatures were mere surplusage as presiding judge's signature alone would have been sufficient.

        Although the family court has exclusive jurisdiction over divorce proceedings, there is no provision in the family court's jurisdiction for the separation of unmarried parties; thus, to the extent that parties negotiated for themselves an agreement on support and property division, that agreement was enforceable through civil action in the Superior Court.

        In a family dispute over stock, a son was not improperly allowed to "split" his claim for dividends, as the issue of dividends was not within the scope of the agreed-upon arbitration, and the trial court had not decided this issue as part of the parents' challenge to the arbitration award. Instead, following the trial court's confirmation of the arbitration award, the son filed a statement of claim, to which the parents filed an answer and a counterclaim; thus, the trial court plainly had subject matter jurisdiction.

       <p>
        The mere participation of assistant judges in criminal cases which involve legal questions, questions of mixed law and fact, or by extension, questions calling for the exercise of judicial discretion, does not initially deprive a Superior Court of its jurisdiction under this section to hear the case.

       </p>
       <p>
        Although in a criminal case participation of assistant judges in decisions involving questions of pure law, or the application of law to findings of fact, would be improper, the basis for this fatal flaw would be a deprivation of constitutional due process and the right to counsel, not that the court lacked jurisdiction to reach those questions.

     <p>
      The Superior Court shall operate continuously irrespective of the term in which events occur. Terms are designated for purposes of determining the rotation schedule of Superior judges and the responsibility of a Superior judge once a term has expired. When at the expiration of a term a Superior judge is no longer assigned to a specified unit, the judge shall complete any matters that have been heard or taken under advisement for that unit. The Administrative Judge, pursuant to rules of the Supreme Court, may specially assign a Superior judge to continue to preside over one or more cases even though the judge is no longer assigned to the unit of origin of the case or cases. In the absence of such a direction or of an assignment made pursuant to subsection 73(c) of this title, a judge who at the end of a term is no longer assigned to a unit shall have no further responsibility for cases in that unit.

         1. Constitutionality.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Legislature has power to determine number of and time for holding regular terms of the courts and to provide for special terms, the ordering of the same, and the nature of the business to be transacted thereat, since the only constitutional provisions regarding that matter are those requiring courts to be maintained in every county in the state, and providing that justice shall be impartially administered therein without corruption or unnecessary delay. State v. Alfred, 87 Vt. 157, 88 A. 534 (1913).
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislature had power to enact this section, giving presiding judge of a county court authority to call a special term thereof for trial of criminal cases. State v. Alfred, 87 Vt. 157, 88 A. 534 (1913).

         2. Public hearing.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where order for a special term of county court was made at request of state's attorney representing interests of the state, the question of necessity of notice to the public, giving opportunity to be heard on question of making the order, could not be raised. State v. Alfred, 87 Vt. 157, 88 A. 534 (1913).

         3. Order.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Filing of order calling a special term of county court was sufficient notice to all parties, and any form of order clearly indicating the purpose of the presiding judge to order such a term to be held at a designated time was sufficient. State v. Alfred, 87 Vt. 157, 88 A. 534 (1913).
       </p>
       <p>
        If presiding judge was within the state when he called a special session, he had jurisdiction to do so, regardless of whether he was then in the particular county. State v. Alfred, 87 Vt. 157, 88 A. 534 (1913).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that presiding judge was unable to be present at opening of a special term of a county court did not invalidate the term, where assistant judges opened the court and adjourned it from time to time. State v. Alfred, 87 Vt. 157, 88 A. 534 (1913).

     <p>
      The powers and jurisdiction of the courts that were heretofore vested in the courts of chancery are vested in the Superior Court. Superior, Environmental, and Probate judges have the powers of a chancellor in passing upon all civil matters which may come before them.

        Decision of the Supreme Court holding that participation of assistant judges in equity actions required new trial, rendered after hearing in dissolution of partnership proceedings in which assistant judges participated, did not provide grounds for reversal. Neel v. Sun, 156 Vt. 239, 590 A.2d 887 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court which consisted of presiding judge and two assistant judges had jurisdiction to hear equitable matters where the case was tried before December 12, 1983, the date of the Supreme Court's decision in Soucy v. Soucy Motors, Inc. 143 Vt. 615, 471 A.2d 224 (1983). Brown v. Whitcomb, 150 Vt. 106, 550 A.2d 1 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        A Superior Court constituted with one presiding judge and two assistant judges is without jurisdiction to hear a case sounding in equity; only a court with a presiding judge sitting alone has such power. Pockette v. LaDuke, 139 Vt. 625, 432 A.2d 1191 (1981); Soucy v. Soucy Motors, Inc., 143 Vt. 615, 471 A.2d 224 (1983).

       <p>
        Act which provided that no court could set aside any judgment, decree or order entered before December 12, 1983, by the Superior Court on the grounds that the participation or nonparticipation of assistant judges was improper constituted a retroactive limitation of the Court's jurisdiction over cases that had been commenced prior to the enactment of the act and was unconstitutional because it violated the separation of powers principle embodied in chapter II, section 5 of the Vermont Constitution. Solomon v. Atlantis Development, Inc., 145 Vt. 70, 483 A.2d 253 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since a petition which asked the Superior Court for a declaration on the validity of decedent's marriage also asked for a declaration on the validity of a trust amendment executed by decedent, thereby invoking the equitable jurisdiction of the court, and the court that sat and heard the petition and that signed the findings, conclusions and judgment was comprised of the presiding judge and one assistant judge, the court was without jurisdiction to hear the matter in equity and its judgment would be reversed and remanded. Melen v. First Vermont Bank & Trust Co., 144 Vt. 226, 475 A.2d 237 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the record clearly shows that assistant judges actively participated in the hearing and in the making of the findings of fact in a case involving a claim for equitable relief, that would be reversible error. Braun v. Humiston, 140 Vt. 302, 437 A.2d 1388 (1981), overruled on other grounds, Soucy v. Soucy Motors, Inc. (1983) 143 Vt. 615, 471 A.2d 224.

        Where defendant failed to timely object to allegedly improper participation of assistant judges in action pertaining to dissolution of a partnership and, upon objection, assistant judges were excused from proceedings, the participation of the assistant judges did not provide grounds for a new trial. Neel v. Sun, 156 Vt. 239, 590 A.2d 887 (1991).

       <p>
        Where Soucy v. Soucy Motors, Inc., 143 Vt. 615, 471 A.2d 224 (1983), which overruled several decisions that had held that the presence of assistant judges in cases involving equity was harmless error if the assistant judges did not participate in the cases or affect the outcomes, clearly established a new principle of law, and if it were applied retroactively, any case ever decided by an improperly constituted court would be void and would have to be vacated if one of the parties so moved, Soucy would be applied prospectively only.

    <p>
     "(c) On February 1, 2011, the probate court shall be redesignated as the probate division of the superior court, and all cases and files of the former probate court shall be transferred to the probate division of the superior court.

    <p>
     "(f) Sec. 17 of this act shall establish probate districts for the November 2, 2010 probate judge election, and for all probate judge elections thereafter.
    Probate judges in office upon passage of this act shall continue to serve, and probate districts in effect upon passage of this act shall continue to exist, until February 1, 2011.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(g) On the effective date of this subsection, the newly consolidated probate court district within each county is deemed to be a continuation of the prior probate court districts within the county.
    The newly consolidated court shall have jurisdiction over all proceedings, records, orders, decrees, judgments and other acts of the probate courts of the prior probate districts within the county, including all pending matters and appeals.
    The records of the prior probate court districts shall become the records of the probate court of the newly consolidated probate district.
    The newly consolidated probate court district shall have full authority to do all acts concerning all such proceedings and other matters as if they had originated in that court.
    The current probate registers of the prior probate districts shall be allowed to maintain their employment status that was in effect on January 31, 2011 for six months, at which time the court administrator, in consultation with the probate judge, shall appoint a single probate register for the district.
    The assistant judges of these counties shall maintain offices for the newly formed district in the former districts which may be used by the probate court full
    or part time to provide access to probate services.
    The judge of the newly formed district with the approval of the court administrator shall establish the hours of operation and staffing for each office."

        Wife's alleged misuse of the funds in a Vermont Uniform Gift to Minors Act (VUGMA) account did not transform the child's property into the property of her parents. To the extent that wife violated her obligations as custodian on the account, the VUGMA provides a different remedy in a different forum. Wade v. Wade, 178 Vt. 189, 878 A.2d 303 (July 1, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        By this section, probate courts are clothed with original and plenary jurisdiction over settlement of estates of deceased persons, and, subject to right of heirs and beneficiaries to pay debts and divide property between themselves without intervention of court, this jurisdiction is exclusive. In re Fisher's Estate, 104 Vt. 37, 156 A. 878 (1931).

       <p>
        Jurisdiction of probate court over settlement of estates of deceased persons is not lost by lapse of time, or by court's inactivity, or otherwise, and continues until work is completed by final decree. In re Fisher's Estate, 104 Vt. 37, 156 A. 878 (1931).

         3. Action against executor or administrator.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The fact that the probate court is given plenary and exclusive jurisdiction in the matter of settlement of estates does not mean that no action can be brought in other courts against an executor or administrator. Kreichman v. Webster, 110 Vt. 105, 2 A.2d 199 (1938).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where claim had been presented to commissioners, there was an appeal, and it was ultimately decided that suit could not be maintained because of nonjoinder of parties, county court had no jurisdiction of same cause of action brought directly to it against administrators and after commission on estate had closed. Goff v. Robinson, 60 Vt. 633, 15 A. 339 (1888).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mere neglect of administratrix to inventory choses in action, or to account for them in settlement of her administration account, had she made the settlement, would not give a common law court original jurisdiction in suit against administratrix upon claim which accrued in the lifetime of the intestate, but the jurisdiction would still be in probate court. Boyden v. Ward, 38 Vt. 628 (1866).

         4. Equity jurisdiction.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Probate court is given plenary and exclusive jurisdiction in matter of settlement of estates, and jurisdiction of court of chancery in such matters is not original but special and limited, and only in aid of probate court when powers of that court are inadequate. Domestic & Foreign Missionary Society v. Eells, 68 Vt. 497, 35 A. 463 (1896); Harris v. Harris, 79 Vt. 22, 64 A. 75 (1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        Equity has no jurisdiction to establish a suppressed, destroyed or spoliated will, for probate court has exclusive jurisdiction of probate of wills. Domestic & Foreign Missionary Society v. Eells, 68 Vt. 497, 35 A. 463 (1896).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an executrix settled her final account in the probate court, but made no return of certain property belonging to the estate, equity had no jurisdiction in a suit brought after her death, for the probate court could grant complete relief. Davis v. Eastman, 66 Vt. 651, 30 A. 1 (1894).

         5. Property ownership.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Whether the determination of property ownership is necessary and incidental to matters within the probate court's jurisdiction depends upon the relationship of the parties to the estate. The general rule is that the probate court is without power to decide a disputed claim between an estate and a stranger thereto, a "stranger" being generally defined as a person or entity that is not an heir or beneficiary under the will. Where, therefore, a stated beneficiary on a credit union designation-of-beneficiary card was also, as nephew of the decedent, a beneficiary under the will, he was not a stranger to the estate, and the probate court could determine whether he or the estate was entitled to the credit union account. In re Estate of Piche, 166 Vt. 479, 697 A.2d 674 (1997).

        The purpose of this section is to ensure that matters requiring immediate handling receive the necessary attention. Scrivens v. Elizabeth Lund Home, 138 Vt. 593, 421 A.2d 1276 (1980).

       <p>
        Provision stating that when a probate judge is incapacitated, his or her duties may be performed during the period of incapacity by either the register of probate, a probate judge from another district, or an assistant judge of the Superior Court in the same district has no bearing on Vermont's judicial resign-to-run provision. That an assistant judge may temporarily perform the duties of a probate judge does not affect the clear import of the resign-to-run provision, which is concerned with the broader implications of running for one judicial office while performing the duties of another. In re Hodgdon, 189 Vt. 265, 19 A.3d 598 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        The word "absence" in this section does not mean mere physical nonpresence, but rather effective absence, and a register may only perform the probate judge's duties if the judge is away from court, cannot be reached, and the situation demands immediate attention. Scrivens v. Elizabeth Lund Home, 138 Vt. 593, 421 A.2d 1276 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vacationing at a summer home within the same probate district is not "absence" for purposes of this section. Scrivens v. Elizabeth Lund Home, 138 Vt. 593, 421 A.2d 1276 (1980).

       <p>
        While probate judge has authority to pass on question of his disqualification in first instance, his decision is not final as there is right of appeal from it to county (Superior) court or, if only a question of law is involved, directly to Supreme Court.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Until there has been a disqualification of a probate judge no person named in this section to perform duties of judge in event of his disqualification would have authority to perform such duties. Ricci v. Bove's Administrator, 116 Vt. 406, 78 A.2d 13 (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jurisdiction of probate judge while acting in another district owing to disqualification of judge of that district is coextensive with the disqualification of such judge extending only to question which the judge of that district was disqualified to hear and decide. In re Estate of Prouty, 107 Vt. 504, 181 A. 138 (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        On petition to correct orders of allowance to widow made by probate judge, disqualified by reason of his having made such orders, judge from another district was confined in his jurisdiction to question whether orders should be corrected and did not have jurisdiction sua sponte to raise and decide question whether such orders were void in part by reason of having been made without giving notice and opportunity to be heard to creditors, or have jurisdiction to annul and void such orders. In re Estate of Prouty, 107 Vt. 504, 181 A. 138 (1935).

        There is a distinction between rendition of a judgment and its entry: rendition is the judicial act of the court and entry is the ministerial act of the clerk and is merely the record and evidence of what has been adjudicated.

       <p>
        Probate judge could imprison executor who willfully refused to perform order to pay monthly certain sums of money for maintenance of widow and children during settlement of estate. Leach v. Peabody, 58 Vt. 485, 2 A. 737 (1886).
       </p>
       <p>
        Probate court had no authority to imprison administrator for purpose of enforcing final decree for mere payment of money, and he was entitled to be discharged on habeas corpus. In re Bingham, 32 Vt. 329 (1859).
       </p>
       <p>
        Decree against administrator, who had been discharged and had settled his account, to pay over to his successor balance of money found due from him to intestate, such money having been received by him for sale of personal and use of real estate of intestate, was not such a specific decree as could be enforced by probate court by imprisonment. In re Bingham, 32 Vt. 329 (1859).

        When, after decree of distribution, executor neglects and refuses to pay over legacy to residuary legatee, latter may bring action of contract in nature of debt on decree for its recovery, but being final and not administrative decree, may not proceed against him in probate court under this section.

      1. Equitable adoption.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     The Superior Court was without authority to consider the visitation petition of plaintiff, the female partner of a child's adoptive mother, as it was without equitable powers to adjudicate a dispute that could not be brought in statutory proceedings within the family court's jurisdiction, there being no public policy considerations which compelled a judicially created right of equitable adoption. Were such a right created, it would establish, in effect, a two-tiered system in which persons who could not bring their visitation and custody petitions in statutory proceedings before the family court would turn to the Superior Court for relief. The Legislature did not contemplate such a system, and the law does not compel it. Titchenal v. Dexter, 166 Vt. 373, 693 A.2d 682 (1997).

        Although an addendum to a separation agreement was not presented to the divorce court, it was an agreement intended to settle the divorce proceedings. Thus, the Family Court had jurisdiction to determine its validity. Quinn v. Schipper, 180 Vt. 572, 908 A.2d 413 (mem.) (June 8, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the Family Court has exclusive jurisdiction over divorce proceedings, there is no provision in the Family Court's jurisdiction for the separation of unmarried parties; thus, to the extent that parties negotiated for themselves an agreement on support and property division, that agreement was enforceable through civil action in the Superior Court.

        Where nothing in the parties' stipulation, or the final divorce order, granted plaintiff the right to collect the entire sum of maintenance from a trust account all at once, the Family Court had jurisdiction to bar plaintiff's attempt to use an account control agreement in a manner contrary to the final order.

        By invoking the exhaustion doctrine, the Family Court assumed, incorrectly, that it had appellate jurisdiction to review the actions of the Commissioner of Mental Health and Mental Retardation. In re R.L., 163 Vt. 168, 657 A.2d 180 (1995).

       Application.
    
    This section shall apply in all proceedings in which the Family Court consists of one presiding judge and two assistant judges.
      </li>
      <li id="t04c10sub01s457ol1b">
       Questions of law and fact.
    
    In all proceedings, questions of law shall be decided by the presiding judge.
    Mixed questions of law and fact shall be deemed to be questions of law.
    The presiding judge alone shall decide which are questions of law, questions of fact, and mixed questions of law and fact. Written or oral stipulations of fact submitted by the parties shall establish the facts related therein, except that the presiding judge, in his or her discretion, may order a hearing on any stipulated fact.
    Neither the decision of the presiding judge under this subsection nor participation by an assistant judge in a ruling of law shall be grounds for reversal unless a party makes a timely objection and raises the issue on appeal.
      </li>
      <li id="t04c10sub01s457ol1c">
       Availability of assistant judges.
    
    If two assistant judges are not available, the court shall consist of one presiding judge and one assistant judge.
    If neither assistant judge is available, the court shall consist of the presiding judge alone, and the unavailability of an assistant judge shall not constitute reversible error.
      </li>
      <li id="t04c10sub01s457ol1d">
       Mistrial.
    
    In the event that court is being held by the presiding judge and one assistant judge, and they do not agree on a decision, a mistrial shall be declared.
    If the case is retried, the court shall consist of the presiding judge alone or the presiding judge and two assistant judges.
      </li>
      <li id="t04c10sub01s457ol1e">
       Method of determining availability.
    
    Before commencing a hearing in any matter in which the court by law may consist of the presiding judge and assistant judges, the assistant judges shall determine whether they are available for the case.
    A schedule of proceedings in Family Court in which the assistant judges by law may participate shall be made available sufficiently in advance to give assistant judges reasonable opportunity to determine in which cases they will participate.
    If two or more cases are being heard at one time, and assistant judges may by law participate in either, each assistant judge may determine in which case he or she will participate.
      </li>
      <li id="t04c10sub01s457ol1f">
       Duty to complete hearing or trial.
    
    After an assistant judge has decided to participate in a hearing or trial, the assistant judge shall not withdraw therefrom except for cause.
    However, if an assistant judge is not available for a scheduled hearing or trial or becomes unavailable during trial, the matter may continue without that assistant judge's participation, and he or she may not return to participate.
      </li>
      <li id="t04c10sub01s457ol1g">
       Emergency relief.
    
    A presiding judge may hear a petition for emergency relief when the court is not sitting, and may issue temporary orders as necessary.

        Presiding judge of family court erred by striking the court's prior decision to deny father's motion to modify parental rights and responsibilities because that decision was a valid, final order, and as such, father's failure to appeal the decision barred the court from issuing an order for retrial.

        In a divorce action, the court, noting that the parties had not presented sufficient evidence to calculate child support amount based on the statutory guidelines, estimated a monthly support amount of $1500, and invited the parties, if they wished to litigate the issue, to request a hearing before the magistrate. Although unusual, the court's order was reasonable under the circumstances. The $1500 estimate was not significantly higher than the $1350 per month set in a temporary order; moreover, the court may have believed that the parties would prefer to accept the estimate rather than engage in another expensive legal dispute. Cabot v. Cabot, 166 Vt. 485, 697 A.2d 644 (1997).

        Nothing in the language of the statute regarding magistrates' findings and of the statute regarding temporary relief in divorce proceedings suggests that findings or conclusions of a magistrate in a temporary order are binding upon the family court when it makes a final determination. Thus, there was no merit to a mother's argument that the trial court was bound by the findings of a temporary order. Frazer v. Olson, 200 Vt. 13, 127 A.3d 86 (2015).

     </h3>
     <p>
      Upon motion of either party, upon motion of the magistrate, or upon the court's own motion, a judge of the Family Division of the Superior Court may hear and determine the issue of child support, provided there is a prior existing support order in effect or an interim or temporary order and the court finds one of the following:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t04c10sub02s463ol11">
       The support matter is so intrinsically tied to an action that must be heard by a judge that hearing before a magistrate would unduly delay the proceedings.
      </li>
      <li id="t04c10sub02s463ol12">
       The identity of the parties, issues, and evidence are so similar in nature that consolidation with an already scheduled matter would in fact expedite resolution of the support issue.
      </li>
      <li id="t04c10sub02s463ol13">
       A material legal issue must be resolved for which there is no legal precedent.

       Such good and substantial cause as the court may find, consistent with the principle that support cases shall be heard in a timely manner.

        Statute and rule governing appeals from magistrates' orders in family proceedings do not allow an appeal of a magistrate's remanded order directly to the Vermont Supreme Court without first appealing to the Superior Court. Any order of the magistrate is appealable under the statute to the family court, not to the Supreme Court. Patnode v. Urette, 196 Vt. 416, 98 A.3d 787 (2014).

        Vermont Supreme Court could not address either the Superior Court's remanding the issue of child support to a magistrate or the magistrate's subsequent order on remand. The magistrate's order had not been properly appealed through the Superior Court, and the Superior Court order was not a final appealable order because it remanded the issue of child support back to the magistrate.

        The Vermont Statutes Annotated provide that whenever a vacancy occurs in the office of a Supreme Court Justice or when an incumbent does not declare that he or she will be a candidate to succeed himself or herself, the Judicial Nominating Board shall submit to the Governor the names of as many persons as it deems well qualified to be appointed to the office. This provision cannot expand the Governor's power beyond that established in the Constitution. Turner v. Shumlin, 204 Vt. 78, 163 A.3d 1173 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Use of the word "or" in the statute governing judicial nominations and appointments indicates that an incumbent not declaring for retention is distinct from the creation of a vacancy. The statute does not confer any power on the Governor; rather, it merely allows the Judicial Nominating Board, in anticipation of an expected vacancy, to submit the names of candidates to the Governor, nothing more. Turner v. Shumlin, 204 Vt. 78, 163 A.3d 1173 (2017).

        A court can temporarily seal an affidavit of probable cause upon a preliminary examination of the likelihood of adverse publicity and its potential effect on the accused's right to a fair trial; however, such an order must be carefully drawn to afford the maximum recognition of the rights of both the defendant and the public.

         3. Access to records.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        This section does not merely describe record-keeping duties of the clerk, but rather provides an affirmative right of public access to court records. In re Sealed Documents, 172 Vt. 152, 772 A.2d 518 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Documents upon which a court bases a decision to issue a search warrant, which are filed with the court, and which become part of the case record subject to disclosure in connection with subsequent motions for return of property or suppression of evidence, must be considered part of the "records of the court"; accordingly, interested persons would be entitled to examine search warrants and related materials that have been executed and returned to the court absent any superseding legal requirement that they be kept confidential. In re Sealed Documents, 172 Vt. 152, 772 A.2d 518 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section preserves common-law exceptions to the presumptive right to examine court records. In re Sealed Documents, 172 Vt. 152, 772 A.2d 518 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Presumptive right of access to court records, including pre-indictment search warrant materials, may be overcome only by showing that a substantial threat exists to the interests of effective law enforcement, or individual privacy and safety. In re Sealed Documents, 172 Vt. 152, 772 A.2d 518 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to overcome the presumptive right of access to court records, the requisite showing of harm must be demonstrated with specificity as to each document; general allegations of harm are insufficient. In re Sealed Documents, 172 Vt. 152, 772 A.2d 518 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Secrecy of court records should extend no further than necessary to protect the interests in confidentiality; thus, trial court must determine whether these interests might be served by deletion of the harmful material. In re Sealed Documents, 172 Vt. 152, 772 A.2d 518 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        In rendering decision on sealing court records, trial court must examine each document individually, and make fact-specific findings with regard to why the presumption of access has been overcome. In re Sealed Documents, 172 Vt. 152, 772 A.2d 518 (2001).

        There was no probable cause to charge defendant, a "jailhouse lawyer" who gave legal advice to, and drafted motions for, fellow inmates, with the unauthorized practice of law and with criminal contempt. Such inmates might perform a valuable service in promoting more meaningful access to justice than their fellow inmates would otherwise enjoy; furthermore, defendant received no payment for her services, and the pleadings or motions she drafted were reviewed and signed by the inmates she was helping.

     <p>
      When an attorney is required to attend more than one trial, hearing, or other proceeding before a court or commission having judicial or quasi-judicial functions, or both, at times which conflict so that he or she cannot reasonably attend each appointment, the attorney may request the Administrative Judge to designate which appointment he or she shall attend.
    The Administrative Judge shall designate the appointment the attorney shall attend and shall notify the presiding magistrate of each court and commission of his or her decision.
    The attorney shall be excused from attending at that time any proceedings other than the one designated by the Administrative Judge, and the other proceedings shall be rescheduled.

        Engagement of counsel in other trial courts will not be considered cause for an automatic continuance or a ground for finding a court in abuse of discretion for dismissing the proceeding; counsel has burden of resolving appointment conflicts.

        Where counsel received notice of date of drawing of jury and advised deputy clerk of court that he had two administrative hearings already scheduled for that date, and counsel failed to move for continuance, or use statutory procedure for resolution of appointment conflicts, and court dismissed the proceeding with prejudice, the judgment would stand on appeal to Supreme Court.
