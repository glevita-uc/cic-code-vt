   2007, 192 (Adj. Sess.),
   §
   5.304.2(a) provides: "It is the intent of the general assembly that, after June 30, 2010, any education funds paid to teen parent education programs for educational services provided to pregnant or parenting teens shall be available only to those programs that the state board of education has determined to be 'approved education programs' under Title 16."

    Legislative intent.
   </b>
   <cite class="vt-code">2007, No. 154</cite> (Adj. Sess.),
   
    §
   
   1 provides: "It is the intent of Secs. 1-3 of this act to enhance the ability of regional technical centers and secondary schools in Vermont to teach and prepare students for careers in agriculture, forestry, and horticulture and to determine what steps are necessary to prepare the next generation for involvement in these sectors of Vermont's economy."

  </p>
  <p>
   <b>
    Legislative policy, findings, and purpose.
   </b>
   <cite class="vt-code">2009, No. 38</cite>,
   
    §
   
   1 provides: "(a) It is the policy of the state of Vermont to make available as many opportunities as possible for Vermont students to succeed in their Pre-K-12 education, to encourage and facilitate high school students to progress toward higher education, and to prepare postsecondary students to succeed.
  </p>
  <p>
   "(b) Completing high school cannot be considered the minimum educational attainment. As stated by President Obama in his address before Congress on February 24, 2009, every American should 'commit to at least one year or more of higher education or career training. This can be community college or a four-year school; vocational training or an apprenticeship. But whatever the training may be, every American will need to get more than a high school diploma. And dropping out of high school is no longer an option. It's not just quitting on yourself, it's quitting on your country - and this country needs and values the talents of every American. That is why we will provide the support necessary to .
   .
   .
   meet a new goal: By 2020, America will once again have the highest proportion of college graduates in the world.'
  </p>
  <p>
   "(c) For Vermont to thrive economically it must develop, attract, and retain a well-educated and highly skilled citizenry, who will in turn enable the development, recruitment, and retention of successful businesses and support healthy communities.
  </p>
  <p>
   "(d) Higher levels of educational attainment translate into higher earnings and tax revenues, increased civic engagement and community contributions, better overall health, decreased dependency on government services, and an improved quality of life.
  </p>
  <p>
   "(e) To increase educational attainment among Vermonters, educational partnerships between higher education and the Pre-K-12 educational system are crucial to increasing postsecondary aspirations, increasing the enrollment of Vermont high school graduates in higher education programs, increasing the postsecondary degree completion rates of Vermont students, and increasing public awareness of the economic, intellectual, and societal benefits of higher education.
  </p>
  <p>
   "(f) To track student performance throughout a student's academic career and to understand better the programs and services that increase educational attainment and reduce performance disparities between students of different socioeconomic backgrounds, it is essential that Vermont implement a statewide Pre-K-12 longitudinal data system."

       § 1. Right to equal educational opportunity.
       <br/>
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The right to public education is integral to Vermont's constitutional form of government and its guarantees of political and civil rights. Further, the right to education is fundamental for the success of Vermont's children in a rapidly-changing society and global marketplace as well as for the State's own economic and social prosperity. To keep Vermont's democracy competitive and thriving, Vermont students must be afforded substantially equal access to a quality basic education. However, one of the strengths of Vermont's education system lies in its rich diversity and the ability for each local school district to adapt its educational program to local needs and desires. Therefore, it is the policy of the State that all Vermont children will be afforded educational opportunities that are substantially equal although educational programs may vary from district to district.

The commissioner shall compile the information and make it available to schools throughout the state either on the department's website or in another form in a format he or she determines to be most appropriate.

    165 authorizes the commissioner of education to determine how well schools and students are meeting state standards every two years and to impose certain consequences if schools are failing to meet standards after specific time periods. Notwithstanding the provisions of that section, in order to comply with the provisions of Public Law 107-110, known as the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, as amended from time to time (the 'Act'), while it is in effect, the commissioner is authorized to determine whether schools and school districts are meeting state standards annually and the state board of education is authorized to impose on schools and school districts consequences allowed in state law and required by the Act within the time frame required in the Act. However, consistent with Title IX, Part E, Subpart 2, Sec. 9527 of the No Child Left Behind Act, neither the state nor any subdivision thereof shall be required to spend any funds or incur any costs not paid for under the Act in order to comply with the provisions of the Act. The state or any subdivision thereof may expend other funds for activities they were already conducting consistent with the Act, or for activities authorized in a state or local fiscal year 2004 budget. It is the intent of the general assembly to continue to study the provisions of the federal law and to seek guidance from the federal government in order to determine permanent changes to Title 16 that will be necessary to comply with federal law and to avoid having federal law cause state and local governments to absorb the cost of unfunded mandates."

    On application, the State Board shall approve an independent school that offers elementary or secondary education if it finds, after opportunity for hearing, that the school provides a minimum course of study pursuant to section 906 of this title and that it substantially complies with the Board's rules for approved independent schools. Except as provided in subdivision (6) of this subsection, the Board's rules must at minimum require that the school have the resources required to meet its stated objectives, including financial capacity, faculty who are qualified by training and experience in the areas in which they are assigned, and physical facilities and special services that are in accordance with any State or federal law or regulation. Approval may be granted without State Board evaluation in the case of any school accredited by a private, State, or regional agency recognized by the State Board for accrediting purposes.

      Subsection (b ) effective July 1, 2023; see also subsection (b) effective until July 1, 2023 set out above.
      On application, the State Board shall approve an independent school that offers elementary or secondary education if it finds, after opportunity for hearing, that the school provides a minimum course of study pursuant to section 906 of this title and that it substantially complies with all statutory requirements for approved independent schools and the Board's rules for approved independent schools. An independent school that intends to accept public tuition shall be approved by the State Board only on the condition that the school agrees, notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, to enroll any student who requires special education services and who is placed in or referred to the approved independent school as an appropriate placement and least restrictive environment for the student by the student's individualized education program team or by the local education agency; provided, however, that this requirement shall not apply to an independent school that limits enrollment to students who are on an individualized education program or a plan under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, and who are enrolled pursuant to a written agreement between the local education agency and the school. Except as provided in subdivision (6) of this subsection, the Board's rules must at minimum require that the school have the resources required to meet its stated objectives, including financial capacity, faculty who are qualified by training and experience in the areas in which they are assigned, and physical facilities and special services that are in accordance with any State or federal law or regulation. Approval may be granted without State Board evaluation in the case of any school accredited by a private, State, or regional agency recognized by the State Board for accrediting purposes, provided that the State Board shall determine that the school complies with all student enrollment provisions required by law.
     </p>
     <p>
      (1) On application, the State Board shall approve an independent school that offers kindergarten but no other graded education if it finds, after opportunity for hearing, that the school substantially complies with the Board's rules for approved independent kindergartens. The State Board may delegate to another State agency the authority to evaluate the safety and adequacy of the buildings in which kindergartens are conducted, but shall consider all findings and recommendations of any such agency in making its approval decision.
     </p>
     <p>
      (2) Approvals under this subsection (b) shall be for a term established by rule of the Board but not greater than five years.
     </p>
     <p>
      (3) An approved independent school shall provide to the parent or guardian responsible for each of its students, prior to accepting any money for a student, an accurate statement in writing of its status under this section, and a copy of this section. Failure to comply with this provision may create a permissible inference of false advertising in violation of <cite class="vt-code">13 V.S.A. § 2005</cite>.
     </p>
     <p>
      (4) Each approved independent school shall provide to the Secretary on October 1 of each year the names, genders, dates of birth, and addresses of its enrolled students. Within seven days of the termination of a student's enrollment, the approved independent school shall notify the Secretary of the name and address of the student. The Secretary shall notify the appropriate school officials as provided in section 1126 of this title.
     </p>
     <p>
      (5) The State Board may revoke, suspend, or impose conditions upon the approval of an approved independent school, after having provided an opportunity for a hearing, for substantial failure to comply with the minimum course of study, for failure to demonstrate that the school has the resources required to meet its stated objectives, for failure to comply with statutory requirements or the Board's rules for approved independent schools, or for failure to report under subdivision (4) of this subsection (b). Upon that revocation or suspension, students required to attend school who are enrolled in that school shall become truant unless they enroll in a public school, an approved or recognized independent school, or a home study program.
     </p>
     <p>
      (6) This subdivision (6) applies to an independent school located in Vermont that offers a distance learning program and that, because of its structure, does not meet some or all the rules of the State Board for approved independent schools. In order to be approved under this subdivision, a school shall meet the standards adopted by rule of the State Board for approved independent schools that can be applied to the applicant school and any other standards or rules adopted by the State Board regarding these types of schools. A school approved under this subdivision shall not be eligible to receive tuition payments from public school districts under chapter 21 of this title.
     </p>
     <p>
      (7) Approval for independent residential schools under this subsection is also contingent upon proof of the school's satisfactory completion of an annual fire safety inspection by the Department of Public Safety or its designee pursuant to 20 V.S.A. chapter 173, subchapter 2. A certificate executed by the inspecting entity, declaring satisfactory completion of the inspection and identifying the date by which a new inspection must occur, shall be posted at the school in a public location. The school shall provide a copy of the certificate to the Secretary of Education after each annual inspection. The school shall pay the actual cost of the inspection unless waived or reduced by the inspecting entity.
     </p>
     <p>
      (8) (A) If an approved independent school experiences any of the following financial reporting events during the period of its approved status, the school shall notify the Secretary of Education within five days after its knowledge of the event unless the failure is de minimis:
     </p>
     <p>
      (B) (i) If the State Board reasonably believes that an approved independent school lacks financial capacity to meet its stated objectives during the period of its approved status, then the State Board shall notify the school in writing of the reasons for this belief and permit the school a reasonable opportunity to respond.
     </p>
     <p>
      (C) Information provided by an independent school under this subsection that is not already in the public domain is exempt from public inspection and copying under the Public Records Act and shall be kept confidential.

       Hearings before enrollment.
    
    If the Secretary has information that creates a significant doubt about whether a home study program can or will provide a minimum course of study for a student who has not yet enrolled, the Secretary may call a hearing. At the hearing, the home study program shall establish that it has complied with this section and will provide the student with a minimum course of study.

       Notice and procedure.
    
    Notice of any hearing shall include a brief summary of the material facts and shall be sent to each parent or guardian and each instructor of the student or students involved who are known to the Secretary. The hearing shall occur within 30 days of the day that notice is given or sent. If a notice concerns a child not yet enrolled in a home study program, enrollment shall not occur until an order has been issued after the hearing. The hearing shall be conducted by an impartial hearing officer appointed by the Secretary from a list approved by the State Board. At the request of the child's parent or guardian, the hearing officer shall conduct the hearing at a location in the vicinity of the home study program.

       Order following hearing.
    
    After hearing evidence, the hearing officer shall enter an order within ten working days. If the child is not enrolled, the order shall provide that the child be enrolled or that enrollment be disallowed. If the child is enrolled, the order shall provide that enrollment be continued or that the enrollment be terminated. An order shall take effect immediately. Unless the hearing officer provides for a shorter period, an order disallowing or terminating enrollment shall extend until the end of the following school year, as defined in this title. If the order is to disallow or terminate the enrollment, a copy shall be given to the appropriate superintendent of schools, who shall take appropriate action to ensure that the child is enrolled in a school as required by this title. Following a hearing, the Secretary may petition the hearing officer to reopen the case only if there has been a material change in circumstances.

       The minimum course of study required under this section shall be provided every school year, and the educational content provided shall be adapted in each area of study to the age and ability of each child and to any disability of the child.

       After the filing of the enrollment notice or at a hearing, if the home study program is unable to comply with any specific requirements due to deep religious conviction shared by an organized group, the Secretary may waive such requirements if he or she determines that the educational purposes of this section are being or will be substantially met.

       A Vermont home study program that has successfully completed the last two consecutive school years of home study with any enrolled child, provided those two years fall within the most recent five years, shall not thereafter be required to submit an annual detailed outline or narrative describing the content of the minimum course of study. For the purposes of this subsection, successful completion of a home study program shall mean that, in each of the two consecutive years, the program has not been disallowed by order of a hearing officer, the previously enrolled student made progress commensurate with age and ability in all subject areas of the minimum course of study, and the home study program has otherwise complied with the requirements of this section.

        The homestudy statute is not a penal statute to be strictly construed against the state because nothing therein empowers the Department of Education or a hearing officer to issue an order that has direct penal consequences; it simply establishes a governmental reporting requirement, much as any regulatory law. In re S.M., 175 Vt. 524, 824 A.2d 593 (mem.) (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        The home-study statute is not unconstitutionally vague on the basis that it fails to notify parents as to what is required for enrollment and permits arbitrary enforcement. In re S.M., 175 Vt. 524, 824 A.2d 593 (mem.) (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Home-study statute did not confer discretion on Commissioner of Education to "approve" a home-study program; rather, under statute, enrollment in a program occurred either immediately or within 45 days after receipt of enrollment notice, unless Commissioner ordered a hearing. In re T.M., 171 Vt. 1, 756 A.2d 793 (2000).

        Minor was properly enrolled in a home-study program under statute because Commissioner of Education failed to order hearing within 45 days of receiving mother's notice of enrollment; minor could therefore not properly be adjudicated a child in need of care and supervision on basis of truancy from school. In re T.M., 171 Vt. 1, 756 A.2d 793 (2000).

       <p>
        In order for the Commissioner of Education to fulfill the statutory duty to ensure that the home study program provides the student with a minimum course of study, the Department must be provided with sufficient information to show whether the child is handicapped; the bare, conclusory opinion of a professional is insufficient for the Commissioner to make the required determination.

       Purpose and findings.
    
    It is a goal of the General Assembly to promote quality education for every Vermont child and to create an opportunity for every Vermont student to achieve his or her personal best, while respecting divergent student goals and personal learning styles and abilities. The General Assembly finds that a school's climate for learning is improved when parents, community members, and business leaders actively participate in promoting educational opportunities for every student. Further, it is the compassion and innovation of individual teachers and school personnel that often create the impetus for students to achieve excellence in education.
      </li>
      <li id="t16p01c05sub01s215ol1b">
       The Secretary shall establish and implement a Challenge to Excellence Grant Program for the purpose of promoting quality education for Vermont students. Eligible applicants include Vermont public schools, including regional career technical centers, and Vermont supervisory unions on behalf of a school or schools. All proposals shall be to develop or carry out a comprehensive plan, which may be an action plan pursuant to subdivision 165(a)(1) of this title, to create educational opportunities for each student within the school. Any plan shall be developed with the involvement of parents and other community members, staff, and business representatives, and shall be designed to assist students in meeting State Board and school board standards. Grants shall be for up to $50,000.00 and shall include a 1-1 match from other sources of funding, including grants from businesses, foundations, or other federal or local funding. Priority shall be given to schools that the Secretary finds are having difficulty meeting the quality standards listed in subsection 165(a) of this title or are making insufficient progress in improving student performance in relation to the standards set forth in subdivision 164(9) of this title. Eligible activities include:
       <ol>
        <li id="t16p01c05sub01s215ol1b1">
         a comprehensive planning and goal-setting process to promote a quality education for all students within the school;
        </li>
        <li id="t16p01c05sub01s215ol1b2">
         activities to carry out a comprehensive plan to promote quality education for students within the school; and
        </li>
        <li id="t16p01c05sub01s215ol1b3">
         innovative methods to create educational opportunities for students according to a comprehensive plan, including special classes and activities; mentorship; summer institutes on math, science, reading and language arts, social studies, service, the arts, or technology; partnerships for learning with businesses, postsecondary schools, and community organizations; tutorials; programs for at-risk or gifted students; and guidance, peer counseling, and career planning activities.

    The school board of each school district operating a school, after recommendation by the superintendent, may designate a person as principal for each public school within the district, except that a principal may be selected to serve more than one school. In the case of a career technical center, only the school board that operates the center may designate a person as director.

       Renewal and nonrenewal.
    
    A principal who has been continuously employed for more than two years in the same position has the right either to have his or her contract renewed, or to receive written notice of nonrenewal on or before February 1 of the year in which the existing contract expires. Nonrenewal may be based upon elimination of the position, performance deficiencies, or other reasons. The written notice shall recite the grounds for nonrenewal. If nonrenewal is based on performance deficiencies, the written notice shall be accompanied by an evaluation performed by the superintendent. At its discretion, the school board may allow a period of remediation of performance deficiencies prior to issuance of the written notice. After receiving such a notice, the principal may request in writing, and shall be granted, a meeting with the school board. Such request shall be delivered within 15 days of delivery of notice of nonrenewal, and the meeting shall be held within 15 days of delivery of the request for a meeting. At the meeting, the school board shall explain its position, and the principal shall be allowed to respond. The principal and any member of the board may present written information or oral information through statements of others, and the principal and the board may be represented by counsel. The meeting shall be in executive session unless both parties agree in writing that it be open to the public. After the meeting, the school board shall decide whether or not to offer the principal an opportunity to renew his or her contract. The school board shall issue its decision in writing within five days. The decision of the school board shall be final.

       Dismissal.
    
    During the term of a contract, a principal may be dismissed by the board for just and sufficient cause by written notice setting forth the grounds therefor.
    The board may provide that its order shall take effect immediately, or following a hearing. In either case, the principal shall be given an opportunity to request in writing a hearing within the 15 days following delivery of the notice.
    Within 15 days following receipt of a request for hearing from the principal, the board shall conduct such a hearing.
    The clerk of the board shall advise the principal and the superintendent of the time and place of hearing by written notice at least five days before the date of the hearing.
    The hearing shall be in executive session unless both parties agree in writing that it be open to the public.
    The principal and any member of the board may present witnesses and written evidence and cross-examine witnesses, and the principal and the board may be represented by counsel.
    Either the principal or the school board may arrange for the taking of a verbatim record of the proceedings.
    After the hearing, the board shall affirm, modify, or reverse its earlier action.
    Within five days after the conclusion of evidence in the case, the board shall issue a written decision that includes findings of fact and conclusions of law.
    Within 30 days of the day the written decision is delivered, the principal may appeal to the Superior Court under the rules for appeals from decisions in contested cases.

        Practically speaking, a school district's course of action in placing plaintiff principal on administrative leave had the same effect as a dismissal: it ended plaintiff's employment relationship with the district in the middle of the school year. The labeling of this action as a "placement on administrative leave" instead of a "dismissal" did not exempt the district from the procedural requirements of plaintiff's contract and the statute governing dismissal of principals. Herrera v. Union No. 39 Sch. Dist., 181 Vt. 198, 917 A.2d 923 (August 4, 2006).

       <p>
        Defendant school board failed in its contention that plaintiff principal lost his opportunity to appeal the board's decision to place him on administrative leave when he did not file his appeal with the Superior Court within the thirty-day limit imposed by statute. This argument was without merit on its face, as the board did not hold a hearing as required under the statute, and thus, did not issue a written decision pursuant to that section. Herrera v. Union No. 39 Sch. Dist., 181 Vt. 198, 917 A.2d 923 (August 4, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant school district failed in its argument that the time limitations of the Vermont Rule of Civil Procedure on review of administrative actions applied to limit plaintiff principal's right to appeal the board's decision to place him on administrative leave. The pleadings contained no statute-of-limitations argument in any form, whether under the statute on dismissal or the civil rule. Thus, plaintiff's action could not be dismissed as untimely filed. Herrera v. Union No. 39 Sch. Dist., 181 Vt. 198, 917 A.2d 923 (August 4, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant school district failed in its argument that the board's meeting with plaintiff principal to deal with the subject of nonrenewal of plaintiff's contract provided plaintiff with the process he was entitled to under his contract and the statute on dismissal. A meeting on a different subject, conducted according to looser procedural requirements, measured according to a more deferential decision-making standard, and subject to less rigorous review, if any, was not sufficient to excuse the district from providing the hearing plaintiff was entitled to under his contract and the applicable statute. The district's failure to provide that hearing was a breach of plaintiff's contract. Herrera v. Union No. 39 Sch. Dist., 181 Vt. 198, 917 A.2d 923 (August 4, 2006).

        Even if a court could vacate an arbitration award on the ground that it manifestly disregarded the law, the arbitrator here had not manifestly disregarded the law, as the collective bargaining agreement contained no clear statement to the effect that acting or interim administrators were entitled to the full tenure protections of non-interim administrators and the union had not cited any controlling law establishing that the statute concerning school principals extended its job protections to people hired as acting or interim principals.

       A district may, if it so votes at its annual meeting on the first Tuesday in March, fix a different date for holding its annual meetings, provided the date is not earlier than March 15 nor later than June 30. A notice of the proposed change shall be inserted in the warning of the annual meeting upon the written request of five percent of the voters of the district. Special meetings shall be warned on the application of five percent of the voters of the district.

      <li id="t16p01c09sub02s472ol1b">
       Meetings shall be warned by the clerk or, in case of his or her inability to act, by the prudential committee, by posting a notice specifying the time, place, and business of the meeting in two public places in the district at least seven days before the date of the meeting, and warnings shall be recorded before being posted.

       When a person whose duty it is to warn a school meeting neglects to do so for ten days, after application made as provided in this section, he or she shall forfeit to the district $20.00 for each ten days' neglect, to be recovered in an action on this statute.

         1. Computation of time.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In computing length of time during which notice of meeting of school district was given, same rule would be applied, as in case of service of process; either day on which notice was posted, or day on which meeting was held, would be counted. Mason v. School District No. 14, 20 Vt. 487 (1848).
       </p>
       <p>
        Notice dated on first day of month, for meeting to be held on seventh, was not sufficient. Hunt v. School District No. 20, 14 Vt. 300 (1842).

        Warning must specify business to be transacted. Hunt v. School District No. 20, 14 Vt. 300 (1842); School District No. 4 v. School District No. 2, 64 Vt. 527, 25 A. 433 (1892); School District No. 13 v. Smith, 67 Vt. 566, 32 A. 484 (1895).

        It was no excuse for defective school district warning that similar warnings had been used for many years. Scott v. School District No. 9, 67 Vt. 150, 31 A. 145 (1894).
       </p>
       <p>
        Meeting warned without naming in warrant hour of meeting was irregular, and its proceedings were void; and defect was not cured by an adjournment to another day, naming hour of that day. Sherwin v. Bugbee, 16 Vt. 439 (1844).

         1. Constitutionality.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The current system for funding public education in Vermont is in violation of the State Constitution. A legitimate governmental purpose cannot be fathomed to justify the gross inequities in educational opportunities produced by this system, with its substantial dependence on local property taxes and resultant wide disparities in revenues available to local school districts. The distribution of a resource as precious as educational opportunity may not have as its determining force the mere fortuity of a child's residence. Brigham v. State, 166 Vt. 246, 692 A.2d 384 (1997), (decided under facts existing before 1997 amendments of Title 16).

       <p>
        Under school act of Nov. 1827, and explanatory act of 1833, voters in any school district could assess tax for support of school only on such scholars as actually attended school. Brown v. Hoadley, 12 Vt. 472 (1839).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Vote to sustain school for definite period was not equivalent to vote to defray expenses of that school by tax on grand list. Adams v. Crowell, 40 Vt. 31 (1867).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vote by school district that tax be raised to pay expenses of repairs of their school house was sufficient and valid, without limitation as to amount of tax or its rate percent. Adams v. Hyde, 27 Vt. 221 (1855).
       </p>
       <p>
        School district could raise money for building school house or supporting school only by vote of district in meeting legally warned. Chandler v. Bradish, 23 Vt. 416 (1851); Bowen v. King, 34 Vt. 156 (1861).

         4. Committee.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Committee in assessing tax had right to anticipate wants of district, and could legally assess it at reasonable time before money was required. Brock v. Bruce, 59 Vt. 313, 10 A. 93 (1887).
       </p>
       <p>
        Money borrowed by school committee without authority, but on credit, of the district, and used to supply a temporary need in paying expenses of school, could be treated as if borrowed of themselves, and as part of expenses for which tax might legally be assessed under vote of district. Brock v. Bruce, 59 Vt. 313, 10 A. 93 (1887).
       </p>
       <p>
        Issuing of one rate bill, whether valid or invalid, did not exhaust power of prudential committee, but they could legally issue another bill for same tax. Eddy v. Wilson, 43 Vt. 362 (1871).
       </p>
       <p>
        Committee appointed by school district to remove schoolhouse of district had no authority to assess tax to defray expenses of such removal, or to make out rate bill of such tax or certify to its correctness, notwithstanding money for purpose was voted by district, since prudential committee of district was alone authorized by law. Johnson v. Sanderson, 34 Vt. 94 (1861).

       <p>
        Neglect to comply with provision of statute requiring warrant for collection of school tax to specify limited time within which tax was to be collected was not defect of which person taxed could take advantage; and though it might render the warrant informal and defective as between district and collector, it did not invalidate action taken by latter to collect tax.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        It was presumed that an appropriation of public money by school district officers to pay for repairs of schoolhouse was authorized by district, when it did not appear whether it was or not. Brock v. Bruce, 59 Vt. 313, 10 A. 93 (1887).

       <p>
        Where school districts keep within limits of their corporate powers, their proceedings in raising and expending money cannot be collaterally impeached and held void because, in opinion of court and jury, less sum would have answered immediate necessities of corporation, or money might have been more judiciously and economically expended.

        Notwithstanding the fact that the voters of a union school district have the authority to approve the budget and to authorize various transactions, such as the purchase or lease of land and the borrowing of money, the broad power conferred on school directors of union school districts by the Vermont Legislature is sufficiently governmental in nature to require the application of the one person, one vote principle in the election of union school directors.

        §
        562(7) does not impliedly grant to municipalities power to borrow for period exceeding one year because although this provision expressly grants power to build schoolhouses, power to borrow is not necessary to build schoolhouses; Legislature has provided procedure by which municipalities must obtain approval from electorate for funding such improvements.

        §
        562(9) does not grant to voters power to authorize school board to borrow money for term longer than one year, provided payments on notes are made from annual revenue, because statute clearly states that notes cannot exceed anticipated annual revenue and there is no reason to construe "notes" in statute as "payment on notes."

        School board did not exceed its authority by sending letters to voters about issues to be voted on because school district had statutory duty to locate and erect schoolhouses and sending informational letters to voters, in this context, was proper function of school district.

        This section, granting to school boards the power to establish education policies and to prescribe rules and regulations for the conduct and management of schools, including student discipline, does not conflict with, and therefore give way to section 1162 of this title, the more specific statute authorizing superintendents or principals, pursuant to regulations adopted by the governing board, to suspend, dismiss or expel pupils for misconduct; the latter provision authorizes, but does not require, school boards to delegate the power to suspend or expel students.

        The Vermont Public Accommodations Act encompasses claims against school officials, as owners and operators of places of public accommodation, as well as their agents and employees, for unlawful in-school harassment of their students, even when the harassing conduct is perpetrated by other students. Washington v. Pierce, 179 Vt. 318, 895 A.2d 173 (December 16, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        A plaintiff bringing a Vermont Public Accommodations Act action based on a hostile school environment created by student-student harassment must show that: (1) he or she was the victim of harassing conduct so severe, pervasive, and objectively offensive that it deprived him or her of access to the educational opportunities or benefits provided by the school; and (2) the plaintiff exhausted the administrative remedies available, or that circumstances existed that relieved the plaintiff of the exhaustion requirement. 16 V.S.A.

         2. Exhaustion of remedies.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        University was a postsecondary school that had a harassment policy in place during all times relevant to a case brought by a student. Therefore, the exception to the exhaustion requirement for an educational institution that did not maintain a harassment policy did not apply to her harassment claim. Allen v. University of Vermont, 185 Vt. 518, 973 A.2d 1183 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statute regarding harassment and hazing prevention policies in public elementary and high school districts does not apply to college harassment policies. Even if a college student argued that the Legislature nevertheless intended the statute's response time limits to apply to all educational institutions, including postsecondary colleges, the court did not need to address such an argument given the student's failure to provide actual notice of a harassment complaint and exhaust her administrative remedies; thus, the exception to the exhaustion requirement for the lack of timely determination on a harassment complaint did not apply. Allen v. University of Vermont, 185 Vt. 518, 973 A.2d 1183 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        College student's argument that she should not have to exhaust her administrative remedies as required by statute because a university did not inform her plainly enough of her right to pursue a complaint under its harassment policy after she claimed that she was raped by a fellow student failed both as an appeal to fairness and as an invitation to rewrite the statute. Assuming, for argument's sake, that the university "dropped the ball" in failing to refer her to the officials designated to respond to harassment complaints, the student showed no prejudice that could not have been cured by filing a claim of harassment after harassment was specifically alleged in her civil lawsuit under the Vermont Public Accommodations Act; furthermore, the procedures were not hidden, and nothing suggested that the university, which responded to the rape complaint, sought to defeat or discourage a sexual harassment complaint. Allen v. University of Vermont, 185 Vt. 518, 973 A.2d 1183 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because plaintiff could not demonstrate that any of the exceptions to the requirement for exhaustion of her administrative remedies applied, and because there was no dispute that she did not even begin to engage, let alone exhaust, the school's remedial process, her Vermont Public Accommodations Act claim foundered and was properly dismissed by the Superior Court. Washington v. Pierce, 179 Vt. 318, 895 A.2d 173 (December 16, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        By choosing not to raise any complaints with a school official, plaintiff failed to exhaust her administrative remedies. Thus, her claim under the Vermont Public Accommodations Act could not survive summary judgment unless one of the exceptions to the exhaustion requirement applied. Washington v. Pierce, 179 Vt. 318, 895 A.2d 173 (December 16, 2005).

         3. Public Accommodations Act claims.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        There was no merit to the argument of a college student who claimed that she had been raped by a fellow student that the university's failure to provide her with a copy of its harassment policy precluded application of the statutory exhaustion requirement to her claim under the Vermont Public Accommodations Act (VPAA). Because she failed to notify the university of a harassment claim according to the university's policy, and thus failed to satisfy the statutory exhaustion remedy, she was precluded from initiating her discrimination claim in the Superior Court under the VPAA. Allen v. University of Vermont, 185 Vt. 518, 973 A.2d 1183 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because exhaustion of administrative remedies is a critical predicate to a Vermont Public Accommodations Act action claiming a hostile school environment based on student-to-student conduct, a university was entitled to avoid litigation by addressing duly reported harassment. That did not occur here, and thus a student who claimed harassment by a fellow student failed to demonstrate that the futility exception to the exhaustion requirement applied. Allen v. University of Vermont, 185 Vt. 518, 973 A.2d 1183 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff's Vermont Public Accommodations Act cause of action does not exist outside of the statute that makes it explicitly conditioned upon exhaustion of administrative remedies by actual notice to the designated employee, unless excused by specific statutory exceptions. Those exceptions do not recognize constructive notice to designated persons through reports to other, nondesignated employees. Allen v. University of Vermont, 185 Vt. 518, 973 A.2d 1183 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        The standard for Vermont Public Accommodations Act claims must accommodate both a student's right to be free of harassment in educational institutions, and a school's opportunity to respond to alleged harassment before being subject to litigation. Washington v. Pierce, 179 Vt. 318, 895 A.2d 173 (December 16, 2005).

       Unless the school districts that are parties to the contract have agreed upon a different method of allocating board members that is consistent with law, the allocation of the board members shall be as provided in this subsection. The school district with the largest number of pupils attending the joint, contract, or consolidated school shall have three members on the joint board. Each other school district shall have at least one member on the joint board, and its total membership shall be determined by dividing the number of pupils from the school district with the largest enrollment by three, rounding off the quotient to the nearest whole number, which shall be called the "factor" and by then dividing the pupil enrollment of each of the other school districts by the "factor," rounding off this quotient to the nearest whole number, this number being the number of school directors on the joint board from each of the other school districts. Pupil enrollment for the purpose of determining the number of members on the joint board to which each school district is entitled shall be taken from the school registers on January 1 of the calendar year in which the school year starts. The joint board shall annually select from among its members a chair and a clerk and shall also select a treasurer from among the treasurers of the contracting districts.

        School district budget could be established by Australian ballot only as proposed by its school board upon affirmative vote at the annual or subsequent meeting; therefore, petition signed by approximately ten percent of district's voters requesting that an article be included in the warning proposing a lower budget than that proposed by the board was for an unlawful purpose and correctly excluded from the warning.

        Town voters were not entitled to a new reconsideration vote on school budget under this section because 17 V.S.A.
        §
        2661(c) prohibits reconsideration of questions voted on at a previous meeting without the approval of the legislative body of the district and there had already been one reconsideration vote on the same budget; the term "question voted on" means the budget of the school district and not the specific budget amount submitted to the voters.

       When a majority of the voters of the town or city present and voting at a meeting duly warned for that purpose votes to withdraw from a unified union school district, the vote shall be certified by the clerk of the town or city to the Secretary of State who shall record the certificate in his or her office and give notice of the vote to the other towns or cities corresponding to the preexisting school districts that voted to form the unified union school district. Such other towns and cities shall vote by Australian ballot on the same day during the same hours whether to ratify the withdrawal of the town or city.

In addition, the State Board shall declare the preexisting school district corresponding to the withdrawing town or city to be reconstituted. The State Board shall give notice to the remaining towns and cities in the unified union school district of its meeting and give the relevant representatives an opportunity to be heard. It shall then determine whether it is in the best interests of the State, the students, and the school districts remaining in the unified union school district that the unified union district continue to exist. The State Board may declare the unified union school district dissolved as of July 1 immediately following or as soon thereafter as each remaining town's or city's obligations have been satisfied, or it may declare that the unified union district shall continue to exist despite the withdrawal of the former town or city member. The State Board shall file its declaration with the Secretary of State, the clerk of the withdrawing town or city, and the clerk of the affected unified union school district.

    The term of each member of a planning committee who is not also a school board member shall expire on June thirtieth of the third year following his or her appointment.
    The existence of any planning committee may be terminated either by vote of a majority of its members or by joint action of the commissioners.
    In forming and appointing members to an interstate school district planning board, the commissioners shall consider and take into account recommendations and nominations made by school boards of member districts.
    No member of a planning committee shall be disqualified because he or she is at the same time a member of another planning board or committee created under the provisions of this compact or under any other provisions of law.
    Any existing informal interstate school planning committee may be reconstituted as a formal planning committee in accordance with the provisions hereof, and its previous deliberations adopted and ratified by the reorganized formal planning committee.
    Vacancies on a planning committee shall be filled by the commissioners acting jointly.

Subsequent meetings may be called by either officer of the committee.
    The members of the committee shall serve without pay.
    The member districts shall appropriate money on an equal basis at each annual meeting to meet the expenses of the committee, including the cost of publication and distribution of reports and advertising.
    From time to time the commissioners may add additional members and additional member districts to the committee, and may remove members and member districts from the committee.

       Hearings.
      </b>
      If the planning committee recommends the formation of an interstate school district, it shall hold at least one public hearing on its report and the proposed articles of agreement within the proposed interstate school district in New Hampshire, and at least one public hearing thereon within the proposed interstate school district in Vermont.
    The planning committee shall give such notice thereof as it may determine to be reasonable, provided that such notice shall include at least one publication in a newspaper of general circulation within the proposed interstate school district not less than 15 days (not counting the date of publication and not counting the date of the hearing) before the date of the first hearing.
    Such hearings may be adjourned from time to time and from place to place.
    The planning committee may revise the proposed articles of agreement after the date of the hearings.
    It shall not be required to hold further hearings on the revised articles of agreement but may hold one or more further hearings after notice similar to that required for the first hearings if the planning committee in its sole discretion determines that the revisions are so substantial in nature as to require further presentation to the public before submission to the state boards of education.
     </p>
     <p>
      F.
      <b>
       Approval by State Boards.
      </b>
      After the hearings a copy of the proposed articles of agreement, as revised, signed by a majority of the planning committee, shall be submitted by it to each state board.
    The state boards may (a) if they find that the articles of agreement are in accord with the standards set forth in this compact and in accordance with sound educational policy, approve the same as submitted, or (b) refer them back to the planning committee for further study.
    The planning committee may make additional revisions to the proposed articles of agreement to conform to the recommendations of the state boards.
    Further hearings on the proposed articles of agreement shall not be required unless ordered by the state boards in their discretion.
    In exercising such discretion, the state boards shall take into account whether or not the additional revisions are so substantial in nature as to require further presentation to the public.
    If both state boards find that the articles of agreement as further revised are in accord with the standards set forth in this compact and in accordance with sound educational policy, they shall approve the same.
    After approval by both state boards, each state board shall cause the articles of agreement to be submitted to the school boards of the several member districts in each state for acceptance by the member districts as provided in the following paragraph.
    At the same time, each state board shall designate the form of warrant, date, time, place, and period of voting for the special meeting of the member district to be held in accordance with the following paragraph.
     </p>
     <p>
      G.
      <b>
       Adoption by Member Districts.
      </b>
      Upon receipt of written notice from the state board in its state of the approval of the articles of agreement by both state boards, the school board of each member district shall cause the articles of agreement to be filed with the member district clerk.
    Within ten days after receipt of such notice, the school board shall issue its warrant for a special meeting of the member district, the warrant to be in the form, and the meeting to be held at the time and place and in the manner prescribed by the state board.
    No approval of the superior court shall be required for such special school district meeting in New Hampshire.
    Voting shall be with the use of the check list by a ballot substantially in the following form:
      <br/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "Shall the school district accept the provisions of the New Hampshire-Vermont Interstate School Compact providing for the establishment of an interstate school district, together with the school districts of

      A.
      <b>
       Interstate District Indebtedness.
      </b>
      Indebtedness of an interstate district shall be a general obligation of the district and shall also be a joint and several general obligation of each member district, except that such obligations of the district and its member districts shall not be deemed indebtedness of any member district for the purposes of determining its borrowing capacity under New Hampshire or Vermont law.
    A member district which withdraws from an interstate district shall remain liable for indebtedness of the interstate district which is outstanding at the time of withdrawal and shall be responsible for paying its share of such indebtedness to the same extent as though it had not been withdrawn.
     </p>
     <p>
      B.
      <b>
       Temporary Borrowing.
      </b>
      The interstate board may authorize the borrowing of money by the interstate district (1) in anticipation of payments of operating and capital expenses by the member districts to the interstate districts and (2) in anticipation of the issue of bonds or notes of the interstate district which have been authorized for the purpose of financing capital projects. Such temporary borrowing shall be evidenced by interest bearing or discounted notes of the interstate district.
    The amount of notes issued in any fiscal year in anticipation of expense payments shall not exceed the amount of such payments received by the interstate district in the preceding fiscal year. Notes issued under this paragraph shall be payable within one year in the case of notes under clause (1) and three years in the case of notes under clause (2) from their respective dates, but the principal of and interest on notes issued for a shorter period may be renewed or paid from time to time by the issue of other notes, provided that the period from the date of an original note to the maturity of any note issued to renew or pay the same debt shall not exceed the maximum period permitted for the original loan.
     </p>
     <p>
      C.
      <b>
       Borrowing for Capital Projects.
      </b>
      An interstate district may incur debt and issue its bonds or notes to finance capital projects.
    Such projects may consist of the acquisition or improvement of land and buildings for school purposes, the construction, reconstruction, alteration, or enlargement of school buildings and related school facilities, the acquisition of equipment of a lasting character and the payment of judgments.
    No interstate district may authorize indebtedness in excess of ten percent of the total fair market value of taxable property in its member districts as defined in article VI of this compact. The primary obligation of the interstate district to pay indebtedness of member districts shall not be considered indebtedness of the interstate district for the purpose of determining its borrowing capacity under this paragraph. Bonds or notes issued under this paragraph shall mature in equal or diminishing installments of principal payable at least annually commencing no later than two years and ending not later than thirty years after their dates.
     </p>
     <p>
      D.
      <b>
       Authorization Proceedings.
      </b>
      An interstate district shall authorize the incurring of debts to finance capital projects by a majority vote of the district passed at an annual or special district meeting. Such vote shall be taken by secret ballot after full opportunity for debate, and any such vote shall be subject to reconsideration and further action by the district at the same meeting or at an adjourned session thereof. As an alternative, an interstate district may provide in its articles of agreement that such a vote be conducted by Australian or official balloting under procedures as set forth in the articles of agreement, and that such vote be subject to any method of reconsideration, if any, the interstate district sets forth in the articles of agreement.

      E.
      <b>
       Sale of Bonds and Notes.
      </b>
      Bonds and notes which have been authorized under this article may be issued from time to time and shall be sold at not less than par and accrued interest at public or private sale by the chairman of the school board and by the treasurer.
    Interstate district bonds and notes shall be signed by the said officers, except that either one of the two required signatures may be a facsimile.
    Subject to this compact and the authorizing vote, they shall be in such form, bear such rates of interest and mature at such times as the said officers may determine. Bonds shall, but notes need not, bear the seal of the interstate district, or a facsimile of such seal.
    Any bonds or notes of the interstate district which are properly executed by the said officers shall be valid and binding according to their terms notwithstanding that before the delivery thereof such officers may have ceased to be officers of the interstate district.
     </p>
     <p>
      F.
      <b>
       Proceeds of Bonds.
      </b>
      Any accrued interest received upon delivery of bonds or notes of an interstate district shall be applied to the payment of the first interest which becomes due thereon.
    The other proceeds of the sale of such bonds or notes, other than temporary notes, including any premiums, may be temporarily invested by the interstate district pending their expenditure; and such proceeds, including any income derived from the temporary investment of such proceeds, shall be used to pay the costs of issuing and marketing the bonds or notes and to meet the operating expenses or capital expenses in accordance with the purposes for which the bonds or notes were issued or, by proceedings taken in the manner required for the authorization of such debt, for other purposes for which such debt could be incurred.
    No purchaser of any bonds or notes of an interstate district shall be responsible in any way to see to the application of the proceeds thereof.

      G.
      <b>
       State Aid Programs.
      </b>
      As used in this paragraph the term "initial aid" shall include New Hampshire and Vermont financial assistance with respect to a capital project, or the means of financing a capital project, which is available in connection with construction costs of a capital project or which is available at the time indebtedness is incurred to finance the project. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing definition, initial aid shall specifically include a New Hampshire state guarantee under RSA 195-B with respect to bonds or notes and Vermont construction aid under chapter 123 of this title.
    As used in this paragraph the term "long-term aid" shall include New Hampshire and Vermont financial assistance which is payable periodically in relation to capital costs incurred by an interstate district. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing definition, long-term aid shall specifically include New Hampshire school building aid under RSA 198 and Vermont school building aid under chapter 123 of this title. For the purpose of applying for, receiving and expending initial aid and long-term aid an interstate district shall be deemed a native school district by each state, subject to the following provisions.
    When an interstate district has appropriated money for a capital project, the amount appropriated shall be divided into a New Hampshire share and a Vermont share in accordance with the capital expense apportionment formula in the articles of agreement as though the total amount appropriated for the project was a capital expense requiring apportionment in the year the appropriation is made.
    New Hampshire initial aid shall be available with respect to the amount of the New Hampshire share as though it were authorized indebtedness of a New Hampshire cooperative school district.
    In the case of a state guarantee of interstate district bonds or notes under RSA 195-B, the interstate district shall be eligible to apply for and receive an unconditional state guarantee with respect to an amount of its bonds or notes which does not exceed 50 percent of the amount of the New Hampshire share as determined above. Vermont initial aid shall be available with respect to the amount of the Vermont share as though it were funds voted by a Vermont school district.
    Payments of Vermont initial aid shall be made to the interstate district, and the amount of any borrowing authorized to meet the appropriation for the capital project shall be reduced accordingly.
    New Hampshire and Vermont long-term aid shall be payable to the interstate district.
    The amounts of long-term aid in each year shall be based on the New Hampshire and Vermont shares of the amount of indebtedness of the interstate district which is payable in that year and which has been apportioned in accordance with the capital expense apportionment formula in the articles of agreement.
    The New Hampshire aid shall be payable at the rate of forty-five percent, if there are three or less New Hampshire members in the interstate district, and otherwise it shall be payable as though the New Hampshire members were a New Hampshire cooperative school district.
    New Hampshire and Vermont long-term aid shall be deducted from the total capital expenses for the fiscal year in which the long-term aid is payable, and the balance of such expenses shall be apportioned among the member districts.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, New Hampshire and Vermont may at any time change their state school aid programs that are in existence when this compact takes effect and may establish new programs, and any legislation for these purposes may specify how such programs shall be applied with respect to interstate districts.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, the respective amounts of New Hampshire and Vermont initial and long-term aid, with respect to a capital project of the Dresden School District for which indebtedness is authorized by a vote of the District after July 1, 1977, shall be initially determined for each year for each member district by the manner provided in this paragraph and the aid shall be paid to the Dresden School District, however, the amount of aid for those capital projects received by the Dresden School District on account of each member district shall be used by the district to reduce the sums which would otherwise be required to be raised by taxation within that member district.
     </p>

      <b>
       Tax Exemption.
      </b>
      Bonds and notes of an interstate school district shall be exempt from local property taxes in both states, and the interest or discount thereon and any profit derived from the disposition thereof shall be exempt from personal income taxes in both states.
     </p>
     <p>
      I.
    Notwithstanding paragraph G of this Article, initial and longterm aid may be allocated among the members of an interstate district other than the Dresden School District in the manner which is provided in the articles of agreement of that district, or if not therein provided, in the manner specified in paragraph G for all interstate districts other than the Dresden School District.

      3.
    It shall be the duty of the superintendent in an interstate district to: (a) advise teachers and other professional staff employees contracted for the district about the terms of the contract and the policies and procedures of the retirement system; (b) see that each teacher or professional staff employee selects the retirement system of his choice at the time his contract is signed; (c) provide the commissioners of education in New Hampshire and in Vermont with the names and other pertinent information regarding each staff member under his jurisdiction so that each may be enrolled in the retirement system of his preference.

    Such hearings may be adjourned from time to time and from place to place.
    The planning committee may revise the proposed articles of agreement
    after the date of the hearings.
    It shall not be required to hold further hearings on the revised articles of agreement but may hold one or more further hearings after notice similar to that required for the first hearings if the planning committee in its sole discretion determines that the revisions are so substantial in nature as to require further presentation to the public before submission to the state boards of education.

     <p>
      <b>
       F. Approval by state boards.

    The state boards may (a) if they find that the articles of agreement are in accord with the standards set forth in this compact and in accordance with sound educational policy, approve the same as submitted, or (b) refer them back to the planning committee for further study.
    The planning committee may make additional revisions to the proposed articles of agreement to conform to the recommendations of the state boards.
    Further hearings on the proposed articles of agreement shall not be required unless ordered by the state boards in their discretion.
    In exercising such discretion, the state boards shall take into account whether or not the additional revisions are so substantial in nature as to require further presentation to the public.
    If both state boards find that the articles of agreement as further revised are in accord with the standards set forth in this compact and in accordance with sound educational policy, they shall approve the same.
    After approval by both state boards, each state board shall cause the articles of agreement to be submitted to the school boards of the several member districts in each state for acceptance by the member districts as provided in the following paragraph.
    At the same time, each state board shall designate the form of warrant, date, time, place, and period of voting for the special meeting of the member district to be held in accordance with the following paragraph.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>

      </b>
      Upon receipt of written notice from the state board in its state of the approval of the articles of agreement by both state boards, the school board of each member district shall cause the articles of agreement to be filed with the member district clerk.
    Within ten days after receipt of such notice, the school board shall issue its warrant for a special meeting of the member district, the warrant to be in the form, and the meeting to be held at the time and place and in the manner prescribed by the state board.
    No approval of the superior court shall be required for such special school district meeting in New York.
    Voting shall be with the use of the check list by a ballot substantially in the following form:
      <br/>
     </p>
     <p>
      <br/>
      <br/>
      "Shall the school district accept the provisions of the New York-Vermont Interstate School Compact providing for the establishment of an interstate school district, together with the school districts of
    .................... and
    ...................., etc., in accordance with the provisions of the proposed articles of agreement filed with the school district (town, city or incorporated school district) clerk?"
      <br/>
      Yes (
    )
    No (
    )
     </p>
     <p>
      If the articles of agreement included the nomination of individual school directors, those nominated from each member district shall be included in the ballot and voted upon, such election to become effective upon the formation of an interstate school district.
     </p>
     <p>
      If a majority of the voters present and voting in a member district vote in the affirmative, the clerk for such member district shall forthwith send to the state board in its state a certified copy of the warrant, certificate of posting, and minutes of the meeting of the district.
    If the state boards of both states find that a majority of the voters present and voting in each member district have voted in favor of the establishment of the interstate school district, they shall issue a joint certificate to that effect; and such certificate shall be conclusive evidence of the lawful organization and formation of the interstate school district as of its date of issuance.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       H. Resubmission.
      </b>
      If the proposed articles of agreement are adopted by one or more of the member districts but rejected by one or more of the member districts,
    the state boards may resubmit them, in the same form as previously submitted, to the rejecting member districts, in which case the school boards thereof shall resubmit them to the voters in accordance with paragraph G of this article.
    An affirmative vote in accordance therewith shall have the same effect as though the articles of agreement had been adopted in the first instance.
    In the alternative, the state boards may either (a) discharge the planning committee, or (b) refer the articles of agreement back for further consideration to the same or a reconstituted planning committee, which shall have all of the powers and duties as the planning committee as originally constituted.

      <b>
       A. Budget.

       C. Apportionment of appropriation.
      </b>
      Subject to the provisions of article VII hereof, the interstate board shall first apply against such appropriation any income to which the interstate district is entitled, and shall then apportion the balance among the member districts in accordance with one of the following formulas as determined by the articles of agreement as amended from time to time:
     </p>
     <p>
      a. All of such balance to be apportioned on the basis of the ratio that the fair market value of the taxable property in each member district bears to that of the entire interstate district; or
     </p>
     <p>
      b. All of such balance to be apportioned on the basis that the average daily resident membership for the preceding fiscal year of each member district bears to that of the average daily resident membership of the entire interstate school district; or
     </p>
     <p>
      c. A formula based on any combination of the foregoing factors.
     </p>
     <p>

     </p>
     <p>
      Such assessed valuation and grand list may be further adjusted (by elimination of certain types of taxable property from one or the other or otherwise) in accordance with the articles of agreement, in order that the fair market value of taxable property in each state shall be comparable.
     </p>
     <p>
      "Average daily resident membership" of the interstate district in the first instance shall be the sum of the average daily resident membership of the member districts in the grades involved for the preceding fiscal year where no students were enrolled in the interstate district schools for such preceding fiscal year.

       § 797. Borrowing - Article VII.
       <br/>
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      <b>
       A. Interstate district indebtedness.
      </b>
      Indebtedness of an interstate district shall be a general obligation of the district and shall also be a joint and several general obligation of each member district, except that such obligations of the district and its member districts shall not be deemed indebtedness of any member district for the purposes of determining its borrowing capacity under New York and Vermont law.
    A member district which withdraws from an interstate district shall remain liable for indebtedness of the interstate district which is outstanding at the time of withdrawal and shall be responsible for paying its share of such indebtedness to the same extent as though it had not been withdrawn.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       B. Temporary borrowing.
      </b>
      The interstate board may authorize the borrowing of money by the interstate district (1) in anticipation of payments of operating and capital expenses by the member districts to the interstate districts and (2) in anticipation of the issue of bonds or notes of the interstate district which have been authorized for the purpose of financing capital projects. Such temporary borrowing shall be evidenced by interest bearing or discounted notes of the interstate district.
    The amount of notes issued in any fiscal year in anticipation of expense payments shall not exceed the amount of such payments received by the interstate district in the preceding fiscal year. Notes issued under this paragraph shall be payable within one year in the case of notes under clause (1) and three years in the case of notes under clause (2) from their respective dates, but the principal of and interest on notes issued for a shorter period may be renewed or paid from time to time by the issue of other notes, provided that the period from the date of an original note to the maturity of any note issued to renew or pay the same debt shall not exceed the maximum period permitted for the original loan.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       C. Borrowing for capital projects.
      </b>
      An interstate district may incur debt and issue its bonds or notes to finance capital projects.
    Such projects may consist of the acquisition or improvement of land and buildings for school purposes, the construction, reconstruction, alteration, or enlargement of school buildings and related school facilities, the acquisition of equipment of a lasting character and the payment of judgments.
    No interstate district may authorize indebtedness in excess of ten percent of the total fair market value of taxable property in its member districts as defined in article VI of this compact. The primary obligation of the interstate district to pay indebtedness of member districts shall not be considered indebtedness of the interstate district for the purpose of determining its borrowing capacity under this paragraph. Bonds or notes issued under this paragraph shall mature in equal or diminishing installments of principal payable at least annually commencing no later than two years and ending not later than thirty years after their dates.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       D. Authorization proceedings.
      </b>
      An interstate district shall authorize the incurring of debts to finance capital projects by a majority vote of the district passed at an annual or special district meeting.
    Such vote shall be taken by secret ballot after full opportunity for debate, and any such vote shall be subject to reconsideration and further action by the district at the same meeting or at an adjourned session thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       E. Sale of bonds and notes.
      </b>
      Bonds and notes which have been authorized under this article may be issued from time to time and shall be sold at not less than par and accrued interest at public or private sale by the chairman of the school board and by the treasurer.
    Interstate district bonds and notes shall be signed by the said officers, except that either one of the two required signatures may be a facsimile.
    Subject to this compact and the authorizing vote, they shall be in such form, bear such rates of interest and mature at such times as the said officers may determine. Bonds shall, but notes need not, bear the seal of the interstate district or a facsimile of such seal.
    Any bonds or notes of the interstate district which are properly executed by the said officers shall be valid and binding according to their terms notwithstanding that before the delivery thereof such officers may have ceased to be officers of the interstate district.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       F. Proceeds of bonds.
      </b>
      Any accrued interest received upon delivery of bonds or notes of an interstate district shall be applied to the payment of the first interest which becomes due thereon.
    The other proceeds of the sale of such bonds or notes, other than temporary notes, including any premiums, may be temporarily invested by the interstate district pending their expenditure; and such proceeds, including any income derived from the temporary investment of such proceeds, shall be used to pay the costs of issuing and marketing the bonds or notes and to meet the operating expenses or capital expenses in accordance with the purposes for which the bonds or notes were issued or, by proceedings taken in the manner required for the authorization of such debt, for other purposes for which such debt could be incurred.
    No purchaser of any bonds or notes of an interstate district shall be responsible in any way to see to the application of the proceeds thereof.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>
       G. State aid programs.
      </b>
      As used in this paragraph the term "initial aid" shall include New York and Vermont financial assistance with respect to a capital project, or the means of financing a capital project, which is available in connection with construction costs of a capital project or which is available at the time indebtedness is incurred to finance the project.
    Without limiting the generality of the foregoing definition, initial aid shall specifically include a New York state guarantee under Education Law §§ 1709 and 2512 with respect to bonds or notes and Vermont construction aid under 16 V.S.A. chapter 123.
    As used in this paragraph the term "long-term aid" shall include New York and Vermont financial assistance which is payable periodically in relation to capital costs incurred by an interstate district. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing definition, long-term aid shall specifically include New York school building aid under Education Law §§ 416 and 417 and Vermont school building aid under 16 V.S.A. chapter 123.
    For the purpose of applying for, receiving and expending initial aid and long-term aid an interstate district shall be deemed a native school district by each state, subject to the following provisions.
    When an interstate district has appropriated money for a capital project, the amount appropriated shall be divided into a New York share and a Vermont share in accordance with the capital expense apportionment formula in the articles of agreement as though the total amount appropriated for the project was a capital expense requiring apportionment in the year the appropriation is made.
    New York initial aid shall be available with respect to the amount of the New York share as though it were authorized indebtedness of a New York cooperative school district.
    In the case of a state guarantee of interstate districts bonds or notes under Education Law §§ 1709 and 2512, the interstate district shall be eligible to apply for and receive an unconditional state guarantee with respect to an amount of its bonds or notes which does not exceed fifty percent of the amount of the New York share as determined above.
    Vermont initial aid shall be available with respect to the amount of the Vermont share as though it were funds voted by a Vermont school district. Payments of Vermont initial aid shall be made to the interstate district, and the amount of any borrowing authorized to meet the appropriation for the capital project shall be reduced accordingly.
    New York and Vermont long-term aid shall be payable to the interstate district.
    The amounts of long-term aid in each year shall be based on the New York and Vermont shares of the amount of indebtedness of the interstate district which is payable in that year and which has been apportioned in accordance with the capital expense apportionment formula in the articles of agreement.
    The New York aid shall be payable at the rate of forty-five percent, if there are three or less New York members in the interstate district, and otherwise it shall be payable as though the New York members were a New York cooperative school district.
    New York and Vermont long-term aid shall be deducted from the total capital expenses for the fiscal year in which the long-term aid is payable, and the balance of such expenses shall be apportioned among the member districts.
    Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, New York and Vermont may at any time change their state school aid programs that are in existence when this compact takes effect and may establish new programs, and any legislation for these purposes may specify how such programs shall be applied with respect to interstate districts.

      <b>
       H. Tax exemption.

    If the interstate district incorporates only a part of the schools in the member school district, then the school board of the member school district shall continue in existence and it shall have all of the powers and be subject to all of the obligations imposed by law on it and not herein delegated to the district.
    However, if all of the schools in the member school district are incorporated into the interstate school district, then the member or members of the interstate board representing the member district shall have all of the powers and be subject to all of the obligations imposed by law on the members of a school board for the member district and not herein delegated to the interstate district.

      <b>
       E. Employment.
      </b>
      Each employee of an interstate district assigned to a school located in Vermont shall be considered an employee of a Vermont school district for the purpose of the State Teachers' Retirement System of Vermont, the State Employees' Retirement System, the Vermont workers' compensation law, and any other law relating to the regulation of employment or the provision of benefits for employees of Vermont school districts except as follows:
     </p>
     <p>
      1.
    A teacher in a Vermont member district may elect to remain a member of the State Teachers' Retirement System of Vermont, even though assigned to teach in an interstate school in New York.
     </p>
     <p>
      2.
    Employees of interstate districts designated as professional or instructional staff members, as defined in article I hereof, may elect to participate in the teachers' retirement system of either the State of Vermont or the State of New York but in no case will they participate in both retirement systems simultaneously.
     </p>
     <p>
      3.
    It shall be the duty of the superintendent in an interstate district to: (a) advise teachers and other professional staff employees contracted for the district about the terms of the contract and the policies and procedures of the retirement system; (b) see that each teacher or professional staff employee selects the retirement system of his choice at the time his contract is signed; (c) provide the commissioners of education in New York and in Vermont with the names and other pertinent information regarding each staff member under his jurisdiction so that each may be enrolled in the retirement system of his preference.

     <p>
      A.
      <b>
       Rulemaking Authority
     - .
      </b>
      The Interstate Commission shall promulgate reasonable rules in order to effectively and efficiently achieve the purposes of this Compact. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event the Interstate Commission exercises its rulemaking authority in a manner that is beyond the scope of the purposes of this Act, or the powers granted hereunder, then such an action by the Interstate Commission shall be invalid and have no force or effect.
     </p>
     <p>
      B.
      <b>
       Rulemaking Procedure
     - .
      </b>
      Rules shall be made pursuant to a rulemaking process that substantially conforms to the "Model State Administrative Procedure Act," of 1981, Uniform Laws Annotated, Vol. 15, p.1 (2000) as amended, as may be appropriate to the operations of the Interstate Commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      C.
    Not later than thirty (30) days after a rule is promulgated, any person may file a petition for judicial review of the rule; provided, that the filing of such a petition shall not stay or otherwise prevent the rule from becoming effective unless the court finds that the petitioner has a substantial likelihood of success. The court shall give deference to the actions of the Interstate Commission consistent with applicable law and shall not find the rule to be unlawful if the rule represents a reasonable exercise of the Interstate Commission's authority.
     </p>
     <p>
      D.
    If a majority of the legislatures of the compacting states rejects a rule by enactment of a statute or resolution in the same manner used to adopt the compact, then such rule shall have no further force and effect in any compacting state.

       Oversight.
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      1. Each member state shall enforce this compact to effectuate the compact's purposes and intent. The rules promulgated under this act shall have standing as a rule promulgated under the Vermont Administrative Procedure Act as found in 3 V.S.A. chapter 25.
     </p>
     <p>
      2. All courts shall take judicial notice of the compact and the rules in any judicial or administrative proceeding in a member state pertaining to the subject matter of this compact which may affect the powers, responsibilities, or actions of the Interstate Commission.
     </p>
     <p>
      3. The Interstate Commission shall be entitled to receive all service of process in any such proceeding, and shall have standing to intervene in the proceeding for all purposes. Failure to provide service of process to the Interstate Commission shall render a judgment or order void as to the Interstate Commission, this compact, or promulgated rules.

      B.
      <b>
       Default, Technical Assistance, Suspension, and Termination
     - .
      </b>
      If the Interstate Commission determines that a member state has defaulted in the performance of its obligations or responsibilities under this compact, or the bylaws or promulgated rules, the Interstate Commission shall:
     </p>
     <p>
      1. Provide written notice to the defaulting state and other member states of the nature of the default, the means of curing the default, and any action taken by the Interstate Commission. The Interstate Commission shall specify the conditions by which the defaulting state must cure its default.
     </p>
     <p>
      2. Provide remedial training and specific technical assistance regarding the default.
     </p>
     <p>
      3. If the defaulting state fails to cure the default, the defaulting state shall be terminated from the compact upon an affirmative vote of a majority of the member states and all rights, privileges, and benefits conferred by this compact shall be terminated from the effective date of termination. A cure of the default does not relieve the offending state of obligations or liabilities incurred during the period of the default.
     </p>
     <p>
      4. Suspension or termination of membership in the compact shall be imposed only after all other means of securing compliance have been exhausted. Notice of intent to suspend or terminate shall be given by the Interstate Commission to the Governor, the majority and minority leaders of the defaulting state's legislature, and each of the member states.
     </p>
     <p>
      5. The state which has been suspended or terminated is responsible for all assessments, obligations, and liabilities incurred through the effective date of suspension or termination, not to exceed $100 per year as provided in Article XIV, Section E, of this compact for each year that the State of Vermont is a member of the compact.
     </p>
     <p>
      6. The Interstate Commission shall not bear any costs relating to any state that has been found to be in default or which has been suspended or terminated from the compact, unless otherwise mutually agreed upon in writing between the Interstate Commission and the defaulting state.
     </p>
     <p>
      7. The defaulting state may appeal the action of the Interstate Commission by petitioning the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia or the federal district where the Interstate Commission has its principal offices. The prevailing party shall be awarded all costs of such litigation including reasonable attorney's fees.
     </p>

      C.
      <b>
       Dispute Resolution.
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      1. The Interstate Commission shall attempt, upon the request of a member state, to resolve disputes which are subject to the compact and which may arise among member states and between member and non-member states.
     </p>
     <p>
      2. The Interstate Commission shall promulgate a rule providing for both mediation and binding dispute resolution for disputes as appropriate.

      B.
    The Interstate Commission may levy on and collect an annual assessment from each member state to cover the cost of the operations and activities of the Interstate Commission and its staff which must be in a total amount sufficient to cover the Interstate Commission's annual budget as approved each year. The aggregate annual assessment amount shall be allocated based upon a formula to be determined by the Interstate Commission, which shall promulgate a rule binding upon all member states.
     </p>
     <p>
      C.
    The Interstate Commission shall not incur obligations of any kind prior to securing the funds adequate to meet the same; nor shall the Interstate Commission pledge the credit of any of the member states, except by and with the authority of the member state.
     </p>
     <p>
      D.
    The Interstate Commission shall keep accurate accounts of all receipts and disbursements. The receipts and disbursements of the Interstate Commission shall be subject to the audit and accounting procedures established under its bylaws. However, all receipts and disbursements of funds handled by the Interstate Commission shall be audited yearly by a certified or licensed public accountant, and the report of the audit shall be included in and become part of the annual report of the Interstate Commission.

       </p>
       <p>
        "(a) The General Assembly finds that kindergarten is an important part of a child's education, and that children who have had kindergarten experiences generally are at an educational advantage during their later schooling.
    Most learning materials and curricula for schools presuppose that children have had kindergarten schooling.
       </p>
       <p>
        "(b) It is the intention of the General Assembly to require that by July 1, 1988 all Vermont children of suitable age and development will have access to a publicly supported kindergarten.
    It is the preference of the general assembly that such programs, whenever possible, shall be provided in publicly operated elementary schools.
    However, the General Assembly recognizes that due to the rural nature of the state, in some cases direct operation of a kindergarten is not practicable.
    In those cases the General Assembly recognizes that it may be necessary to permit tuition payments to state approved private kindergartens."

         School district's tuition-payment policy violated Compelled Support Clause of Vermont Constitution by authorizing tuition reimbursement to sectarian schools, where neither tuition payment statutes nor Board of Education rules imposed any restrictions that prevented use of public money to fund religious education. Chittenden Town School District v. Department of Education, 169 Vt. 310, 738 A.2d 539 (1999).
        </p>
        <p>
         Providing educational opportunity for school-age children while offering educational choice between public and private schools is valid secular purpose for tuition reimbursement scheme. Campbell v. Manchester Bd. of Sch. Dirs., 161 Vt. 441, 641 A.2d 352 (1994).
        </p>
        <p>
         Tuition reimbursement scheme does not foster excessive government entanglement with religion, where aid flowing to religious school is result of parental choice in selecting the school, and where the school is already approved to select students for reimbursement, thereby involving no greater government regulation or involvement. Campbell v. Manchester Bd. of Sch. Dirs., 161 Vt. 441, 641 A.2d 352 (1994).
        </p>
        <p>
         Primary effect of tuition reimbursement scheme to private school does not advance religion where: scheme covers all students whether or not they attend public or private school; there is no indication that aid to sectarian education is either purpose or main effect of scheme; and any aid flowing to religious schools resulting from reimbursement scheme derives from parent's choice rather than government involvement. Campbell v. Manchester Bd. of Sch. Dirs., 161 Vt. 441, 641 A.2d 352 (1994).

        <p>
         Where section 1075 of this title provided that residence of a pupil in the care and custody of the Department of Social and Rehabilitation Services was where the pupil was placed and this section required each school district to pay the tuition of its residents, district which had pupils in State's custody placed in a group home in the district was liable for their tuition when they were sent to a neighboring district's high school because district with the group home had no high school. Stoneman v. Vergennes Union High School District # 5, 139 Vt. 50, 421 A.2d 1307 (1980), overruled on other grounds, Cronin v. State (1987) 148 Vt. 252, 531 A.2d 929, reinstated, Libercent v.

        <p>
         That, under this section, each school district had to pay the tuition of its residents and residency of a pupil in State's care and custody was where the pupil was placed, did not violate State Constitution's Proportional Contribution Clause on the theory that it cast a heavier burden on districts with group homes in which pupils under State's custody were placed, while the public in general was benefited, for the burden on the districts with group homes was reasonably related to the purpose of treating the pupils as normal residents of the community. Stoneman v. Vergennes Union High School District # 5, 139 Vt. 50, 421 A.2d 1307 (1980), overruled on other grounds, Cronin v. State (1987) 148 Vt. 252, 531 A.2d 929, reinstated, Libercent v.

      <p>
       A school district shall not pay the tuition of a student except to a public school, an approved independent school, an independent school meeting education quality standards, a tutorial program approved by the State Board, an approved education program, or an independent school in another state or country approved under the laws of that state or country, nor shall payment of tuition on behalf of a person be denied on account of age. Unless otherwise provided, a person who is aggrieved by a decision of a school board relating to eligibility for tuition payments, the amount of tuition payable, or the school he or she may attend, may appeal to the State Board and its decision shall be final.

        </h5>
        <p>
         Decision of Board of Education involving constitutional and legal precepts was of judicial rather than administrative nature and proper route for relief by aggrieved party was to file petition for certiorari. Campbell v. Manchester Board of School Directors, 152 Vt. 643, 565 A.2d 1318 (mem.) (1989).
        </p>
        <p>
         Superior Court had jurisdiction to review decision of Vermont Board of Education denying tuition reimbursement for student attending private high school, where although statute provides that decisions of State Board are final, jurisdictional issue was not raised, and no alternative routes by which plaintiff could pursue constitutional issues were suggested. Campbell v. Manchester Bd. of Sch. Dirs., 161 Vt. 441, 641 A.2d 352 (1994).

         In Vermont, the standard of care that schools and their officials must exercise in supervising students is governed by statute. Edson v. Barre Supervisory Union #61, 182 Vt. 157, 933 A.2d 200 (July 20, 2007).
        </p>
        <p>
         Neither the common law, nor this section, holds individuals liable in negligence for consequences that a reasonably prudent person could not have foreseen or anticipated under the circumstances. Edson v. Barre Supervisory Union #61, 182 Vt. 157, 933 A.2d 200 (July 20, 2007).
        </p>
        <p>
         The duty of supervision to students is limited both by statute and by the common law, which requires schools to protect students only from foreseeable risks, and only to the extent necessary to carry out their educational purpose. Nonetheless, where school administrators or teachers fail to exercise ordinary care in supervising students, they may be held liable to the extent their acts or omissions are the proximate cause of a student's injury. Edson v. Barre Supervisory Union #61, 182 Vt. 157, 933 A.2d 200 (July 20, 2007).

         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         High school did not breach the duty of ordinary care and thus could not be held liable under either common law negligence or the statute prescribing the duty of care for public schools because the school was not required to protect a student against an unforeseeable assault by his teammates. The school did not have any knowledge or notice to make the assault foreseeable and, in turn, did not owe the student a duty to protect him from it. Stopford v. Milton Town Sch. Dist., 206 Vt. 462, 202 A.3d 973 (Nov. 16, 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
         Foreseeability of potential risk of harm to a student who left campus unauthorized was not enough to trigger a legal duty on the part of defendant school to protect her where her death was a result of the premeditated criminal act of a third party. Although it has been held that a defendant may be responsible for protecting against the criminal act of another, it has been done only where the defendant had special knowledge or notice upon which to impose a duty to anticipate the wrongful act. Edson v. Barre Supervisory Union #61, 182 Vt. 157, 933 A.2d 200 (July 20, 2007).

         </b>
        </h5>
        <p>
         Enactment of the statute prescribing the duty of care owed by public schools evidences the Legislature's intent: Vermont schools do not owe their students anything other than a duty of ordinary care. In addition, by explicitly stating in the statute that Vermont schools do not owe students a duty of immediate supervision at all times and under all circumstances, the Legislature chose not to impose a heightened duty of care upon Vermont schools. Stopford v. Milton Town Sch. Dist., 206 Vt. 462, 202 A.3d 973 (Nov. 16, 2018).
        </p>
        <p>
         Although school officials are required to take into consideration a student's age, situation, and disposition in exercising reasonable care, these factors do not raise the duty owed under the statute beyond one of ordinary care. Rather, school officials must simply act as the reasonably prudent person would in supervising students of similar age and maturity. Edson v. Barre Supervisory Union #61, 182 Vt. 157, 933 A.2d 200 (July 20, 2007).

        Court agreed with appellants' contention that they would likely succeed in showing that, as applied, the Dual Enrollment Program's "publicly funded" requirement violated their First Amendment right to freely exercise their religion, and that the equities favored preliminary injunctive relief. The district court abused its discretion by denying their motion for a preliminary injunction. A.H. v. French, - F.3d - (2d Cir. Jan. 15, 2021).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Because 16 V.S.A.
        §§
        821-835 mandate local school boards to provide public schools for their own residents, Legislature intended to give school boards broad discretion in controlling influx of voluntary nonresident pupils via 16 V.S.A.

       </p>
       <p>
        School districts have power to demand payment of nonresident pupil tuition directly from parents because, although 16 V.S.A.
        §
        1093 does not explicitly authorize school districts to demand payment from parents, it implicitly gives school districts the discretion to do so. Dover Town School District v. Simon, 162 Vt. 630, 650 A.2d 514 (mem.) (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is within sound discretion of school directors to refuse to accept into school under their control nonresident pupils and to dismiss any nonresident pupils attending such school. 1942-44 Op. Atty. Gen. 117, 1956-58 Op. Atty. Gen. 97.

        School directors of town, in which paupers of school age from another town were kept, could receive them into schools under such terms and restrictions as they deemed best, and school directors of town liable for support of such paupers could provide for their instruction in public schools of town in which they were kept and pay for such instruction.

        From context of this section and section 1094 of this title, it would seem that legislative intent was that tuition should be received by town furnishing schooling to nonresident pupil. 1942-44 Op. Atty. Gen. 117.
       </p>
       <p>
        Permitting a child to attend school without paying tuition, even though he is resident of another town, is not in any way penal offense, but it is better practice for school board to require tuition of all pupils who are not residents of town wherein they are attending school. 1942-44 Op.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        For purposes of challenge under Free Exercise Clause to statutory private school reporting requirements, the State has a compelling interest in regulating attendance and minimum course of study of students in private as well as public schools in order that all students obtain basic skills necessary to function as adults and citizens. State v. DeLaBruere, 154 Vt. 237, 577 A.2d 254 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section's requirement that parents or guardians send children between the ages of seven and sixteen to an approved or reporting private school burdened the free exercise of religion of defendant operating private religious school, even though reporting requirement did not amount to state control of course content, where defendant found the symbols of state regulation as religiously important as actuality of state control. State v. DeLaBruere, 154 Vt. 237, 577 A.2d 254 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        State could validly prosecute parents for truancy of child enrolled in religious school which did not meet private school reporting requirements; in their First Amendment challenge to the reporting statute, parents had emphasized the unity of interest of the church and the parents, and nothing in the record suggested church could not change its policies to comply with the statute or that parents could not control church policy, and parents made no attempt to reconcile the conflict between State requirements and church policy. State v. DeLaBruere, 154 Vt. 237, 577 A.2d 254 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where parents were charged with violation on only two days of truancy statute which proscribed failure to send the child to school "for the full number of days for which a school is held," double jeopardy claim was premature, but could be raised if parents were again prosecuted for failure to send their child to school in the same school year. State v. DeLaBruere, 154 Vt. 237, 577 A.2d 254 (1990).

       <p>
        Information charging parents with violation of truancy statute was not defective for failure to allege all essential elements of the crime; affidavit accompanying the information negated all statutory exceptions to the offense of truancy and parents had sufficient notice of the charges to form a defense.

        This section's requirement that parents cause a child to attend school for "the full number of days for which the school is held," subject to enumerated exceptions, authorizes prosecution for truancy upon the failure to cause a child to attend school, even for one school day.

        Words, "continuously for the full number of days for which such school is held," in this section were used by Legislature and intended for purpose of establishing compulsory attendance period in general sense, and had no reference to tardiness or even temporary absence not inconsistent with general design of requiring compulsory attendance of all pupils of school age, but left tardiness or temporary absences to be regulated and dealt with by constituted school authorities.

        Mere fact that certain officials can excuse pupil from school does not mean that such pupil can be marked "present" during such excused absence, and absence of lawful pupil from school, even though such absence be excused by proper authority, should be included in calculation used to establish average daily attendance of that school for purposes of determining State aid on equated pupil basis. 1940-42 Op.

       <p>
        Subsec. (b) of this section, which penalizes parent or guardian who "without legal excuse" fails to cause a child to attend school as required, was not unconstitutionally vague; Legislature clearly intended list of legal excuse in section 1121 of this title to apply to this section. State v. DeLaBruere, 154 Vt. 237, 577 A.2d 254 (1990).

        Notice required by this section is condition precedent to prosecution. State v. Burroughs, 102 Vt. 33, 145 A. 260 (1929).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where evidence showed that there had been no representation to superintendent of schools where child should attend school as to child's physical or mental inability to attend school on date he was alleged to have been absent, superintendent was not required under section 1124 of this title to investigate concerning child's condition before prosecution was instituted. State v. Maguire, 100 Vt. 476, 138 A. 741 (1927).

       <p>
        Information that alleged truancy occurred on only two days was sufficient to charge a violation of this section. State v. DeLaBruere, 154 Vt. 237, 577 A.2d 254 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Information charging parents with violation of this section was not defective for failure to allege all essential elements of the crime; affidavit accompanying the information negated all statutory exceptions to the offense of truancy and parents had sufficient notice of the charges to form a defense. State v. DeLaBruere, 154 Vt. 237, 577 A.2d 254 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Complaint drawn in accordance with statute sufficiently appraises respondent of "cause and nature of his accusation." State v. McCaferey, 69 Vt. 85, 37 A. 234 (1896).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutory exceptions "unless the child is mentally or physically unable to attend, has already acquired the branches required by law to be taught in the public schools, or is otherwise being furnished with the same education," were not descriptive of offense and so to be negatived by State, but matters of excuse to be shown by respondent. State v. McCaferey, 69 Vt. 85, 37 A. 234 (1896).

        Where truant officer gave parents notice, required by this section, stating that their school age children were not attending an "approved" school, such notice, as the only precedent notice, defined the grounds upon which truancy could be charged against the parents in criminal prosecution.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Truancy prosecution against parents, charging them for failure to cause their children of school age to attend school as required by section 1121 of this title, must be considered in the light of the fact that the charge was a criminal one, potentially subjecting defendants to criminal penalties; therefore, prosecutor had the burden of establishing by the requisite measure all the essential elements of the criminal act. State v. LaBarge, 134 Vt. 276, 357 A.2d 121 (1976).

       <p>
        Where complaint charged that respondent, having control of child of school age, on certain date neglected to send child to school, admission of evidence that child was either tardy or absent on certain other days was erroneous as being evidence of offenses independent and distinct from that charged. State v. Burroughs, 102 Vt. 33, 145 A. 260 (1929).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence that on last day on which child was in school, in being punished by teacher he was exposed to drafts from which he could catch cold or get a chill, offered to explain sudden appearance of his disease on that day, and as bearing upon his condition when he reached home and was kept there by his mother, was properly excluded as not relating to day in issue, with no offer to connect it therewith, and as speculative in character. State v. Maguire, 100 Vt. 476, 138 A. 741 (1927).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where State in respondent's cross-examination had asked several questions evidently designed to show that reason for keeping child out of school was because respondent's wife had not been employed as teacher therein, which respondent denied, testimony of wife that she had applied for position as teacher, but withdrew application when she learned another teacher had been engaged, was properly excluded, since it added nothing to testimony previously introduced. State v. Maguire, 100 Vt. 476, 138 A. 741 (1927).

        Where evidence in prosecution for failure of person having control of child of school age to send child to school as required by law, was close issue of child's physical fitness to attend school at time he was alleged to have been absent, respondent's petition for new trial, based on failure of court to adjourn to permit attendance of witness on this issue, whose evidence was not merely cumulative but of such nature as to render probable different result on another trial, was entitled to favorable consideration, facts showing no lack of diligence by respondent.

In no event shall the waiver extend for a period to exceed a school year."

     §
    
    1, provided:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(a) The General Assembly finds that:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(1) There is significant evidence that hazardous chemical exposure and poor indoor air quality can negatively affect human health and productivity.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) Problems related to hazardous chemical exposure ranging from complaints of minor illness to death are documented in medical, institutional and governmental studies.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(3) Children are particularly susceptible to adverse health effects from hazardous chemical exposure and poor indoor air quality, as their bodies are undergoing rapid growth and development, their immune systems are not fully functional and they are likely to be in contact with materials not encountered by adults.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(4) A school environment, in which hazardous exposures are reduced and an adequate supply of fresh or filtered air is provided reduces viruses and allergens, increases the likelihood that school students and staff will be more alert and productive and may reduce risk of litigation.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(5) Problems involving potentially hazardous chemical exposure and poor indoor air quality are associated with increased use of manufactured construction materials, energy conservation measures which have sealed school buildings more tightly, inadequate air exchange which fails to eliminate pollutants from inside school buildings, and moisture problems that cause biological growth inside school buildings.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(6) Information on least-toxic and nontoxic materials, nonchemical pest control methods and appropriate maintenance practices and standards is widely available through governmental agencies, nonprofit organizations and professional societies, but is not readily accessible through a single information source.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(b) It is the purpose of this act to direct the department of health, in consultation with other state agencies, to compile and make available to all Vermont schools, information about materials and practices commonly used in school operation and construction that may compromise indoor air quality or negatively impact human health. It is also the purpose of this act to encourage schools, with assistance from the department of health, to develop programs that will enable them to identify and eliminate potentially hazardous materials, isolate those hazardous materials that cannot be eliminated, and adequately ventilate school buildings to exhaust any pollutants and contaminants.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(c) It is the goal of this act that at least 50 percent of Vermont schools qualify for an environmental health certification by January 2005."

       The State Board has overall responsibility for the effectiveness of career technical education. This requires the Board to collect suitable information and to take appropriate steps within its legal, financial, and personnel resources to ensure that:
       <ol>
        <li id="t16p02c37sub02s1531ol1a1">
         Career technical education is equally available to students and is of consistent quality in all parts of the State, including areas remote from career technical centers.

         Career technical education is available to adult students, particularly in areas where unemployment is high or occupational retraining needs are great. This includes entering into contracts with postsecondary educational institutions or with any resource supplier to provide adult programs at career technical centers.

        <li id="t16p02c37sub02s1531ol1a4">

         Career technical education programs are well coordinated with related State programs in education and training. This includes ensuring that career technical education graduates receive appropriate credit toward requirements in apprenticeship programs and professional licensing programs.

      <li id="t16p02c37sub02s1531ol1b">
       In order to provide regional career technical education services efficiently, the State Board shall designate a service region for each career technical center. However, the Board may designate a service region for two or more comprehensive high schools if that region is not served by a career technical center.

      <li id="t16p02c37sub02s1531ol1c">
       For a school district that is geographically isolated from a Vermont career technical center, the State Board may approve a career technical center in another state as the career technical center that district students may attend. In this case, the school district shall receive transportation assistance pursuant to section 1563 of this title and tuition assistance pursuant to section 1561(c) of this title. Any student who is a resident in the Windham Southwest Supervisory Union and who is enrolled at public expense in the Charles H.

        "Action" under the statute governing the suspension and dismissal of teachers encompasses both judicial proceedings and proceedings under collective bargaining agreements (CBAs), including grievance-and-arbitration proceedings. Compliance with the pre-termination appeal procedures is a condition that must be met in order to be eligible to bring any post-termination review action, whether that review is by judicial action or by action utilizing a CBA's grievance process.

        Teacher did not receive all pretermination process she was due by virtue of fact that, in meeting on June 12, superintendent informed her that school had not yet decided whether to renew her contract for the following school year.

       <p>
        Just cause, required by subsec.

        Trial court's finding that teacher's employment contract was not specifically limited to a particular assignment or a certain duration did not preclude there being just cause to support nonrenewal of the contract.

       </p>
       <p>
        Where teacher accepted teaching assignment knowing that it was probably only for one year because the regular teacher would be able to return to that position after a leave of absence and the position for which he had originally been hired had been eliminated, there was just cause for nonrenewal of the teacher's employment contract.

       <p>
        This section, relating to procedures and conditions of teacher employment, setting forth procedural rights of a teacher whose contract is not renewed, and providing that "every teacher's contract shall be deemed to contain the provisions of this statute," gives teachers a contractual and statutory right to renewal except for the "just and sufficient cause," that the section states must exist before there can be a nonrenewal. Burroughs v. West Windsor Board of School Directors, 138 Vt. 575, 420 A.2d 861 (1980).

       <p>
        This section, giving teachers a contractual and statutory right to renewal of teachers contract except for just and sufficient cause, giving teachers certain procedural rights in renewal proceedings, and providing that this section shall be deemed a part of each teaching contract, gives all teachers a property interest in continued employment absent sufficient cause for nonrenewal of the contract; and as there is a property interest, there is thus a right to procedural due process, and the specific procedural rights given by this section do not limit the requirement of just and sufficient cause for nonrenewal or indicate that a hearing on the matter can be had with anything less than the procedural due process rights associated with the suspension and dismissal of teachers under this section.

        The term "conduct unbecoming a teacher," in subsec. (c) of this section, is imprecise and apparently used to cover disqualifying conduct not otherwise specifically forbidden by that subsection, and although it is validly and properly applied to serious misconduct unprotected by constitutional safeguards, it cannot be used to stifle teacher's fundamental right to petition.

       <p>
        Where dismissal of teacher was primarily for involving herself in student petition to school board requesting time off from school in order to hold symposium or class discussions concerning American involvement in Southeast Asia and particularly Cambodia, dismissal related inextricably to teacher's exercise of her right to petition and was beyond school board's authority.

        It is implicit in the power the educational law confides in the boards of school directors that authority may be delegated to subordinate officials, including superintendents, principals, and teachers, and the orders of those subordinates will be enforced by the courts if reasonable and consistent with valid school board policy and within statutory limits. In re Davenport, 129 Vt. 546, 283 A.2d 452 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        That orders teachers disobeyed come from principal did not prevent teachers' dismissals under subsec. (c) of this section on ground that that subsection only mentions orders of the superintendent and school board, as school board could delegate authority to principal.

        There was no violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendment rights of teachers dismissed under "failure to attend to duties" and "failure to carry out reasonable orders" of their principal grounds of subsec.

       <p>
        Hearings held upon suspension or dismissal of a teacher or nonrenewal of a teacher's contract, provided for by this section, must be full, fair, and impartial, and teacher has the right to have the burden of persuasion cast upon the one who would suspend or dismiss teacher or decide not to renew the contract. Burroughs v. West Windsor Board of School Directors, 138 Vt. 575, 420 A.2d 861 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Teachers suspended by superintendent upon direction of school board and dismissed following hearing on appeal to school board were entitled to a full, fair, and impartial hearing before a tribunal entertaining no bias against them, and any actual prejudice to the point of precluding an unbiased hearing arising from fact that dismissing tribunal had previously directed suspension would constitute a denial of constitutional right, and such denial could not be overcome by necessity of placing both administrative and judicial functions in school board. In re Davenport, 129 Vt. 546, 283 A.2d 452 (1971).
       </p>
       <p>
        Neither fact of school board's prior direction to superintendent to suspend teachers, nor a claim of prejudgment therefrom, would, of itself, work a judicial disqualification precluding board from hearing teachers' appeals and dismissing teachers.

        Where a petition for extraordinary relief was brought by teacher against school board for failure to renew her teaching contract, the teacher's case was properly viewed as a petition to the Superior Court for review under V.R.C.P. 75, governing review of governmental action in the nature of a writ of certiorari, since the Supreme Court has held that review of school board decisions under this section may be obtained by a writ of certiorari as provided by 4 V.S.A.

        Because the Legislature intended a teacher to exhaust the pre-termination procedures provided in the statute governing suspension and dismissal of teachers prior to availing himself or herself of judicial remedies or alternative grievance procedures, such as those negotiated in a collective bargaining agreement (CBA), the trial court properly barred a teacher from using the grievance-and-arbitration procedure contained in the CBA on the ground that he and his union had not exhausted their statutory remedies as required by the statute.

        Statute governing the agenda for labor relations for teachers and administrators authorizes schools and teachers' representatives to negotiate various terms of employment, including procedures for processing complaints and grievances relating to employment; it does not authorize parties to negotiate terms that would contravene the provisions of the statute governing the suspension and dismissal of teachers. The only provision in the latter statute that is subject to negotiation is the provision that deals with the nonrenewal of a teacher's contract; if the Legislature intended to make the entirety of the suspension and dismissal statute subject to negotiation, it would have explicitly included "unless otherwise negotiated" in each subsection or in an introductory subsection that applied to the section as whole.

     §
    
    1, provided: "Any member who retired under the provisions of the state teacher's retirement system of Vermont prior to July 1, 1974 shall receive a retirement allowance of not less than $2,600.00 a year or 50 percent of his average final compensation, whichever is larger, for any member or beneficiary who has completed thirty-five years of creditable service, nor less than a proportionate amount thereof for any member or beneficiary who has completed less than 35 years of creditable service.
    For this purpose any annuity derived from the contributions of the member transferred from the existing system under section 1934(c) of Title 16 and from additional contributions made under section 1944(b)(5) and (6) of Title 16 shall not be included as part of the retirement allowance.
    This minimum allowance shall be the amount calculated to be payable under the provisions of option 1 of the system as provided by section 1941(a) of Title 16.
    If the member elected to receive his retirement allowance under the provisions of any other optional form of benefit, the allowance shall be reduced in accordance to the provisions of the elected option."

       Upon notice not later than 90 days subsequent to the date the member may have separated from service, any member who has had five or more years of creditable service and has served as a teacher in the State during the five years immediately preceding the date of such separation from service, may be retired by the Board of Trustees on a disability retirement allowance on the first day of the calendar month next following receipt of application, provided such application is filed not less than 30 nor more than one 180 days subsequent to the filing of such notice, or on the first day of the calendar month next following the member's separation from service provided such application is filed prior to such separation, and further provided that the Medical Board, after a medical examination of such member, shall certify that the member is mentally or physically incapacitated for ordinary service; and, if previously separated from service, that such incapacity has existed since the time of the member's separation from such service; and that such incapacity is likely to be permanent.
      </li>
      <li id="t16p03c55s1938ol1b">
       Anything to the contrary notwithstanding, should the Board of Trustees of the State Teachers' Retirement System determine, within its sole discretion, that a member of said System had failed for good cause to file the notice or application required by subsection (a) of this section, within the time limits prescribed, said Board may permit the filing of such notice or application at any time prior to termination of membership and may thereupon act upon such notice or application as if it had been filed within the time limits prescribed by the subsection.
      </li>
      <li id="t16p03c55s1938ol1c">
       Upon disability retirement a member shall receive a service retirement equal to the normal retirement benefit accrued to the effective date of the disability retirement, provided, however, that such allowance shall not be less than 25 percent of his or her average final compensation at the time of his or her disability.
      </li>
      <li id="t16p03c55s1938ol1d">
       Once each year during the first five years following the retirement of a member on a disability retirement allowance, and once in every three-year period thereafter, the Board of Trustees may, and upon his or her application shall, require any disability beneficiary who has not reached his or her normal retirement date to undergo a medical examination by a Medical Board or by a physician or physicians designated by the Medical Board, such examination to be made at the place of residence of such beneficiary or other place mutually agreed upon. Should any disability beneficiary who has not reached his or her normal retirement date refuse to submit to such medical examination, his or her allowance may be discontinued until his or her withdrawal of such refusal, and should his or her refusal continue for one year, all his or her rights in and to his or her pension may be revoked by the Board of Trustees.
      </li>
      <li id="t16p03c55s1938ol1e">
       Should the Medical Board report and certify to the Board of Trustees that any disability beneficiary has a residual functional capacity that might enable the beneficiary to return to work, and should the Board of Trustees reasonably conclude that the beneficiary is engaged in or is, as a result of specific findings made by a certified vocational counselor, able to engage in a gainful occupation paying more than the difference between the beneficiary's retirement allowance and his or her average final compensation at retirement, the beneficiary's pension may be reduced to an amount that, together with his or her annuity and the amount earnable by him or her, shall equal the beneficiary's average final compensation at retirement, adjusted for inflation each year following retirement, provided that:
       <ol>
        <li id="t16p03c55s1938ol1e1">
         The Board of Trustees shall provide written notice and an opportunity to be heard to the beneficiary prior to any reduction of the beneficiary's pension under this subsection.

        <li id="t16p03c55s1938ol1e2">
         If the beneficiary has engaged in a gainful occupation subsequent to receiving disability retirement, the Board of Trustees in its discretion may reject in whole or in part a vocational assessment of the beneficiary's ability to engage in a more gainful occupation and may rely in whole or in part on evidence of the beneficiary's actual earnings in determining the amount earnable by the beneficiary. In addition, if the Board of Trustees' determination is based in whole or in part on a vocational assessment of the ability to engage in a gainful occupation, the beneficiary shall be given a reasonable opportunity, not to exceed two years, to seek gainful occupation prior to any change in his or her retirement allowance. Not later than 60 days before the change in retirement allowance is to occur, at the conclusion of the period of a reasonable opportunity to seek gainful occupation, the beneficiary may petition the Board of Trustees for an extension of that period. An extension will be granted only where the beneficiary can demonstrate reasonable diligence in seeking gainful employment and that a substantial hardship will result from a change in the retirement allowance. The Board of Trustees shall render a decision at least five days before the change in retirement allowance is set to occur. In the event that the beneficiary is subsequently restored to service as a teacher as set forth in subsection 1939(a) of this chapter, the beneficiary's retirement allowance shall cease, effective on the date when reemployment commences.

      <li id="t16p03c55s1938ol1f">
       Every recipient of disability benefits who has not reached his or her normal retirement date shall, annually on a date determined by the Board of Trustees, file with the State Treasurer a statement certifying, under penalty of perjury and in such form as the Board of Trustees shall prescribe, the full amount of his or her earnings from earned income during the preceding calendar year. The State Treasurer may request, and the beneficiary shall provide within 60 days after such request, additional financial information and records pertinent to the beneficiary's earned income. The beneficiary's statement and accompanying forms and schedules and any other financial information and records provided by the beneficiary to the State Treasurer shall be confidential. In the event that a beneficiary fails to submit the certification or any required or requested financial information or records pertinent to the beneficiary's earned income, the beneficiary's retirement allowance shall be suspended until all such information and records have been submitted, and in the event that the failure continues for one year, the suspension shall include all the beneficiary's rights in and to his or her pension. Notwithstanding any provision of this section to the contrary, if the beneficiary's earned income for the preceding year exceeded the difference between the beneficiary's retirement allowance and his or her average final compensation at retirement, adjusted for inflation each year following retirement, the beneficiary shall refund the portion of the preceding year's retirement allowance that is equal to the amount of the reduction specified in subsection (e) of this section, and the refund amount may be offset against the beneficiary's monthly pension benefits. Prior to suspension or revocation of the beneficiary's retirement allowance, reemployment rights, or inception of any offset under this subsection, the Board of Trustees shall provide the beneficiary with written notice and an opportunity to be heard.
      </li>
      <li id="t16p03c55s1938ol1g">
       If a disability beneficiary engages in gainful occupation paying more than the difference between his or her retirement allowance and his or her average final compensation at retirement, the Board of Trustees may, under uniform standards of economic need, reduce and from time to time adjust his or her pension to an amount that, together with his or her annuity and the amount earnable by him or her, equals his or her average final compensation at retirement. For the purposes of this subsection, "retirement allowance" means the allowance payable without optional modification as provided in section 1941 of this title, and does not include any part of the annuity not provided by the regular contributions of the member at the rate provided under subdivision 1944(b)(2) of this title.

This language is significant, revealing as it does a clear intent that the agency decision shall be considered "final" solely for purposes of administrative exhaustion and ripeness for subsequent judicial review, not as a bar to such review.

Such retirement allowance to the surviving beneficiary shall be in lieu of the payment of the member's accumulated contributions provided under subsection 1940(b) of this title; provided, however, that the surviving beneficiary may elect to receive payment of the member's accumulated contributions in lieu of such retirement allowance or may elect to convert the retirement allowance otherwise payable to the member into an actuarial equivalent under the provisions of option 2 of this section. Failing an eligible surviving beneficiary, the member's accumulated contributions shall be payable in accordance with the provisions of subsection 1940(b) of this title.

    <cite class="vt-code">1987, No. 92</cite>,
    
     §
    
    1, eff. June 23, 1987, provides: "The general assembly recognizes that ex officio officers are sometimes unable to attend meetings of boards and commissions on which they serve.
    If an ex officio officer is unable to attend such a meeting it is desirable that the officer designate a person to attend the meeting in his or her place so that the board or commission will not be hampered in its ability to perform its function.
    Nevertheless, when the general assembly provides that the head of a department or agency or a constitutional officer serves as an ex officio member of a state board or commission, it intends that the holder of such office attend all meetings of that board or commission unless unable to do so.
    The General Assembly does not intend by the provisions of this Act [which amended this section, section 471 of Title 3, section 382 of Title 10 and section 5062 of Title 24] to encourage ex officio officers to avoid performing their statutory duties."

        Trial court did not err in upholding the Retirement Board's rejection of plaintiffs' request for administrative relief under this section because, in concluding that considerations of timeliness, proof, and the Fund's financial integrity militated against the granting of administrative relief, the Board acted well within its broad discretion, and there was no basis to conclude that its ruling was patently arbitrary or contrary to law.

       For all Group A members, as of June 30 in each year, beginning June 30, 1972, the Board shall determine any increase or decrease, to the nearest one-tenth of one percent, in the ratio of the average of the Consumer Price Index for the month ending on that date to the average of the Index for the month ending on June 30, 1971, or the month ending on June 30 of the most recent year thereafter. In the event of an increase, and provided that the net increase following the application of any offset as provided in this subsection equals or exceeds one percent, the retirement allowance of each beneficiary in receipt of an allowance for at least one year on the next following December 31 shall be increased by an equal percentage. Such increase shall begin on the January 1 immediately following that December 31. An equivalent percentage increase shall also be made in the retirement allowance payable to a beneficiary in receipt of an allowance under an optional election, provided the member on whose account the allowance is payable and such other person shall have received a total of at least 12 monthly payments by such December 31. In the event of a decrease of the Consumer Price Index as of June 30 for the preceding year, the retirement allowance of a beneficiary shall not be subject to any adjustment on the next following January 1; provided, however, that:

        <li id="t16p03c55s1949ol1a1">

       For Group C members, as of June 30 in each year, commencing June 30, 1981, a determination shall be made of any increase or decrease, to the nearest one-tenth of a percent of the Consumer Price Index for the preceding fiscal year. In the event of an increase, and provided that there exists a net increase following the application of any offset as provided in this subsection, the retirement allowance of each beneficiary in receipt of an allowance for at least one year on the next following December 31 shall be increased by an amount equal to one-half of the net percentage increase. The increase shall commence on the January 1 immediately following that December 31. The increase shall apply to Group C members having attained 57 years of age or completed at least 25 years of creditable service as of June 30, 2010, and receiving an early retirement allowance only in the year following attainment of age 62, and shall apply to Group C members not having attained 57 years of age or having completed at least 25 years of creditable service as of June 30, 2010, and receiving an early retirement allowance only in the year following the member's attainment of 65 years of age, provided the member has received benefits for at least 12 months as of December 31 of the year preceding any January adjustment. In the event of a decrease of the Consumer Price Index as of June 30 for the preceding year, the retirement allowance of a beneficiary shall not be subject to any adjustment on the next following January 1; provided, however, that:

       <p>
        Statute governing the agenda for labor relations for teachers and administrators authorizes schools and teachers' representatives to negotiate various terms of employment, including procedures for processing complaints and grievances relating to employment; it does not authorize parties to negotiate terms that would contravene the provisions of the statute governing the suspension and dismissal of teachers. The only provision in the latter statute that is subject to negotiation is the provision which deals with the nonrenewal of a teacher's contract; if the Legislature intended to make the entirety of the suspension and dismissal statute subject to negotiation, it would have explicitly included "unless otherwise negotiated" in each subsection or in an introductory subsection that applied to the section as whole.

      1.
    To improve their respective school systems by utilizing the teacher or other professional educational person wherever educated, declare that it is the policy of each of them, on the basis of cooperation with one another, to take advantage of the preparation and experience of such persons wherever gained, thereby serving the best interests of society, of education, and of the teaching profession.
    It is the purpose of this Agreement to provide for the development and execution of such programs of cooperation as will facilitate the movement of teachers and other professional educational personnel among the States party to it and to authorize specific interstate educational personnel contracts to achieve that end.
     </p>
     <p>
      2.
    The party States find that included in the large movement of population among all sections of the nation are many qualified educational personnel who move for family and other personal reasons but who are hindered in using their professional skill and experience in their new locations. Variations from State to State in requirements for qualifying educational personnel discourage such personnel from taking the steps necessary to qualify in other States.
    As a consequence, a significant number of professionally prepared and experienced educators is lost to our school systems. Facilitating the employment of qualified educational personnel, without reference to their States of origin, can increase the available educational resources.
    Participation in this Compact can increase the availability of educational manpower.

        Permissive portion of this section, which provides, inter alia, that Trustees may appoint necessary officers for each institution under its control, professors and instructors and any other necessary members of staff and prescribe their duties, salaries, and terms of office implicates matters which form the very heart of the collective bargaining process.

        §
        904(a), requiring collective bargaining for matters prescribed or controlled by statute, precludes collective bargaining only where outcome of any negotiations has been statutorily predetermined or expressly committed to the discretion of one party, and Legislature did neither by providing under this section that Trustees of Vermont State Colleges could appoint professors and prescribe their duties, salaries, and terms of office; consequently, the issues of tenure and promotion of faculty members are properly bargainable.

        Collective bargaining agreement under which final authority concerning promotion and tenure of faculty was lodged in the presidents of the member colleges of Vermont State Colleges did not prevent trustees from promulgating, under this section and section 2175 of this title, qualitative criteria, setting numerical limits, or otherwise limiting promotion or tenure, but required that the standards promulgated by the trustees be applied in particular cases by the college presidents, whose determinations were to be final.

       The Vermont State Colleges may create and establish one or more special funds, referred to in this section as "debt service reserve funds," and shall pay into each debt service reserve fund:

       All monies held in any debt service reserve fund, except as provided in this section, shall be used, as required, solely for the payment of the principal or purchase or redemption price of or interest or redemption premium on bonds or notes secured in whole or in part by the fund or of sinking fund payments with respect to the bonds or notes; provided, however, that monies in any fund shall not be withdrawn from the fund at any time in an amount as would reduce the amount of the fund to less than the debt service reserve requirement established by resolution of the Vermont State Colleges for the fund as hereafter provided, except for the purpose of making payments, when due, of principal, interest, redemption premiums, and sinking fund payments with respect to bonds and notes secured in whole or in part by the fund for the payment of which other monies of the Vermont State Colleges are not available. Any income or interest earned by any debt service reserve fund may be transferred to other funds or accounts of the Vermont State Colleges to the extent that it does not reduce the amount of the fund below the requirement for the fund.

       The Vermont State Colleges shall not at any time issue bonds or notes secured in whole or in part by a debt service reserve fund if upon the issuance of the bonds or notes the amount in the debt service reserve fund will be less than the debt service reserve requirement established by resolution of the Vermont State Colleges for the fund, unless the Vermont State Colleges at the time of issuance of the bonds or notes shall deposit in the fund from the proceeds of the bonds or notes so to be issued, or from other sources, an amount that, together with the amount then in the fund, will not be less than the debt service reserve requirement established for the fund. The debt service reserve requirement for any debt service reserve fund shall be established by resolution of the Vermont State Colleges prior to the issuance of any bonds or notes secured in whole or in part by the fund and shall not be required to exceed "maximum debt service," which shall mean, as of any particular date of computation, an amount equal to the greatest of the respective amounts, for the then-current or any future fiscal year of the Vermont State Colleges, of annual debt service on the bonds and notes of the Vermont State Colleges secured or to be secured in whole or in part by the debt service reserve fund.

       In order to ensure the maintenance of the debt service reserve requirement in each debt service reserve fund established by the Vermont State Colleges, there may be appropriated annually and paid to the Vermont State Colleges for deposit in each fund the sum as shall be certified by the Chair of the Board of Trustees of the Vermont State Colleges to the Governor, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House as is necessary to restore each such debt service reserve fund to an amount equal to the debt service reserve requirement for the fund. The Chair shall annually, on or about February 1, make and deliver to the Governor, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House his or her certificate stating the sum required to restore each debt service reserve fund to the amount equal to the debt service reserve requirement for the fund, and the sum so certified may be appropriated, and if appropriated, shall be paid to the Vermont State Colleges during the then-current State fiscal year. The principal amount of bonds or notes outstanding at any one time and secured in whole or in part by a debt service reserve fund to which State funds may be appropriated pursuant to this subsection shall not exceed $34,000,000.00, provided that the foregoing shall not impair the obligation of any contract or contracts entered into by the Vermont State Colleges in contravention of the Constitution of the United States of America.

     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     School authorities have absolute discretion in determining whether a student has been delinquent in his studies. Connelly v. University of Vermont and State Agricultural College, 244 F. Supp. 156 (D. Vt. 1965).
    </p>
    <p>
     Rule of judicial nonintervention in scholastic affairs is particularly applicable in case of medical school, which must be the judge of student qualifications, as courts are not supposed to be learned in medicine and are not qualified to pass opinion to attainments of students in medicine. Connelly v. University of Vermont and State Agricultural College, 244 F. Supp. 156 (D. Vt. 1965).
    </p>
    <p>
     College student dismissal, motivated by bad faith, arbitrariness, or capriciousness, may be actionable. Connelly v. University of Vermont and State Agricultural College, 244 F. Supp. 156 (D. Vt. 1965).
    </p>
    <p>
     If it were determined that instructor in State College of Medicine acted arbitrarily, capriciously, or in bad faith in failing student, court could order university to give dismissed medical student fair and impartial hearing on his dismissal order. Connelly v. University of Vermont and State Agricultural College, 244 F. Supp. 156 (D. Vt. 1965).
    </p>
    <p>
     Whether dismissed medical student should or should not have received passing grade for period in question was matter wholly within jurisdiction of school authorities who alone were qualified to make determination, and allegation that university student should have received a passing grade was not subject for judicial review and complaint failed to state claim upon which relief could be granted. Connelly v. University of Vermont and State Agricultural College, 244 F. Supp. 156 (D. Vt. 1965).

        Record contained ample competent evidence to support the determination of the University of Vermont (UVM) under its regulations that plaintiff was ineligible for in-state tuition status when plaintiff admitted in an earlier application for in-state status that he came to Vermont with the plan and intent not only to obtain an undergraduate degree, but thereafter to attend medical school; he applied to the UVM medical school while still enrolled as an undergraduate; and he enrolled as a medical student within one year after completing his undergraduate coursework. Furthermore, there was sufficient evidence that plaintiff was supported by his family in that he had acknowledged the receipt of financial support in a previous application for in-state status; his educational trust fund had increased during the previous year from $3,000 to $50,000 with no indication as to the source of the funds; his father was listed as the co-purchaser and co-borrower when plaintiff bought his residence; and his annual income was insufficient to fund the home purchase, trust fund, and education costs.

         1. Constitutionality.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Because the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College (UVM) is an instrumentality of the State whose officials wield governmental authority, in enacting the statute empowering the trustees of UVM to create a police force, the Legislature properly delegated its police power to a State instrumentality. There was no plain and palpable invasion of constitutional rights resulting from the passage of the statute or the existence and operation of UVM's police department. State v. Curley-Egan, 180 Vt. 305, 910 A.2d 200 (September 1, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        When the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College (UVM) acts pursuant to this section to create a police force, its conduct is governmental action reviewable under the Vermont Rules of Civil Procedure. Thus, the complaint procedure remains transparent and subject to oversight by the Judiciary, a public governmental institution. In addition, this section does not alter UVM's exposure under federal law for misconduct by its police officers. Thus, the view that the complaint mechanism renders the UVM police department unanswerable to the people is unfounded. State v. Curley-Egan, 180 Vt. 305, 910 A.2d 200 (September 1, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section is not invalid on the basis that UVM is a State instrumentality only to the extent its activities implicate "public education issues." By ensuring a safe learning environment, a basic precondition of a successful educational institution, the UVM police department fulfills a role closely related to the educational mission of the institution. Therefore, the creation and operation of its police force implicate and promote UVM's educational mission such that UVM is properly viewed as a State instrumentality in this context. State v. Curley-Egan, 180 Vt. 305, 910 A.2d 200 (September 1, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Legislature did not exceed its constitutional authority in the delegation of statewide, as opposed to geographically limited, jurisdiction to the police force of the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College (UVM). Because UVM's public status made it a proper recipient of the Legislature's delegation of police power, the Legislature was free to allocate statewide jurisdiction to its police force. State v. Curley-Egan, 180 Vt. 305, 910 A.2d 200 (September 1, 2006).

       The University of Vermont and State Agricultural College may create and establish one or more special funds, referred to in this section as "debt service reserve funds," and shall pay into each such debt service reserve fund:
       <ol>
        <li id="t16p04c75sub03s2363ol1a1">
         any monies appropriated and made available by the State for the purpose of such fund;

      <li id="t16p04c75sub03s2363ol1b">
       All monies held in any debt service reserve fund, except as provided in this section, shall be used, as required, solely for the payment of the principal or the purchase or redemption price of or interest or redemption premium on bonds or notes secured in whole or in part by such fund or of sinking fund payments with respect to the bonds or notes; provided, however, that monies in any fund shall not be withdrawn at any time in such amount as would reduce the amount of the fund to less than the debt service reserve requirement established by resolution of the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College for the fund as hereafter provided, except for the purpose of making payments, when due, of principal, interest, redemption premiums, and sinking fund payments with respect to bonds and notes secured in whole or in part by the fund for the payment of which other monies of the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College are not available. Any income or interest earned by any debt service reserve fund may be transferred to other funds or accounts of the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College to the extent that it does not reduce the amount of the fund below the requirement for such fund.

       The University of Vermont and State Agricultural College shall not at any time issue bonds or notes secured in whole or in part by a debt service reserve fund if upon the issuance of the bonds or notes the amount in the debt service reserve fund will be less than the debt service reserve requirement established by resolution of the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College for the fund, unless the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College at the time of issuance of the bonds or notes shall deposit in the fund from the proceeds of the bonds or notes so to be issued, or from other sources, an amount that, together with the amount then in the fund, will not be less than the debt service reserve requirement established for the fund. The debt service reserve requirement for any debt service reserve fund shall be established by resolution of the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College prior to the issuance of any bonds or notes secured in whole or in part by such fund and shall not be required to exceed "maximum debt service," which shall mean, as of any particular date of computation, an amount equal to the greatest of the respective amounts, for the then-current or any future fiscal year of the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College, of annual debt service on the bonds and notes of the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College secured or to be secured in whole or in part by the debt service reserve fund.

       In order to assure the maintenance of the debt service reserve requirement in each debt service reserve fund established by the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College, there may be appropriated annually and paid to the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College for deposit in each fund the sum as shall be certified by the Chair of the Board of Trustees of the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College to the Governor, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House as is necessary to restore each debt service reserve fund to an amount equal to the debt service reserve requirement for the fund. The Chair shall annually, on or about February 1, make and deliver to the Governor, the President of the Senate, and the Speaker of the House his or her certificate stating the sum required to restore each debt service reserve fund to the amount equal to the debt service reserve requirement for the fund, and the sum so certified may be appropriated and, if appropriated, shall be paid to the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College during the then-current State fiscal year. The principal amount of bonds or notes outstanding at any one time and secured in whole or in part by a debt service reserve fund to which State funds may be appropriated pursuant to this subsection shall not exceed $66,000,000.00, provided that the foregoing shall not impair the obligation of any contract or contracts entered into by the University of Vermont and State Agricultural College in contravention of the Constitution of the United States of America.

      A town, at any legal meeting of the voters, may appropriate from its general funds money to pay all or part of the tuition and incidental expenses of one or more students from the town in any institution of higher learning. When a town makes such an appropriation, a committee consisting of the superintendent of the district in which the town is located, the chair of the school board, the chair of the prudential committee, if any, in the town, and the principals of each high school and academy in the town, or if there is not a high school or academy, the principal of the high school usually attended by the resident students shall constitute a board of selection. On or before August 1 following an appropriation, the board shall designate, on the basis of scholarship and need, the number of students authorized by the appropriation. The choice of the institution shall be made by each student receiving a scholarship.

Any state so withdrawing, unless reinstated, shall cease to have any claim to or ownership of any of the property held by or vested in the board or to any of the funds of the board held under the terms of the compact.
    Thereafter, the withdrawing state may be reinstated by application after appropriate legislation is enacted by such state, upon approval by a majority vote of the board.

       Statement of policy.
    
    The ability to read is critical to success in learning. Children who fail to read by the end of the first grade will likely fall further behind in school. The personal and economic costs of reading failure are enormous both while the student remains in school and long afterward. All students need to receive systematic reading instruction in the early grades from a teacher who is skilled in teaching reading through a variety of instructional strategies that take into account the different learning styles and language backgrounds of the students. Some students may require intensive supplemental instruction tailored to the unique difficulties encountered.

    The State Board of Education, in collaboration with the Agency of Human Services, higher education, literacy organizations, and others, shall develop a plan for establishing a comprehensive system of services for early education in the first three grades to ensure that all students learn to read by the end of the third grade. The plan shall be updated at least once every five years following its initial submission in 1998.

    <p>
     "(a) The general assembly finds that:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(1) School districts are working hard to control special education costs while continuing to provide appropriate services that meet the needs of all Vermont students.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) Nevertheless, special education costs are increasing more rapidly than general education costs and this rate of increase should be moderated to an extent consistent with meeting the educational needs of students. The increase in special education costs is due to many complex factors, including an increase in the percentage of students found eligible for special education services as well as an increase in the proportion of those special education students who need very expensive services.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(3) The blue ribbon commission on special education costs and the fiscal review panel found that strengthening the educational support systems across the state, improving the consistency of the delivery of special education throughout the state, improving the recruitment, training and retention of special education teachers and administrators, and improving the ability of all teachers and administrators to meet the educational needs of all students could help districts to control special education costs.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(4) Early prevention and intervention services targeted to children who are at risk of becoming special education eligible can reduce the number of students who will eventually need special education services.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(5) Early prevention and intervention services are often less expensive than special education services, and may only be necessary for a short time in order to enable a student to succeed in the general education environment.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(6) The department of education should provide more technical and legal assistance to help school districts control special education costs and improve educational outcomes for students.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(7) In its work with school districts, the department of education should emphasize effective and efficient management of delivering special education services statewide.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(b) Therefore, it is the intent of the general assembly to provide services that will help school districts to contain increases in total special education spending in Vermont, while continuing to deliver appropriate services that meet the needs of Vermont's students."

The base amounts for each supervisory union for fiscal years 2024, 2025, and 2026 shall move gradually the supervisory union's fiscal year 2023 base amount to the fiscal year 2027 uniform base amount by prorating the change between the supervisory union's fiscal year 2023 base amount and the fiscal year 2027 uniform base amount over this three-fiscal-year period.

      Section 2973 effective July 1, 2023; see also section 2973 effective until July 1, 2023 set out above.
      <br/>
     </p>
     <p>
      (a) (1)
    Notwithstanding any provision of law to the contrary, an approved independent school that accepts public tuition shall enroll any student with an individualized education program who requires special education services and who is placed in the approved independent school as an appropriate placement and least restrictive environment for the student by the student's individualized education program team or by the local education agency (LEA); provided, however, that this requirement shall not apply to an independent school that limits enrollment to students who are on an individualized education program or a plan under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, and who are enrolled pursuant to a written agreement between the LEA and the school.
     </p>
     <p>
      (2) In placing a student with an independent school under subdivision (1) of this subsection, the student's individualized education program team and the LEA shall comply with all applicable federal and State requirements.
     </p>
     <p>
      (3) An approved independent school is not required to demonstrate that it has the resources to serve every category of special education as defined under State Board of Education rules in order to be approved or retain its approval to receive public funding for general tuition.
     </p>
     <p>
      (4) The terms "special education services," "LEA," and "individualized education program" or "IEP" as used in this section shall have the same meanings as defined by State Board rules.
     </p>
     <p>
      (b) (1)
    The Secretary of Education shall establish minimum standards of services for students receiving special education services in independent schools in Vermont and may advise independent schools as to the need for certain special education services in Vermont.
     </p>
     <p>
      (2) (A) The Secretary of Education shall set, after consultation with independent schools in Vermont, and based on the level of services provided by the schools, the maximum rates to be paid by the Agency and supervisory unions or school districts for tuition, room, and board for residential placement of students who require special education services. The amount charged by an independent school for tuition shall reflect the school's actual or anticipated costs of providing special education services to the student and shall not exceed the maximum rates set by the Secretary, provided that the Secretary may permit charges in excess of these maximum rates where the Secretary deems warranted.
     </p>
     <p>
      (B) (i) An approved independent school that enrolls a student under subdivision (a)(1) of this section may bill the responsible LEA for excess special education costs incurred by the independent school in providing special education services beyond those covered by general tuition. Reimbursement of these excess special education costs shall be based on the direct-cost rates approved by the Secretary for services actually provided to the student consistent with the Agency of Education Technical Manual for special education cost accounting. The Agency of Education shall publish specific elements that must be included as part of an independent school's invoice for excess special education costs, and these elements shall be included in the written agreement required under subdivision (c)(2) of this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      (C) (i) The Secretary shall set, after consultation with independent schools in Vermont, the maximum tuition rates to be paid by the Agency and supervisory unions or school districts to independent schools that limit enrollment to students who are on an IEP or a plan under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, 29 U.S.C. § 794, and who are enrolled pursuant to a written agreement between the LEA and the school. The maximum tuition rates shall be based on the level of services provided by the school.

      The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009, Pub. L. No. 111-5, expanded existing and created new tax-credit bond programs available to public schools. Accordingly, school districts are authorized to issue bonds to finance public school building construction and rehabilitation, the purchase of equipment, the development of course materials, and teacher and personnel training, consistent with Sections 1397E and 54F of the Internal Revenue Code, pertaining to qualified school academy zones and qualified school construction bonds.

     <p>
      In its discretion, an educational institution may associate together for common investment the funds of individual trusts or individual funds held by it whether created by order of court or otherwise, if the terms of the trust or gift do not require a separate investment.
    For that purpose, an educational institution may create an investment account in which may be placed for investment the whole or any part of the funds of trusts or gifts permitted to be associated.
    An individual trust or gift whose funds are thus associated shall at all times be the equitable owner of its pro rata share of the funds of such investment account and the net increase or decrease of its principal during the time its funds are a part of such account.

      1. Constitutionality.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     Purpose of this chapter, creating Educational Buildings Financing Agency, which was to promote the welfare of the people of the State, was a public purpose within Vermont Constitution, chapter 2, section 68. Vermont Educational Buildings Financing Agency v. Mann, 127 Vt. 262, 247 A.2d 68 (1968), appeal dismissed, 396 U.S. 801, 90 S. Ct. 9, 24 L. Ed. 2d 58 (1969).
    </p>
    <p>
     Requirements that Educational Buildings Financing Agency report annually to executive and legislative branches all projects applied for and planned and all of its undertakings, in progress and completed, together with a financial audit, in light of fact that Agency's powers were spelled out in considerable detail, furnished sufficient standards to withstand attack that chapter constituted unlawful delegation of legislative power. Vermont Educational Buildings Financing Agency v. Mann, 127 Vt. 262, 247 A.2d 68 (1968), appeal dismissed, 396 U.S. 801, 90 S. Ct. 9, 24 L. Ed. 2d 58 (1969).
    </p>
    <p>
     Permitting church-related institution of learning to participate in assistance provided by Educational Buildings Financing Act did not unconstitutionally serve the cause of religion in light of facts that administration of chapter involved no power to appropriate public funds, that college was financed from tuition and gifts and received no financial assistance from the church, and that church had no proprietary interest in reversion, or otherwise, in college property. Vermont Educational Buildings Financing Agency v. Mann, 127 Vt. 262, 247 A.2d 68 (1968), appeal dismissed, 396 U.S. 801, 90 S. Ct. 9, 24 L. Ed. 2d 58 (1969).

       The Agency is authorized to issue from time to time bonds or notes of the Agency for the purposes authorized by this chapter and refunding bonds for the purpose of refunding any bonds issued by the Agency under this chapter, including the payment of any redemption premium thereon and any interest accrued or to accrue to the date of the redemption of such bonds, irrespective of whether the bonds to be refunded have or have not matured. Refunding bonds may also be issued by the Agency for the purpose of refunding any bonds, including refunding bonds, issued by the Agency under this chapter and paying all or any part of the cost of acquiring or constructing any facilities. The issuance of the refunding bonds, the maturities and other details thereof, the rights and remedies of the holders thereof and the rights, powers, privileges, and obligations of the Agency with respect to the same shall be governed to the fullest extent feasible by the provisions of this chapter pertaining to bonds. The Agency may also issue its negotiable bonds for the purpose of paying or otherwise satisfying in accordance with their terms any bonds, mortgages, notes, loans, or other contractual obligations of any eligible institution assigned or transferred to or assumed by the Agency in connection with financing the acquisition by the Agency of any facilities from such eligible institution. Except as may otherwise be expressly provided by the Agency, bonds and notes issued under this chapter shall be general obligations, payable out of any monies or revenues of the Agency, subject only to any agreements with the holders of the bonds or notes pledging any particular monies or revenues. Notwithstanding any of the provisions of this chapter or any recitals in any bonds or notes issued under this chapter, all bonds, notes, and interest coupons appertaining to them shall have and are hereby declared to have all the qualities and incidents, including negotiability, of investment securities under the Uniform Commercial Code, but no provision of such code respecting the filing of a financing statement to perfect a security interest shall be applicable to any security interest created in connection with the issuance of any bonds or notes. No bonds or notes of the Agency may be issued to acquire or construct any facilities unless the Agency first certifies to the Governor that in its opinion such facilities are needed and will provide adequate revenue derived from rents or otherwise to repay the bonds and the interest thereon when due.

      <li id="t16p06c131s3856ol1b">
       The bonds shall be authorized by resolution of the board, be in such denominations and bear such date or dates, mature at such time or times not exceeding 40 years from their respective dates, be in such forms, either coupon or registered, carry such registration privileges, be executed in such manner, be payable in such medium of payment at such place or places, and be subject to such terms of redemption as the Agency may provide by resolution or in the trust indenture.
    If any officer whose signature or a facsimile thereof appears on any bonds, notes, or coupons ceases to be that officer before the delivery of the bonds or notes, the signature or facsimile shall nevertheless be valid and sufficient for all purposes as if he or she had remained in office until the delivery, and any bond or note may bear the facsimile signature of or may be signed by that person although at the date of the bond or note the person may not have been that officer.
    The Agency may sell bonds in such amounts and in such manner, either at public or private sale, and for such prices as it may determine may best carry out the purposes of this chapter.

      1. Constitutionality.
     </b>
    </h5>
    <p>
     The current system for funding public education in Vermont is in violation of the State Constitution. A legitimate governmental purpose cannot be fathomed to justify the gross inequities in educational opportunities produced by this system, with its substantial dependence on local property taxes and resultant wide disparities in revenues available to local school districts. The distribution of a resource as precious as educational opportunity may not have as its determining force the mere fortuity of a child's residence. Brigham v. State, 166 Vt. 246, 692 A.2d 384 (1997), (decided under facts existing before 1997 amendments to Title 16).
    </p>
    <p>
     While the State Constitution does not require exact equality of funding among school districts or prohibit minor disparities attributable to unavoidable local differences, it does prohibit substantial interdistrict funding disparities. Moreover, discrimination in the distribution of a constitutionally mandated right such as education may not be excused merely because a "minimal" or "adequate" level of opportunity is provided to all. The Legislature should act under the Vermont Constitution to make educational opportunity available on substantially equal terms, the specific means of discharging this broadly defined duty being properly left to its discretion. Brigham v. State, 166 Vt. 246, 692 A.2d 384 (1997), (decided under facts existing before 1997 amendments to Title 16).

        Equal Educational Property Act of 1997 is a remedial statute designed to rectify the inequality in educational opportunity in Vermont resulting from the State's heavy reliance on local property taxes to fund schools; therefore, the statute must be construed to accomplish that remedial purpose. Killington v. State, 172 Vt. 182, 776 A.2d 395 (2000).

       It is the purpose of this section to reduce the effects of annual variations in State revenues upon the Education Fund budget of the State by reserving certain surpluses in Education Fund revenues that may accrue for the purpose of offsetting deficits.

       There is hereby created an Education Fund budget stabilization reserve determined on a budgetary basis and administered by the Commissioner of Finance and Management. Any budgetary basis undesignated Education Fund surplus occurring at the close of a fiscal year shall be reserved within the Education Fund budget stabilization reserve, provided that the balance reserved shall not exceed five percent of the prior fiscal year education fund appropriations, reduced by the amount distributed to school districts by municipalities for netting purposes under <cite class="vt-code">32 V.S.A. § 5402(c)</cite>, and any additional amounts as may be authorized by the General Assembly. Any undesignated Education Fund surplus and accrued interest remaining after the Education Fund budget stabilization reserve has been brought to the maximum authorized level shall remain in the Education Fund.

If the stabilization reserve established under this section should in any fiscal year be less than 5.0 percent of the prior fiscal year's appropriations from the Education Fund, as defined in subsection (b) of this section, the Joint Fiscal Committee shall review the information provided pursuant to <cite class="vt-code">32 V.S.A. § 5402b</cite> and provide the General Assembly its recommendations for change necessary to restore the stabilization reserve to the statutory level provided in subsection (b) of this section.

        Equalized-yield provision in education funding statute did not unconstitutionally delegate legislative authority to Vermont municipalities, because all details of equalization mechanism were specified in the provision, and it did not delegate Legislature's lawmaking functions.
