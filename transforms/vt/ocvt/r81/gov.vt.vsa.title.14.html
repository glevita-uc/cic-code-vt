        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In determination of testamentary capacity, true test is whether testator had sufficient mind and memory at time of making will to remember who were natural objects of his bounty, recall to mind his property, and dispose of it understandingly according to some plan formed in his mind. In re Estate of Burt, 122 Vt. 260, 169 A.2d 32 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where lack of testamentary capacity or undue influence are grounds of contest of will, few artificial rules are applied, and, in view of many factors entering into matter, investigation must be befittingly untrammeled, and inquiries for most part must be carried on in accordance with liberal rules of procedure. In re Everett's Will, 105 Vt. 291, 166 A. 827 (1933).

       </h5>
       <p>
        If testator has an insane delusion in respect to one of his children, or other natural object of his bounty, and instrument presented for probate is product of such delusion, it is void, notwithstanding he may have had capacity to do all kinds of business not involving such delusion.

        Person adjudged a non compos and placed under guardianship as such was thereby rendered prima facie incapable of making will while adjudication remained in force. In re Cowdry's Will, 77 Vt. 359, 60 A. 141 (1905).

         5. Burden of proof.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        When proponent drew will taking entire estate or large bequest when he would have taken nothing as heir, while near, needy and deserving relatives took nothing, and no reason for devise to proponent was shown and other suspicious circumstances existed, the law regarded instrument as unnatural and cast upon proponent burden of proving that it was not procured by undue influence on his part or in his behalf. In re Barney's Will, 70 Vt. 352, 40 A. 1027 (1898).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under facts of case, burden was on proponent to prove capacity of testatrix but on contestant to prove undue influence. Denny v. Heirs of Pinney, 60 Vt. 524, 12 A. 108 (1888).
       </p>
       <p>
        That testator was of sound and disposing mind is presumed; if incapacity existed, it was for those objecting to will to show it. Dean v. Heirs of Dean, 27 Vt. 746 (1855).

         1. Name of testator signed by another.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Declaration of purported testator that copy made at his request by another of draft or memorandum of will was his will, did not show compliance with requirement that if name of testator is signed to will by another in his presence, it must be by testator's prior express direction. In re Moon's Will, 107 Vt. 92, 176 A. 410 (1935).
       </p>
       <p>
        Mere knowledge of testator that his name was being signed by another, or acquiescence or assent to signing, was insufficient. In re Moon's Will, 107 Vt. 92, 176 A. 410 (1935).

         2. Knowledge of witnesses.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        It is not necessary that witnesses to will should know character of instrument which they are attesting. In re Claflin's Will, 75 Vt. 19, 52 A. 1053 (1902).
       </p>
       <p>
        Publication of will was sufficient where testatrix and witnesses severally signed it in presence of each other, although testatrix did not personally say that it was her will, but person who drew it for her announced to the witnesses in her presence that it was, and requested them to sign it as witnesses. Denny v. Heirs of Pinney, 60 Vt. 524, 12 A. 108 (1888).
       </p>
       <p>
        Formal publication is not necessary; any communication by testator to witnesses, by words, signs, motions, or conduct, of idea that he intends to give a paper effect as his instrument is sufficient in law to constitute a publication. Dean v. Heirs of Dean, 27 Vt. 746 (1855); In re Claflin's Will, 73 Vt. 129, 50 A. 815 (1901); In re Claflin's Will, 75 Vt. 19, 52 A. 1053 (1902).

        Statutory requirement of signatures of three attesting witnesses for valid will is in accord with United States Constitution. In re Estate of Blais, 155 Vt. 650, 583 A.2d 1275 (mem.) (1990).

         4. Competency of witnesses.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        "Credible" under this section means "competent" at time of attestation under section 8 of this title. In re Potter's Will, 89 Vt. 361, 95 A. 646 (1915).
       </p>
       <p>
        Will may be attested by taxpayer of town that is a beneficiary thereunder. In re Potter's Will, 89 Vt. 361, 95 A. 646 (1915).
       </p>
       <p>
        Executor of a will who took no benefit under it was competent witness to its execution. Richardson v. Richardson, 35 Vt. 238 (1862).

         5. Presence of witnesses.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Even though two witnesses duly attested and subscribed will in testator's presence and in the presence of each other, where a third person was called in from without, to whom testator and two witnesses acknowledged their respective signatures, and who then subscribed his name as a witness in presence of testator and of other two witnesses, will was not properly witnessed. In re Pope's Will, 85 Vt. 564 (1862).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was sufficient if witnesses to will were together in presence of one another in such a way that they could see one another sign, whether they actually looked and saw or not. Heirs of Blanchard v. Heirs of Blanchard, 32 Vt. 62 (1859); In re Claflin's Will, 75 Vt. 19, 52 A. 1053 (1902).
       </p>
       <p>
        Testator's acknowledgement, in the presence of witnesses, of his signature previously affixed, is equivalent to a signing in their presence; the acknowledgment need not be in express words. Adams v. Field, 21 Vt. 256 (1849); In re Claflin's Will, 73 Vt. 129, 50 A. 815 (1901).

         6. Proof of execution.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        When from lapse of time attesting witnesses were unable to recollect all facts essential to good execution, if their signatures and that of testator were proved, an attestation clause, showing compliance with all formalities required by law, was prima facie evidence of due execution of will. In re Claflin's Will, 73 Vt. 129, 50 A. 815 (1901).
       </p>
       <p>
        Law of this state followed rule of English court of chancery, which, before a contested will could be established, required all subscribing witnesses to be examined, unless impracticable, as in cases where attesting witness was dead, insane, absent from state, or rendered incompetent subsequent to his attestation. Thornton's Executors v. Thornton's Heirs, 39 Vt. 122 (1866).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where competent testimony was introduced, only fair balance of proof was necessary to prove execution of will. Dean v. Heirs of Dean, 27 Vt. 746 (1855).
       </p>
       <p>
        Proof of due execution and attestation was admissible, though attestation clause was informal or entirely omitted, and if one of subscribing witnesses was dead, the genuineness of his signature could be proved. Dean v. Heirs of Dean, 27 Vt. 746 (1855).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Where owner of property purported to create trust inter vivos but no interest passed to beneficiary before death of settlor, intended trust was a testamentary trust and invalid, unless statutory requirements relating to validity of wills were complied with.

         8. Donatio mortis causa.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where intestate promised plaintiff to pay her after his death a certain sum per year during time she should live with him and keep his house; and consideration of promise was in part the services to be rendered and in part a desire to make a mortuary gift from motives of affection, plaintiff could recover the former but not the latter. Frost v. Administrator of Frost, 33 Vt. 639 (1861).
       </p>
       <p>
        Gift of all donor's personal property, in prospect of death, is a valid donatio mortis causa, but this is not true of a gift of real estate. Meach v. Meach, 24 Vt. 591 (1852).
       </p>
       <p>
        Delivery of property as gift, to become absolute upon decease of donor, but made while donor is in health, and without reserving to him any power of revocation, cannot be supported as a donatio causa mortis. Smith v. Kittridge, 21 Vt. 238 (1849).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where deceased in his last sickness made and delivered to his daughter his note, expressed to be for love and affection, and promising that she should have out of his estate fourteen hundred dollars, to be paid after his decease, note was void for want of legal and sufficient consideration, and could not be sustained as a donatio causa mortis. Holley v. Adams, 16 Vt. 206 (1844).

       <p>
        Where a properly signed and witnessed will was undated and consisted of ten typewritten pages, featuring handwritten red ink deletions, revisions and notations, even though the changes created some uncertainty, they were not sufficient to render the will facially invalid. Eckstein v. Estate of Dunn, 174 Vt. 575, 816 A.2d 494 (mem.) (2002).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Vermont does not have a statutory provision for holographic wills, and from this silence it is logical to infer that the legislature does not intend to exempt such handwritten wills from formal execution requirements. In re Estate of Cote, 176 Vt. 293, 848 A.2d 264 (2004).

        The mere intention or desire on the part of a testator to revoke his will, not carried into effect in method prescribed by this section, does not operate as a revocation. Heirs of Blanchard v. Heirs of Blanchard, 32 Vt. 62 (1859).

         6. Later will.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Probate court properly allowed a testator's 2006 will, which revoked her 1997 mutual will, because there was no exception to revocation where the testator had previously made a contract for mutual wills, nor was there a rule that a will made in breach of such a contract was invalid; appellant's remedy for breach of the contract to make mutual wills would be to bring a claim for breach of contract against the estate. In re Estate of Inouye, - Vt.
    - , 237 A.3d 1239 (2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where later will is relied upon to revoke will propounded, such later will must be established by same evidence as though it were presented for probate itself, and fact of revocation cannot be shown in any other way. In re Noyes' Will, 61 Vt. 14, 17 A. 743 (1888).

        A former will may revive upon destruction of a later will which operates as a revocation of former, and republication of the former will is not necessary. In re Gould's Will, 72 Vt. 316, 47 A. 1082 (1900).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether or not former will revives upon destruction of later will which operates as revocation of former, depends upon intention of testator in destruction of later will. In re Gould's Will, 72 Vt. 316, 47 A. 1082 (1900).

        Where testator executed his will, and will was not found at time of his decease, this raised a presumption of his having destroyed it with intent to revoke it, but this was a presumption of fact, merely, which might be encountered by contrary proof, and the will thus established.

        Where surviving husband after death of his wife caused document purporting to be her last will and testament to be mutilated, husband's heirs at law, contesting such alleged will after his death, were in no better position than he would have been, and were affected by his acts and declarations in same manner and to same extent as he would have been had he been contestant himself.

        Probate court had authority, in its discretion, to permit executor named in purported will to discontinue his petition for probate and to withdraw document from files of probate court for purpose of presenting it to proper court of another jurisdiction where it was alleged that testator died and that greater part of his property was located.

        Probate court was not without jurisdiction to entertain proceedings for probate of purported will because it was presented by one of two persons named therein as executors against objection and protest of the other, since such persons were not then executors and rule that executors must act jointly in matters requiring judgment was not applicable.

     <p>
      When it appears to the court that a will cannot be proven as otherwise provided by law, because one or more of the subscribing witnesses are unavailable or incapable of testifying, the court may admit the will to probate upon the testimony in person or by affidavit of at least one credible disinterested individual that the signature to the will is in the handwriting of the person whose will it purports to be, or upon other sufficient proof of the handwriting, and the will on its face complies with other legal requirements. This section shall not preclude the court, in its discretion, from requiring additional testimony of any available subscribing witness or proof of other pertinent facts and circumstances that the court deems necessary to admit the will to probate.

       <p>
        To sustain proceeding in court of chancery a real doubt or dispute must have arisen and be specified in allegations of bill, which must also show that situation of estate and its administration is such that probate court cannot seasonably and adequately handle question and that resort to court of chancery was reasonably necessary. Mansur v. Tate, 96 Vt. 373, 119 A. 882 (1923); O'Rourke v. Cleary, 104 Vt. 312, 158 A. 673 (1932).
       </p>
       <p>
        Before court of chancery takes jurisdiction of a case pending in probate court, it must decide whether any terms of will are in such doubt as to require intervention of court of chancery for purpose of giving them proper construction, and also whether terms of will are in dispute within meaning of this section. Harris v. Harris, 79 Vt. 22, 64 A. 75 (1906).
       </p>
       <p>
        Before court of chancery will take jurisdiction it must appear not only that terms of the will are doubtful or in dispute, and that orators have requisite interest, but also that something substantial will be accomplished by the intervention of that court.

       </p>
       <p>
        The courts will look to the language of the will, rather than plausible presumptions of probable purpose, to define the purposes and objectives of the testator, if it can be given effect, and will turn to matters external to the will only when that instrument gives inadequate, or ambiguous directions. In re Estate of McCoy, 126 Vt. 28, 220 A.2d 469 (1966).

       <p>
        An interpretation of a will which is advantageous to the surviving widow, though favored by the law as a matter of policy, cannot overrule the express provisions of the instrument. In re Estate of McCoy, 126 Vt. 28, 220 A.2d 469 (1966).

         12. Intention of testator.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        When construing a will, the first and chief objective is to ascertain the testator's intention from the language of the will, since, so far as such intention may be legally carried out, it governs. In re Estate of Barslow, 128 Vt. 192, 260 A.2d 374 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is the court's duty to declare and enforce testator's intention as ascertained from the will itself. In re Estate of Barslow, 128 Vt. 192, 260 A.2d 374 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        The cardinal rule of interpreting wills, to which all other rules are servient, is that from the language used the meaning intended by the testator is to be ascertained and given legal effect insofar as legally possible. In re Estate of Davis, 126 Vt. 19, 220 A.2d 726 (1966).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a testator's intention is clear, courts should not resort to canons of construction in an attempt to unravel what needs no unraveling. In re Estate of Mattison, 122 Vt. 486, 177 A.2d 230 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        In construing a will the first and chief object is to ascertain the intention of the testator, from the language used and to determine such intention, the court is to take the instrument by its four corners, consider it in all its parts, and give effect to its language read in the light of the relation of the parties concerned and the circumstances attending its execution. In re Estate of Mattison, 122 Vt. 486, 177 A.2d 230 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        In construing a will, the court is not bound by what the testator meant to say, but what he meant by what he did say. In re Estate of Mattison, 122 Vt. 486, 177 A.2d 230 (1962).

     <p>
      In judicial proceedings involving trusts under this title or estates of decedents, minors, or persons under guardianship, the following apply:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t14p01c05s202ol11">
       Persons are bound by orders binding others in the following cases:
       <ol type="A">
        <li id="t14p01c05s202ol11A">
         Orders binding the sole holder or all co-holders of a power of revocation or a presently exercisable general power of appointment, including one in the form of a power of amendment, bind other persons to the extent their interests (as objects, takers in default, or otherwise) are subject to the power.
        </li>
        <li id="t14p01c05s202ol11B">
         To the extent there is no conflict of interest between them or among persons represented, orders binding a guardian bind the person whose estate he or she controls; orders binding a trustee bind beneficiaries of the trust in proceedings to probate a will establishing or adding to a trust, to review the acts or accounts of a prior fiduciary and in proceedings involving creditors or other third parties; and orders binding a personal representative bind persons interested in the undistributed assets of a decedent's estate in actions or proceedings by or against the estate. If there is no conflict of interest and no guardian has been appointed, a parent may represent his or her minor child.

        <li id="t14p01c05s202ol11C">
         An unborn or unascertained person who is not otherwise represented is bound by an order to the extent his or her interest is adequately represented by another party having a substantially identical interest in the proceeding.

      </li>
      <li id="t14p01c05s202ol12">
       At any point in a proceeding, a Probate Division of the Superior Court may appoint a guardian ad litem to represent the interest of a minor, an incapacitated, unborn, or unascertained person, or a person whose identity or address is unknown, if the court determines that representation of the interest otherwise would be inadequate. If not precluded by conflict of interests, a guardian ad litem may be appointed to represent several persons or interests. The court shall set out its reasons for appointing a guardian ad litem as a part of the record of the proceeding.

         Statutory right of widow to one-third of deceased husband's personalty is analogous to homestead and dower rights, is to safeguard interests of wife, predicated upon sound public policy, and is highly favored by law. In re O'Rourke's Estate, 106 Vt. 327, 175 A. 24 (1934).

         The widow's right, under this section, to her share of the personal estate vests in her immediately upon the death of her husband; the property being immediately hers, the income is likewise hers, just as is the income from a widow's one-third interest in her husband's real estate.

         Right of wife to any part of husband's personal property is inchoate as long as he lives, and may be defeated by him by sale or gift made in good faith, but at his decease her inchoate right immediately becomes vested and complete. In re O'Rourke's Estate, 106 Vt. 327, 175 A. 24 (1934).

         One-third of personal estate of an intestate husband vests in his widow immediately upon his decease, and in case of decease of widow before assignment by probate court, the same passes to her legal representative. Estate of Johnson v. Estate of Johnson, 41 Vt. 467 (1868).

        <p>
         Where an intent on part of testator may be gathered that his surviving spouse shall take both a legacy and her statutory rights under this section, testator's intention will be given effect and no waiver will be required; but such an intent is conclusively excluded when testator leaves his entire estate to his widow. In re Estate of Sharon, 121 Vt. 322, 157 A.2d 475 (1960).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where testator left legacy to his widow to be in addition to her statutory rights, she did not take against will, but under it, and since testator intended that she take both, his intention was to be given effect, it not being contrary to law. In re O'Rourke's Estate, 106 Vt. 327, 175 A. 24 (1934).
        </p>
        <p>
         Widow could take statutory share under this section although given legacy under will, where testator so intended, since words "not lawfully disposed of by the deceased's last will" show that not all of personal estate could lawfully be disposed of by will, that part being the statutory share under section.

        <p>
         Neither the watch, or its chain, key and seals or the finger ring which were usually worn by a person when living, are to be deemed a part of his wearing apparel, which, after his decease, are to go to his widow; otherwise in reference to a bosom pin.

        </h5>
        <p>
         Probate court may, in its discretion, grant or deny a surviving widow's application for an allowance under this section, or make a conditional award, depending on the circumstances and the provisions made for her in her husband's will. In re Estate of Davis, 126 Vt. 19, 220 A.2d 726 (1966).
        </p>
        <p>
         The court has in all cases power to grant support to the widow and children pending settlement of an estate, whether or not there is a will, whether or not the widow waives the provisions of the will, and whether or not there is a residuary clause. In re Estate of Davis, 126 Vt. 19, 220 A.2d 726 (1966).
        </p>
        <p>
         An allowance under this section is necessary for the immediate and continuing support of the widow, etc., and the order is within the discretion of the probate court, and conclusive. Leach v. Executor of Leach, 51 Vt. 440 (1879).
        </p>
        <p>
         Amount of allowance was a matter resting in discretion of probate court, or of county court upon an appeal; and was not ordinarily subject to revision, upon exceptions, in supreme court. Heirs of Sawyer v. Sawyer, 28 Vt. 245 (1856).

        <p>
         The surviving widow does not waive her right to make application for an allowance pursuant to this section by taking under the will unless the will by clear and unequivocal language shows an intention by the testator that the provisions for his widow in the will are in lieu of her statutory allowance for support pending settlement. In re Estate of Davis, 126 Vt. 19, 220 A.2d 726 (1966).
        </p>
        <p>
         Where oratrix was bequeathed a legacy and annuity by her husband's will, and, in good faith, appealed from the allowance of the will by the probate court, and during the pendency of the appeal the probate court allowed her unconditionally a certain sum from the estate for her support, this allowance was independent of her legacy and annuity under will, and executors or heirs could not treat it as in part payment thereof.

         An allowance for support of the surviving widow pursuant to this section becomes part of the final order and decree of the probate court and is subject to appeal on the factual question of necessity and reasonableness. In re Estate of Davis, 126 Vt. 19, 220 A.2d 726 (1966).
        </p>
        <p>
         The factual issues of necessity and reasonableness, upon which an allowance for the surviving widow pursuant to this section is based, may only be reviewed by way of appeal to the county court. In re Estate of Davis, 126 Vt. 19, 220 A.2d 726 (1966).
        </p>
        <p>
         If the factual issues upon which a discretionary order of the probate court allowing support for the surviving widow are not appealed to the county court, the facts which underlie the allowance are settled and binding upon appeal to the supreme court.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Interest of wife during coverture in husband's property is not a vested interest, but is such as to give her an equitable right of action to protect her against any conveyance thereof, made by him with fraudulent intent to deprive her of such rights therein, as, by statute, would accrue to her at his decease.

       <p>
        The surviving spouse's right of dower is of such paramount importance that it is regarded as a restraint upon the exercise of another fundamental right - that of testamentary disposition, and it is beyond dispute that any effort to will away such a right must fail.

        One cannot hold property which he receives as a mere gratuity, or as heir, if the property was conveyed to him to defeat wife of deceased to her right to dower, but he will be held liable in chancery to account for property so received, and widow will be entitled to one-third part of such property.

       </p>
       <p>
        A conveyance by husband, shortly before his death, of all his property, both real and personal, to his children, without any valuable consideration, and with intent to defeat wife of her dower and her share of personal estate, securing at same time to himself possession, use and control of it during his life, is fraudulent against the claims of wife, and will be set aside. Thayer v. Thayer, 14 Vt. 107 (1842).

        Where a person seized of lands for consideration of one dollar and for love and affection, executed a deed conveying lands to his brother, and afterwards delivered deed to a third person to be kept until after grantor's death, and then to be delivered to grantee, and grantor retained possession of lands during his life, and after death of grantor deed was delivered to grantee, such deed did not operate to convey lands so as to deprive widow of her dower therein.

        When heirs of deceased husband's estate refused to pay annuity to widow, after it had been paid for several years, which annuity had been provided by an ante-nuptial agreement, and intended to be in lieu of the provisions of law, she was entitled to take a homestead and dower, the same as though no ante-nuptial agreement existed, the court never having decreed a distribution of the estate.

       <p>
        Argument that, because provisions made for widow from her husband's estate have been increased and because the legal rights of married women have been enlarged and their economic and social status improved, dower and its modern substitutes are no longer entitled to preference over unsecured creditors, is proper for consideration of legislature but may not be considered by courts unless statutes governing this matter are ambiguous.

        This section, providing in what cases widow may be barred of dower, relates to jointures or pecuniary provisions which are to take effect after decease of husband and between which and the provisions made for her by the statute an election may then be made; but it does not apply to a provision made for and received by her, completely, during the life of her husband, under an ante-nuptial contract, perfectly fair and well understood, that it shall be in lieu of every claim in her behalf against his estate.

        Since section 1 of this title gives every married woman of age and sound mind power to dispose of her real and personal estate, regardless of her husband's consent, neither validity of her will nor its probate depends on such consent being shown, and, hence, surviving husband cannot by probate of his wife's will be estopped subsequently to elect to waive its provisions and take under section 551 of this title. In re Peck's Estate, 80 Vt. 469, 68 A. 433 (1908).
       </p>
       <p>
        Right of surviving husband to waive provisions of wife's will was not affected by either his failure to object to or appeal from probate thereof; and any question as to whether he shall take under will, or under section 551 of this title in consequence of his waiver, was involved in decree of distribution and should be determined in connection therewith. In re Peck's Estate, 80 Vt. 469, 68 A. 433 (1908).

        The share of an estate which the widow elects to take by her waiver of the will is the only portion of the estate not "devised or bequeathed" upon which this section can operate. In re Estate of Copeland, 123 Vt. 32, 179 A.2d 475 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the rights of the widow are favored in the law, they do not allow her waiver to reach beyond the provisions of the will for her benefit and destroy otherwise valid testamentary dispositions insofar as the assets of the estate are sufficient to fulfill her statutory rights and the distributions under the will.

        Decedent's widow, who had waived provisions made for her in her husband's will, was entitled in her account as executrix of her husband's estate to credit for one-third of avails of sale of real estate as her statutory interest therein, notwithstanding that estate was insolvent.

        Where intestate died leaving no kindred in the direct line, either ascending or descending, but left a sister, some nephews and nieces and claimant grandchildren of a sister who deceased during his lifetime and whose mother also deceased during his lifetime, such grandchildren of a sister take by representation through their mother and maternal grandmother the share the mother would have received had she survived him.

        If intestate leaves no widow, issue, father, mother, brother, or sister living, but leaves surviving him children of his deceased brothers and sisters, and also grandchildren of deceased brothers and sisters, whose parents are also dead, his estate must be divided equally among all the children, who are living, of his deceased brothers and sisters, to the exclusion of the grandchildren, the case coming within subdivision (5) of this section.

The estate shall be for the use of schools in the towns respectively and shall be managed and disposed of like other property appropriated to the use of the town school districts. Any property decreed to a town by virtue of this chapter or subsequently conveyed to an incorporated school district within the town for the use of its schools may be sold without restriction, provided the proceeds shall be expended for the use of the schools of the town.

     <p>
      If an executor is not named in the will, or if a person dies intestate, appointments to administer the estate may be made in the following manner:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t14p03c61sub01s903ol11">
       To the surviving spouse or next of kin, or both, or the person nominated by the surviving spouse or next of kin.
      </li>
      <li id="t14p03c61sub01s903ol12">
       If the surviving spouse or next of kin or the person nominated by them is unsuitable, or if the surviving spouse or the next of kin does not within a reasonable period of time after the death of the person apply for letters of administration or nominate another person to whom letters of administration may be granted, the court may grant letters of administration to one or more of the principal creditors, if competent and willing to serve.
      </li>
      <li id="t14p03c61sub01s903ol13">
       If there is not a creditor who is competent and willing to serve, letters of administration may be issued to another person appointed by the Probate Division of the Superior Court in its discretion.
      </li>
      <li id="t14p03c61sub01s903ol14">
       If the appointment is to enable a quiet title action or another action to clear title to lands, the court may appoint a suitable person as the administrator for that purpose upon application of the reputed owner of the land formerly owned by the decedent.

       </h5>
       <p>
        "Next of kin" carries the same meaning in the statute regarding administration of an estate as it does in the wrongful death statute and in the laws of descent. Thus, because under the laws of descent, a decedent's minor child would inherit everything, she was the next of kin for purposes of the administration statute. In re Estate of Lamore, 187 Vt. 571, 989 A.2d 486 (mem.) (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is the rule at common law that the guardian of an infant who would otherwise be entitled to administration of an estate was entitled to administer the estate as a matter of right; the common law rule addresses an issue that the statute dealing with administration of estates simply fails to address, and the rule is not inconsistent with the statute. Therefore, the common law rule applies and can be used to interpret the statute. In re Estate of Lamore, 187 Vt. 571, 989 A.2d 486 (mem.) (2009).

       <p>
        Unmarried mother of a decedent's four-year-old child was properly appointed his administrator. The child was the decedent's "next of kin" under the administration statute, and under the common law, the mother, the child's guardian, stepped into the child's shoes and had the right to be appointed administrator provided that she was suitable; the mother was suitable, as her interests were directly aligned with the interests of the estate in that both sought to maximize the proceeds that could be obtained for the child in any ensuing wrongful death action. In re Estate of Lamore, 187 Vt. 571, 989 A.2d 486 (mem.) (2009).

        Neither the 1797 statute nor the current statute prescribing requirements for administrators says anything about the common law rule that the guardian of an infant who would otherwise be entitled to administration of an estate was entitled to administer the estate as a matter of right; rather, these statutes reiterate only the undisputed point that the legislature does not approve of a minor personally serving as administrator. That legislative intent is not inconsistent with allowing a minor's guardian - someone who is of lawful age - to stand in the shoes of the minor and become administrator, and the common law rule therefore remains in place.

       <p>
        Surety on bond of special administrator remains liable until trust is terminated and he has rendered his final account, unless discharged as provided by
        §
        2105 of this title, and so, where a special administrator continued to act as such after the final establishment of will which named him executor, surety on his official bond remained liable. American Surety Co. v. Gaskill's Administrator, 85 Vt. 358, 82 A. 218 (1912).

       </h5>
       <p>
        When executor is insolvent at time of appointment and is indebted to his testator, his failure to pay his debt is not a breach of trust for which a surety on his probate bond is liable; and, if in such case the executor in his accounting treats his own debt as available assets and probate court decrees distribution accordingly, surety is not bound by decree; and a court of equity has jurisdiction and will grant relief. Lyon v. Osgood, 58 Vt. 707, 7 A. 5 (1886).
       </p>
       <p>
        When an executor or administrator is indebted to testator or intestate, he must charge himself with amount due from him, if solvent, or it will be a breach of his bond. Probate Court v. Merriam, 8 Vt. 234 (1836).

        If an administrator de bonis non neglects to make an inventory of all the estate of the deceased, real and personal, which remained unadministered by the former administrator, and return the same to the court of probate within time limited by the court, it is a breach of condition of his bond.

       <p>
        Settlement before probate court does not preclude the heirs, legatees or creditors from proving that other property came into hands of administrator or executor, of which no account was rendered. Probate Court v. Merriam, 8 Vt. 234 (1836).
       </p>
       <p>
        The condition in an administrator's bond to judge of probate that administrator shall make, or cause to be made, a true and just account of his administration, is not broken by neglect in administrator to pay debts and make a distribution of estate of deceased.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      The Probate Division of the Superior Court shall regulate the conduct of persons appearing in proceedings or involved in the administration of estates or other matters within the court's jurisdiction. When it appears to the court that a person has failed to comply with procedures required by law or the Rules of Probate Procedure, or that an estate is not being promptly and properly administered, or that a fiduciary is incapable or unsuitable to discharge the trust, the court may give notice of the complaint or omission together with a notice to correct the deficiency or complaint within a specified period of time or cause the party to appear and answer the matter. Notice shall be given as provided by the Rules of Probate Procedure. The court may restrain a person from performing specified acts or the exercise of any powers or discharge of any duties of office, or make any other order to secure proper performance of duty. It may exercise the powers of contempt; tax costs, including surcharge; order a party to pay to other parties the amount of reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorney's fees, or losses incurred because of an act or omission; and remove or suspend a fiduciary.

       Termination of appointment of an executor or administrator ends the rights and powers pertaining to the office as conferred by law, the Rules of Probate Procedure, or any will or trust. Termination does not discharge an executor or administrator from liability for transactions or omissions occurring before termination, or relieve the executor or administrator of the duty to preserve assets subject to the executor's or administrator's control, or to account for and deliver assets.

       <br/>
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      When a person is absent and unheard from for five years or when a certificate of presumed death of a person has been issued under <cite class="vt-code">18 V.S.A. § 5219</cite>, that person's estate shall be subject to administration by the Probate Division of the Superior Court. If a will exists, the will shall be presented to the court and may be allowed and the estate closed thereunder. If no will is found, the court having jurisdiction of the estate may grant letters of administration thereof and proceed with the estate as in the settlement of intestate estates. Distribution of the estate shall not be made until five years after the granting of administration or letters testamentary. Before granting an order for distribution or for payment of legacies named in any will that may have been allowed, the court shall require from the legatees or distributees a bond or bonds with sufficient surety to the court, which may take into account the likelihood of the reappearance of the person presumed deceased, conditioned to return the amount distributed or paid with lawful interest thereon to the person so absent and unheard from upon reappearance and demand for the same. If the distributee or legatee is unable to give the security required by this section, the same shall be placed at interest upon security approved by the court or by the executor or administrator, as the case may be, and the interest shall be paid annually to the distributee or legatee and the estate shall remain at interest until the Probate Division of the Superior Court by which the letters of administration or letters testamentary were granted shall order it paid to the legatees or distributees. Upon motion, an order shall not be made permitting payment or distribution without the security required by this section until at least seven years have elapsed since the granting of letters testamentary or of administration on the estate of the supposed decedent.

     <p>
      When a person, hereinafter referred to as an absentee, who is serving in or with the U.S. Armed Forces, its allies, or as a crew member of a merchant vessel, has been reported or listed as missing, missing in action, interned, or beleaguered, besieged, or captured by an enemy, and has an interest in any property in this State and has not provided an adequate power of attorney authorizing another to act on the absentee's behalf in regard to the absentee's property, the Probate Division of the Superior Court may appoint a conservator to take charge of the absentee's estate under the supervision and subject to the further orders of the court. The appointment may be made upon a petition alleging the foregoing facts, showing the necessity of providing for the care of property, and may be brought by any person who would have an interest in the property if the absentee were deceased, or on the court's own motion. The court shall schedule a hearing and notice shall be given as provided by the Rules of Probate Procedure.

        Where a special administrator is not otherwise connected with the administration, he cannot relieve himself of the trust by any turning over of the property before the appointment of an executor or administrator, and where the special administrator is also named in the will as executor, the final establishment of the will does not in itself terminate the trust as special administrator.

        It was negligence on part of executor to deliver a $1000 U.S. bond, worth at time in all markets of country $1200, to each of three legatees in payment of a $1000 legacy to each, and he was liable for the loss; and this was so although the executor obtained the value placed upon the bonds by the appraisers, and was told by the probate court that he could so deliver them to the legatees for what they were appraised.

       </h5>
       <p>
        If trustee commingles trust funds with his own and loss happens by transaction, he must make good entire loss to trust fund, both as to principal and interest. In re Hodges' Estate, 66 Vt. 70, 28 A. 663 (1893).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a financial agent or attorney mixed money of his principal with his own by depositing it in his general bank account, and drew it out and used it in his own business, it was presumed that he had gained a benefit, and on failure to show how much he had derived from the use, he was chargeable for interest. Blodgett's Estate v. Converse's Estate, 60 Vt. 410, 15 A. 109 (1888).
       </p>
       <p>
        An executor was chargeable only with simple interest, although he mingled and loaned funds of estate with his own, when he did so in good faith, disclosing all profits, and, without fault or want of prudence, suffered some losses, but claimed no deduction therefor and nothing for his services, when such interest exceeded what he actually received on funds, and funds had not been used in business, trade or speculation.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Delay in recovering money of agent was negligence; and, although the masters found that administrator acted in good faith, on his best judgment, and with ordinary care and prudence, he was liable for the loss, because no actual necessity was shown for employing agent, and no sufficient cause for allowing agent to hold the money four years without suit to recover it. McCloskey v. Gleason, 56 Vt. 264 (1883).
       </p>
       <p>
        An administrator is liable for loss of avails of a note, when loss was caused by misappropriation of funds by his agent appointed by him to collect same, unless he proves, (a) that at the time he employed agent there was an actual necessity for such employment; (b) that he used the best accredited agencies; (c) that, if agent has used money collected, there was no delay in recovering it of him; (d) that in all respects he has exercised the diligence, care and prudence which a prudent man would under like circumstances; and burden of proof is on administrator.

    <p>
     This chapter limiting the presentation of claims against a decedent's estate is intended to advance the swift and orderly distribution of that estate, where that can be done without prejudicing the rights of the decedent's creditors; the objective is to assure creditors sufficient notice that the estate is being settled and fair opportunity to present their claims.

        Limitations period of tort action was not tolled by this section, where section added time to applicable statute of limitations only where notice was given to creditors under section, not where notice should have been given, tolling provision's purpose was to allow claimant opportunity to present and resolve claim without litigation, claimant had actual notice anyway, and there was no reason to give claimant more time where court had excused executor from giving notice.

     <p>
      Unless an estate is insolvent, the executor or administrator, with the consent of all heirs, devisees, and legatees, may waive any defense of limitations available to the estate.
    If the defense is not waived, no claim which was barred by any statute of limitations at the time of the decedent's death shall be allowed or paid.
    The running of any statute of limitations measured from some event other than death and advertisement for claims against a decedent is suspended during the four months following the first publication of notice under section 1201 of this title but resumes thereafter as to claims not barred pursuant to the sections which follow.
    For purposes of any statute of limitations, the proper presentation of a claim under section 1204 of this title is equivalent to commencement of a proceeding on the claim.

        Letters sent by plaintiff's attorneys did not amount to "proper presentation of a claim" within meaning of this section, for purposes of complying with statute of limitations, where first letter related to possible conflict of interest rather than statement of claim and omitted basic facts about claim, second letter was not delivered to administratrix or filed with probate court, and neither letter would have put administratrix on notice that a claim was being filed against estate.

     </h3>
     <p>
      Claims against a decedent's estate may be presented as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t14p03c66s1204ol11">
       The claimant shall deliver to the executor or administrator a written statement of the claim indicating its basis, the name and address of the claimant, and the amount claimed, and shall file a copy of the claim with the Probate Division of the Superior Court.
    The claim is deemed presented on the first to occur of receipt of the written statement of claim by the executor or administrator, or the filing of the copy of the claim with the court.
    If a claim is not yet due, the date when it will become due shall be stated.
    If the claim is contingent or unliquidated, the nature of the uncertainty shall be stated.
    If the claim is secured, the security shall be described.
    Failure to describe correctly the security, the nature of any uncertainty, and the due date of a claim not yet due does not invalidate the claim made.
      </li>
      <li id="t14p03c66s1204ol12">
       The claimant may commence a proceeding against the executor or administrator in any court where the executor or administrator may be subjected to jurisdiction, to obtain payment of the claim against the estate, but the commencement of the proceeding must occur within the time limited for presenting the claim.
    No presentation of claim is required in regard to matters claimed in proceedings against the decedent that were pending at the time of death.
      </li>
      <li id="t14p03c66s1204ol13">
       If a claim is presented under subdivision (1) of this section, no proceeding thereon may be commenced more than 60 days after the executor or administrator has mailed a notice of disallowance; but, in the case of a claim that is not presently due or that is contingent or unliquidated, the executor or administrator may consent to an extension of the 60-day period, or to avoid injustice, the court, on motion, may order an extension of the 60-day period, but in no event shall the extension run beyond the applicable statute of limitations.

        Letters sent by plaintiff's attorneys did not constitute proper presentation of claim as required by this section, and thus applicable statute of limitations was not met, where first letter related to possible conflict of interest rather than statement of claim and omitted basic facts about claim, second letter was not delivered to administratrix or filed with probate court, and neither letter would have put administratrix on notice that a claim was being filed against estate.

        No presentation of claim is required in regard to matters claimed in proceedings against the decedent which were pending at the time of his death. Kusserow v. Blue Cross-Blue Shield Plan, 140 Vt. 328, 437 A.2d 1114 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a hospital lien arises and is perfected pursuant to statute prior to the death of a decedent, perfection of the lien constitutes proceedings against the decedent pending at the time of his death, and excuses any further presentation of the claim to the executrix of the estate. Kusserow v. Blue Cross-Blue Shield Plan, 140 Vt. 328, 437 A.2d 1114 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section, which provides time limits for presentation of claims against estate which have not been presented for payment before, was inapplicable to hospital claim for payment for services rendered; hospital's claim, represented by a lien which it perfected prior to death of decedent, came within statutory exception to presentation authorized for matters claimed in proceedings against the decedent which were pending at the time of his death.

       As to claims presented in the manner described in section 1204 of this title within the time limit prescribed in section 1203 of this title, the executor or administrator shall, if a claim is disallowed, mail a notice to any claimant stating that the claim has been disallowed.
    If, after allowing or disallowing a claim, the executor or administrator changes his or her decision concerning the claim, he or she shall notify the claimant.
    The executor or administrator may not change a disallowance of a claim after the time for the claimant to file a petition for allowance or to commence a proceeding on the claim has run and the claim has been barred.

       </h5>
       <p>
        No reason appearing why matter should not follow common course or regular administration, sole heir of intestate, though there were no creditors, could not maintain a bill in equity to reach the assets of decedent's estate; but suit must be brought by administrator. Mason v. Mason's Executors, 76 Vt. 287, 56 A. 1011 (1904).

        </b>

       <p>
        Acquiescence of an administrator or guardian in a mistaken boundary line for true line did not bind heirs or wards while they remained minors. Burnell v. Malony, 36 Vt. 636 (1864).

         3. Time as bar to action by administrator.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        If administration upon estate of deceased person has been closed, and land surrendered to heirs, or if enough time has elapsed since death of intestate (in this case thirty years held to be sufficient) to show that lands are not required for purposes of administration, heirs or their grantees being in possession, cannot be disturbed by administrator. Cox v. Ingleston, 30 Vt. 258 (1858).
       </p>
       <p>
        In ejectment against heir of an intestate where action was brought by administrator who was not appointed till sixteen years after intestate's death, and who did not show that there were any debts outstanding against estate, or that intestate left any other heirs than defendant, administrator could not recover. Roberts v. Morgan, 30 Vt. 319 (1858).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where an administrator was appointed more than sixty years after death of his intestate, and sued in ejectment to recover lands which had descended to heirs of the intestate, under some of whom defendant took possession, administrator could not oust tenant claiming under heirs, nor be let into possession with them as tenant in common.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Administrator of the grantor, in a conditional deed, could maintain an action of ejectment, in his name as administrator, for a recovery of the premises upon a forfeiture of them on account of the nonperformance, by the grantees, of condition of deed. Austin v. Downer, 27 Vt. 636 (1855).
       </p>
       <p>
        An administrator may maintain an action for the recovery of the possession of real estate, for the use of the heirs, until after a decree of distribution has been made by the probate court. McFarland v. Stone, 17 Vt. 165 (1845).

      When an executor or administrator commences or prosecutes an action founded on a debt, demand, or claim for damages, and is only a trustee of the claim for the use of another person, and where the claim, although prosecuted in the name of the executor or administrator, belongs to another person, the sum or property recovered shall not be assets in the hands of the executor or administrator, but shall be paid over to the person entitled to them, after deducting or being paid the costs and expenses of the prosecution.

      A person having a contingent or other claim against a deceased person may prosecute the claim against the executor, administrator, heirs, devisees, or legatees. An action commenced against the deceased before death may be prosecuted to final judgment. A claimant having a lien on the real or personal estate of the deceased, by attachment previous to death, on obtaining judgment, may have execution against the real or personal estate.

     Survival statutes were not applicable in action brought by decedent's parents and administrator under Dram Shop Act (DSA) because DSA had its own survival provision, although court would look to interpretations of survival statutes for guidance in construing DSA survival provision.

     <p>
      In an action for the recovery of damages for a bodily hurt or injury, occasioned to the plaintiff by the act or default of the defendant or defendants, if either party dies during the pendency of the action, the action shall survive and may be prosecuted to final judgment by or against the executors or administrators of the deceased party. When there are several defendants in the action, and one or more, but not all, die, it shall be prosecuted against the surviving defendant or defendants, and against the estate of the deceased defendant or defendants.

        Where death occurs, two causes of action may arise, one in favor of decedent for his loss and suffering resulting from injury in his lifetime, the other founded on his death or on damages resulting from his death to his widow and next of kin, and both actions are to be prosecuted in point of form in name of his personal representative, but damages in the two suits are given upon entirely different principles, and for different purposes.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Devisee of land may maintain ejectment therefor when it is obvious that no action of the probate court, in ordering a division, or assigning the land, can become necessary, and there is no pretense that the executor has any lien upon the land, or so long a time has elapsed that his lien will be presumed satisfied. Abbott v. Pratt, 16 Vt. 626 (1844).
       </p>
       <p>
        Grantee of an heir holds land, as heir did, subject to administrator's lien; but, even in a case where it is shown that administration was granted upon estate, it will be presumed, after lapse of nine years without any interference of administrator, that his lien has been satisfied, especially when party denying the right of the heir's grantee is a stranger to the title. Cushman v. Jordan, 13 Vt. 597 (1841); Roberts v. Morgan, 30 Vt. 319 (1858); Austin v. Bailey, 37 Vt. 219 (1864).
       </p>
       <p>
        An heir, as such, cannot before a division, maintain ejectment or trespass quare clausum fregit, where he has had no possession; yet, all heirs conveying to plaintiff by deed, and two years elapsing, without any interference of administrator, are sufficient to presume administrator's lien upon the land satisfied, as against defendant, who appears a stranger to all title.

        Vermont's wrongful death statute does not create a new type of legal claim - it simply gives a right of recovery to a decedent's estate based on the injury to the deceased, 14 V.S.A.
        §
        1491 - the decedent's estate must still allege and prove a traditional claim for injury - in state tort law or otherwise - in order to recover. Fortunati v. Campagne, - F. Supp. 2d - (D. Vt. Dec. 29, 2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Right of action given by this section arises from injury to deceased, which, if he had survived, would have given him a cause of action. Abbott v. Abbott, 112 Vt. 449, 28 A.2d 375 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not give a new right of action, but a new right of recovery, not existing at common law, arising from the injury to the deceased which gave or would have given him a right of action if death had not ensued. Berry v. Rutland Railroad, 103 Vt. 388, 154 A. 671 (1931).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where intestate, if death had not ensued, would have had no right of action for defendant's negligence, his personal representative can have none, for the benefit of next of kin. Carty's Administrator v. Village of Winooski, 78 Vt. 104, 62 A. 45 (1905).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not create a new and additional cause of action, but provides for recovery of a new class of damages in case a right of action would have existed in the deceased person if living. Legg v. Britton, 64 Vt. 652, 24 A. 1016 (1892).
       </p>
       <p>
        If right of action is extinguished in lifetime of injured person, as by a settlement or recovery, no further recovery can be had after his death. Legg v. Britton, 64 Vt. 652, 24 A. 1016 (1892).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where injured person began suit in his lifetime, which his administrator prosecuted to judgment after his death, such judgment would bar a second suit for benefit of widow, although damages awarded in the first suit were solely for the injuries to deceased person in his lifetime. Legg v. Britton, 64 Vt. 652, 24 A. 1016 (1892).

       <p>
        A viable fetus is a "person" within meaning of section 1492 of this title and this section, even though the viable fetus is later stillborn, and a right of recovery exists for negligently causing the wrongful death of a full term viable fetus which is stillborn.

       The action shall be brought in the name of the personal representative of the deceased person and commenced within two years from the discovery of the death of the person, but if the person against whom the action accrues is out of the State, the action may be commenced within two years after the person comes into the State. After the cause of action accrues and before the two years have run, if the person against whom it accrues is absent from and resides out of the State and has no known property within the State that can by common process of law be attached, the time of his or her absence shall not be taken as part of the time limited for the commencement of the action. If the death of the decedent occurred under circumstances such that probable cause is found to charge a person with homicide, the action shall be commenced within seven years after the discovery of the death of the decedent or not more than two years after the judgment in that criminal action has become final, whichever occurs later.

        Plaintiffs were not denied equal protection because they could not recover for the wrongful death of their son, whereas parents of an adult child who dies without a surviving child are entitled to recovery. Limiting defendants' liability to one class of persons prevents the possibility of diluting the recovery.
    Limiting damages also correlates the wrongful death action to probate proceedings, as "next of kin" carries the same meaning in both laws, and as allowing damages for loss to other persons creates more opportunity for conflict between survivors, complicating and prolonging the proceedings as well as adding to their cost. Quesnel v. Town of Middlebury, 167 Vt. 252, 706 A.2d 436 (1997).

    There was no statutory or common-law cause of action for plaintiffs' injuries resulting from their son's death. Quesnel v. Town of Middlebury, 167 Vt. 252, 706 A.2d 436 (1997).

        Where parties to wrongful death action reached a settlement which provided benefits for deceased's minor child, court did not have authority under section 2643 of this title, requiring approval of release on behalf of a minor, to reject the settlement and compel the parties to go to trial, since the wrongful death claim belonged to deceased's estate and there was no cause of action of a minor subject to release, a prerequisite for operation of section 2643.

        Where death occurs, two causes of action may arise, one in favor of the decedent for his loss and suffering resulting from the injury in his lifetime, the other founded on his death, or on the damages resulting from his death to his widow and next of kin, and both actions are to be prosecuted in point of form in the name of his personal representative, but the damages in the two suits are given upon entirely different principles, and for different purposes.

        Section 1492(a) prescribes a limitation period that is necessarily determinable where facts are known and indisputable; accordingly, a claim for wrongful death must be commenced within two years of the date of decedent's death, and unlike 12 V.S.A.
        §
        512(4), which contains a discovery proviso providing that actions for personal injury shall be commenced within three years after the date of the discovery of the injury, the wrongful death statute contains no such discovery rule. Leo v. Hillman, 164 Vt. 94, 665 A.2d 572 (1995).

       <p>
        Section 557 of Title 12, providing that if one by or against whom an action may be brought dies before expiration of time within which such action may be commenced, then the period of limitation as to such action shall cease to operate at the date of death, and after issuance of letters testamentary or of administration the action, if the cause of action survives, may be commenced within two years, does not apply to a wrongful death action.

       <p>
        The purpose of the tolling provisions of wrongful death statute of limitations, which suspend the period of limitations when the defendant is out of state, is to preserve the plaintiff's right of action during the time when it is impossible to serve process personally on a defendant or attach his property within the state.

        In proving damages under this section it was permissible to show not only the earnings of deceased but also that they were largely used for his wife and children, as this relates to pecuniary injury suffered by decedent's spouse and children. Director General of Railroads v. Platt, 265 F. 918 (2d Cir. 1920).

        Intestate's cause of action cannot be taken into account in assessing damages. Needham v. Grand Trunk Railway, 38 Vt. 294 (1865).

         *18. Distribution.
        </b>
       </p>
       <p>
        In distributing the proceeds of a third wrongful-death settlement to the decedent's spouse and daughters, the trial court properly found that it was not bound by a prior order and that apportionment of the third settlement should be measured, in part, by the parties' current circumstances, which were reflected in its decision to reduce one child's percentage based on the fact that she was no longer a minor. It failed, however, to apply this principle consistently to the other beneficiaries or the proceeding as a whole by restricting the daughters' introduction of additional evidence relevant to the distribution of the third settlement in proportion to the injuries from their loss. In re Estate of Dezotell, 201 Vt. 268, 140 A.3d 797 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Wrongful death statute did not authorize a superior court to control how the proceeds from a wrongful death suit were used or invested after distribution. Here, the probate court had the powers to properly supervise the actions of fiduciaries for the protection of a minor ward; thus, the superior court should have released the settlement proceeds from a wrongful death suit to the ward's grandmother as financial guardian. In re Willey, 189 Vt. 536, 14 A.3d 954 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Distribution of proceeds in wrongful death action is determined by superior court, and while probate courts decree proceeds, their role is ministerial, to follow direction of superior court. Calhoun v. Blakely, 152 Vt. 113, 564 A.2d 590 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Proceeds from settlement of New Hampshire wrongful death action became part of decedent's estate under New Hampshire law, and probate court rather than superior court had jurisdiction to distribute proceeds. Calhoun v. Blakely, 152 Vt. 113, 564 A.2d 590 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, distribution is to be in direct proportion to pecuniary injuries suffered from wrongful death, a factor not considered in distribution of ordinary estate assets. Bassett v. Vermont Tax Dept., 135 Vt. 257, 376 A.2d 731 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        By the 1961 amendment to this section, the net proceeds of the recovery, whether by settlement or action, must be decreed by the probate court having jurisdiction of the decedent's estate, and it is mandatory that the court decree the distribution of the amount recovered pursuant to the final judgment order of the county court or superior judge. Weinstein v. Medical Center Hospital, 358 F. Supp. 297 (D. Vt. 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any moneys recovered by an administrator for wrongful death are assets in his hands, not to pay debts of deceased, but only for distribution to those entitled thereto. Abbott v. Abbott, 112 Vt. 449, 28 A.2d 375 (1942).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although administrator holds moneys recovered for wrongful death as trustee, the execution of that trust in all its details must be overseen by probate court and determined by decree of that court. Abbott v. Abbott, 112 Vt. 449, 28 A.2d 375 (1942).

       </p>
       <p>
        Prior to decree of the probate court, moneys recovered for wrongful death are held under a trust not yet terminated, and an action at law may not be maintained by a beneficiary for recovery thereof. Abbott v. Abbott, 112 Vt. 449, 28 A.2d 375 (1942).

        In wrongful death actions the administrator has the burden to produce evidence that he had entered into an agreement upon fees with counsel and himself which was fair and satisfactorily carried out, or that the compensation sought for the legal services rendered was a reasonable one under the circumstances.

       </h5>
       <p>
        It was object of this section to provide a remedy for executor or administrator, in case of an embezzlement or alienation of goods of deceased, and to take away the right of a creditor, at common law, of charging the person guilty of the embezzlement or alienation as executor de son tort.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Where defendants fraudulently concealed effects of deceased before administration granted, with intent of finally converting same to their own use, but which administrator afterwards found in their possession, it was embezzlement under this section. Spaulding v. Cook, 48 Vt. 145 (1875).
       </p>
       <p>
        To bring a case within this section, the act complained of must, at least, be done with the intent of wrongfully abstracting property from the estate of deceased, to the injury of its assets. Batchelder v. Tenney, 27 Vt. 578 (1855).
       </p>
       <p>
        To subject person to penalty under this section, he must have acted from a wrong motive, and mala fide, and is entitled to have case made out against him by full proof. Roys v. Roys, 13 Vt. 543 (1841).

        When intestate's conveyance is set aside as fraud against his creditors, defendant will not be allowed his disbursements for taxes, insurance, and payments of interest on mortgage assumed by him, where those payments were necessary to give color of good faith to fraudulent transaction.

        Expenses of such suit cannot be considered in determining whether there was a deficiency of assets when it was begun, yet, if the administrator prevails in that litigation, his expenses therein, including attorney's fees, should be satisfied out of the property fraudulently conveyed.

       <p>
        Fact that, if decedent's executor had accounted for certain personalty that came into his hands, or if his bondsmen had been sued for his failure to do so, there would have been no deficiency of assets, is no defense, for defendant cannot retain advantage of his fraud by relying on the misdoings of decedent's executor, nor is liability of an executor's bondsmen an asset of the estate.

     <p>
      When an executor or administrator considers it necessary or beneficial to sell real or personal estate, the Probate Division of the Superior Court may grant license, when it appears necessary or beneficial, under the following regulations:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t14p03c75sub02s1651ol11">
       The executor or administrator shall file a motion setting forth the facts that show the sale is necessary or beneficial.
      </li>
      <li id="t14p03c75sub02s1651ol12">
       In cases where the consent of interested persons is required, the executor or administrator shall file their written consents with the court.
      </li>
      <li id="t14p03c75sub02s1651ol13">
       In the event that the consent of interested persons is required but cannot be obtained, the court shall schedule a hearing and notice shall be given as provided in the Rules of Probate Procedure.
      </li>
      <li id="t14p03c75sub02s1651ol14">
       Before license is granted, the court may require the executor or administrator to give a new bond in an amount and with sureties as the court directs, conditioned that the executor or administrator shall account for the proceeds of the sale.
      </li>
      <li id="t14p03c75sub02s1651ol15">
       The executor or administrator shall be sworn before the court or before some other person authorized to administer oaths and a certificate thereof shall be returned to the court before sale under the order granting license.
      </li>
      <li id="t14p03c75sub02s1651ol16">
       If the evidence satisfies the court, the court may authorize the executor or administrator to sell that part of the estate deemed necessary or beneficial, either at public or private sale, and furnish the executor or administrator a copy of the license to sell or order of sale.
      </li>
      <li id="t14p03c75sub02s1651ol17">
       If the order is to sell the estate at auction, the court shall designate the manner of notice of the time and place of sale, which shall be stated in the copy of the license to sell or order of sale furnished to the executor or administrator.
      </li>
      <li id="t14p03c75sub02s1651ol18">
       The copy of the license to sell or order of sale furnished to the executor or administrator shall include findings addressing the requirements of subdivisions (1) through (4) of this section. A certified copy of the license to sell real estate or order of sale shall be recorded in the office where a deed of the real property to be sold is recorded.
      </li>
      <li id="t14p03c75sub02s1651ol19">
       If ordered by the court, the executor or administrator shall file a report with the Probate Division of the Superior Court on the action authorized by each license granted under this section within 60 days from the date of the sale of any real or personal property.
      </li>
      <li id="t14p03c75sub02s1651ol110">
       If the power to sell all or part of the testator's real or personal estate is expressly conferred by the will, the court shall issue a license to sell to the executor or administrator without requiring notice or hearing with respect to any property subject to the testamentary power, except a dwelling house in which the surviving spouse or an heir, devisee, or legatee is residing.
      </li>
      <li id="t14p03c75sub02s1651ol111">
       Notwithstanding any provision of this section, no beneficial license to sell that is inconsistent with the provisions or intent of a will shall be issued.

        Because the trial court found, and the record plainly showed, that appellant sought to defeat the plain purpose of the private nature of a sale of real property for his own planned benefit at the expense of an intestate's other heirs, the trial court properly ordered the parties to return to the status quo that existed before the sale. With all of the facts on the table, the parties could advocate, and the administrators and probate court could now decide, how best to proceed either by private or public sale, as would be most beneficial to all parties concerned. In re Estate of Doran, 187 Vt. 349, 993 A.2d 436 (2010).

        Where commissioners, who had been appointed by probate court, had no duty to report to the probate court, or seek its approval, until after the property was sold and title passed, the court's order approving the contract of sale was an intermediate step and did not finally dispose of property; there was nothing in Vermont statutes that either required or prohibited this intermediate step so that its effect was to give the commissioners an advance ruling on a question that would no doubt arise when they sought approval for their post-sale report but their power to sell property was not contingent on advance approval of the probate court. Morrisseau v. Fayette, 164 Vt. 358, 670 A.2d 820 (1995).

        A naked order or license from probate court to an administrator of a deceased person, to sell his real estate, was not sufficient to support a title derived from administrator, under such sale; but, it must appear, either from the order or from records of probate court, that such facts were found to exist, as warranted the issuing of order.

        A life tenant who paid an encumbrance was entitled to subrogation against the remainderman to extent latter was bound to pay to protect his estate, without proof of an intention to keep the mortgage on foot; and this right could be enforced by his executor, but, in such case, probate court could not grant relief, either by way of subrogation or under this section and resort must be had to court of chancery.

        A decree of the probate court, partitioning real estate among heirs, or devisees, is only conclusive as to the matter of division among them of whatever estate exists, which they have a right to have thus divided, but has no effect upon the question as to the title of the land.

        Residuary legatee, to whom executor has failed to pay amount decreed by final decree, may maintain action of tort against executor for misappropriation of money of estate that took place prior to decree, by force of section 2534 of Title 13, which makes such misappropriation a felony, such statute having been passed primarily for the protection of persons so defrauded, and to supply defect of remedy provided by this section, which, although permitting legatee to sue for his legacy, does not give body action against executor.

       <p>
        Real estate, to be regarded as advancement, must be expressed in deed to be such, or expressed to be conveyed for love and affection; and if a pecuniary consideration be expressed in deed, estate conveyed cannot be made an advancement, by merely showing that deed was in fact executed upon consideration of love and affection. Heirs of Adams v. Adams, 22 Vt. 50 (1849).

       <p>
        Where father conveyed by deed certain lands to son, and consideration expressed in it was a pecuniary one, such conveyance could not be, prima facie, taken as an advancement to son; and if parol evidence was admitted tending to prove that conveyance was in fact made for love and affection, so that it might be presumed to be an advancement, it was competent for son to rebut such evidence by showing true intent of father in making deed.

       <p>
        Declarations of an intestate, whether made at time of making entries in his book against his children, or afterwards, are inadmissible as evidence of intention of intestate in making such entries; whether such charges were intended by intestate as an advancement must be evidenced by book, and intention of intestate gathered from book, and parol testimony was inadmissible to control intention of intestate. Weatherhead v. Field, 26 Vt. 665 (1854).
       </p>
       <p>
        An entry made by a father upon a book, other than one on which he charged his accounts of debt and credit, and made in these words, "Property delivered William and Abel Brown, viz. Notes $200," etc., was held admissible as tending to prove that property specified in entry was delivered as an advancement. Brown v. Brown, 16 Vt. 197 (1844).
       </p>
       <p>
        No particular form of words was required, in an entry made by father, to show as advancement; an entry on books of deceased, of property delivered to a child, made in such a manner as to exclude idea of a debt, is evidence that it was intended as an advancement; and intention need not be expressed in entry.

       <p>
        Where a person had been deceased for over seven years, she had never conveyed a disputed lot during her lifetime, though no doubt by error, her estate had never been probated, and, at the time the petition under this section was filed, no person claiming to be her heir had attempted to or effectively conveyed their interest in the property; therefore, the probate court had proper jurisdiction over the property. Lysak v. Grull, 174 Vt. 523, 812 A.2d 840 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        A special quitclaim deed executed by an heir of the decedent several months after petitioners had filed in probate court claiming adverse possession of a disputed parcel did not defeat the jurisdiction of the court to determine title to the real estate because the deed "was a defective conveyance and of no legal effect." Lysak v. Grull, 174 Vt. 523, 812 A.2d 840 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section the probate court has specifically been given the authority to determine whether there exists an enforceable title in a deceased person, his estate, or in his heirs and, in such situations the question of adverse possession can be determined by such court. In re Estate of Allen, 129 Vt. 107, 272 A.2d 130 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section grants power to a probate court to try and determine question of title to real estate where the title to real estate is in the name of a person who has been deceased for seven years, who made no conveyance of such property during his lifetime, whose interest in such real estate has not been administered in the probate court and, in addition, where the heirs of the deceased have made no conveyance of their interest in the real estate, or if such were made, they are defective. In re Estate of Allen, 129 Vt. 107, 272 A.2d 130 (1970).

       <p>
        Probate court erred in its conclusion that petitioner acquired ownership of parcel of land by adverse possession against his fellow co-tenants; co-tenant must oust his fellow co-tenants by some overt and notorious act of an unequivocal character, indicating an assertion of ownership of the entire premises to the exclusion of the rights of others; the presumption is that one co-tenant in possession is holding the property for all co-tenants.

      If the court determines that the heirs or personal representatives of the deceased person are not at the time of the hearing in possession of the real estate and are not entitled to reenter it or to institute and maintain a suit to recover possession of it, the court shall adjudge and decree that the real estate constitutes no beneficial part of the estate of the deceased person and may appoint an administrator to convey the record title of the real estate to the person or persons adjudged by the court to be legally entitled to it.

        Because, under the Wrongful Death Act, damages are based on the loss suffered by the statutory beneficiaries, the spouse and the next of kin, these beneficiaries may not disclaim their status, in favor of the decedent's parents, by executing a disclaimer pursuant to the Uniform Disclaimer of Property Interests Act.

         2. Revocation of disclaimer.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Disclaimers under Vermont's statutory scheme are irrevocable based on claims, such as a unilateral mistake of law, that fall short of equitable claims that would support rescission of a contract or cancellation of an instrument. On the weight of the case law, by virtue of the statutory text, and out of concern for the stability of property rights, disclaimers are not revocable based on disclaimant's mistake of law or simply because the revocation is filed within the statutory time period for filing disclaimers, even if there is no prejudice. Carvalho v. Estate of Carvalho, 186 Vt. 112, 978 A.2d 455 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        One challenging a will normally has the burden of demonstrating the existence of undue influence, but the burden of proof shifts to the proponent of the will when the circumstances connected with the execution of the will are such as the law regards with suspicion; thus, where suspicious circumstances are present, the will is presumed to be the product of undue influence, and it will not be enforced unless the proponent persuades the trier of fact that no undue influence attended the execution of the will. The court sees no reason not to apply the same principle in cases involving the execution or revocation of disclaimers of property interests, particularly in the context of the disclaimer of an inheritance. Carvalho v. Estate of Carvalho, 186 Vt. 112, 978 A.2d 455 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although a unilateral mistake of law may not normally be the basis for allowing revocation of a disclaimer, the disclaimant's misunderstanding of the legal effect of a disclaimer in the context of suspicious circumstances may be a critical factor for the fact finder to consider in determining whether there was duress, coercion, undue influence or some other equitable basis for allowing revocation. In other words, the disclaimant's misunderstanding of the legal effect of the disclaimer, when suspicious circumstances are present, may inform the fact finder's determination as to whether the disclaimant's sound judgment or true desire was overcome through coercive tactics. Carvalho v. Estate of Carvalho, 186 Vt. 112, 978 A.2d 455 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a mother disclaimed her interest in her son's estate in favor of her nephew, the facts established suspicious circumstances that imposed upon the nephew the burden of showing the absence of undue influence or coercion with respect to the mothers' signing of the disclaimer and precluded summary judgment for the nephew. The nephew, the executor for the son's estate, had advocated for the 92-year-old mother to sign a disclaimer, three weeks after the unexpected death of her son, that would effectively transfer the assets of the estate from the mother to himself as the estate's contingent beneficiary; furthermore, the mother signed the disclaimer, which had not been prepared beforehand, without understanding its consequences and without being given an earlier opportunity to review it herself or with another attorney. Carvalho v. Estate of Carvalho, 186 Vt. 112, 978 A.2d 455 (2009).

       <p>
        Disclaimer was plainly valid with regard to the specificity of the named property interest when a mother disclaimed "all right, title and interest" in her son's estate in the body of the disclaimer. This was sufficient for purposes of the statute regarding the form of a disclaimer, which did not require a list of particular assets to be disclaimed, but rather provided only that the disclaimer should "describe the property or interest disclaimed"; the fact that the disclaimer was drafted with a space where specific assets could be listed was of no consequence.

       <p>
        Plain meaning of the statutory language of the Uniform Disclaimer of Property Interests Act precludes revocation; the statute proscribing the effect of disclaimers states that a disclaimer "is binding upon the disclaimant and all persons claiming through or under him or her." Moreover, the legislature provided no method for revoking disclaimers, which is indicative of a legislative intent to preclude revocation. Carvalho v. Estate of Carvalho, 186 Vt. 112, 978 A.2d 455 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Disclaimant should be treated as if he or she had predeceased the decedent. The statutory language that "the property or interest devolved to a disclaimant under testamentary instrument or under the laws of intestacy ... devolves as if the disclaimant had predeceased the decedent" precludes the revival of the disclaimant's interest by revocation because the property interests of a deceased person are extinguished.

        Where a disclaimant has absolved himself of any interest that was properly his by will or intestate succession, the disclaimant is deemed to have predeceased the decedent. Like the predeceased who, by operation of death, is precluded from asserting a claim against a decedent's estate, the disclaimant may not rise some time later to assert his rights as beneficiary.

      <p>
       If the surety for a fiduciary considers himself or herself in danger of being injured thereby, a motion may be filed to order the fiduciary to settle the account and give a new bond. Upon notice and hearing, if it appears to the Probate Division of the Superior Court that the surety is in danger of being injured, it shall order the fiduciary to settle the account and give a new bond. When a new bond is filed and approved, the surety shall be discharged. If the fiduciary does not settle the accounts and give a new bond when so ordered, the court shall remove the fiduciary and fill the vacancy.

       Bonds given to the Probate Division of the Superior Court shall be prosecuted in the Superior Court of the county in which they were given for the benefit of those injured by the breach of their conditions, in the following manner:

      <ol>
       <li id="t14p04c101s2108ol11">
        A person claiming to be injured by a breach of the condition of a bond may file a motion for permission to prosecute the bond and shall give a bond to the adverse party to the satisfaction of the Probate Division of the Superior Court, on the condition that he or she will prosecute it to effect and pay the costs awarded if recovery is not obtained.
       </li>
       <li id="t14p04c101s2108ol12">
        The Probate Division of the Superior Court shall grant permission to prosecute the bond, and when the fees have been paid, shall furnish to the applicant a certified copy of the bond, with a certificate that leave to prosecute it has been granted, and the name and residence of the applicant.
       </li>
       <li id="t14p04c101s2108ol13">
        The applicant shall cause his or her name to be indorsed as prosecutor upon the writ and shall file the copy of the bond and the certificate furnished by the Probate Division of the Superior Court, with the writ, in the Superior Court to which and when it is returnable; and the applicant shall be deemed to be the prosecutor of the bond.
       </li>
       <li id="t14p04c101s2108ol14">
        The complaint on the bond shall definitely assign and set forth the breaches of the conditions on which the prosecutor relies.

        The Superior Court to which the writ is returned shall render judgment, as on default, for the penalty of the bond in favor of the Probate Division of the Superior Court and against the defendants, or those defendants who do not comply with the terms provided in subdivision (6) of this section, but costs shall not be taxed on the judgment.
       </li>
       <li id="t14p04c101s2108ol16">
        The defendants who wish to resist the judgment shall, on or before 21 days after service of the writ, plead a general denial, and, with their plea, file their affidavit, stating that they believe or are advised that they did not execute or deliver the bond; or they shall demur to the complaint.
       </li>
       <li id="t14p04c101s2108ol17">
        On trial, if the issue on the plea or demurrer is found in favor of the plaintiff, judgment shall be rendered for the penalty of the bond, as provided in subdivision (5) of this section, and the prosecutor shall recover against the defendants entering the plea or demurrer the costs of the action, and have execution for them in his or her own name.
       </li>
       <li id="t14p04c101s2108ol18">
        When judgment is rendered for the penalty of the bond against all the defendants, the judgment shall remain in force as security for other breaches of the conditions of the bond, which may be afterwards assigned and proved.

       <li id="t14p04c101s2108ol19">
        The action shall thereafter proceed and be prosecuted in the name of the prosecutor, on the breaches assigned. Upon prevailing, the prosecutor shall have judgment in his or her own name for damages and costs, but if judgment is rendered for the defendants on an issue joined in the action or on nonsuit, they shall recover double costs against the prosecutor.

        Plain language of the licensing statutes does not distinguish between guardians in voluntary or involuntary guardianships. Instead, the statutes refer generally to "guardians" or "fiduciaries," which include guardians. Citifinancial, Inc. v. Balch, 195 Vt. 21, 86 A.3d 415 (2013).

        Where, on the face of the record, it was beyond the power of claimed legal guardian to consent to and approve the granting of the license to mortgage on behalf of her minor devisees, the acceptance of the probate court of the application with such consent and approval as guardian was not to be taken in the nature of a decree or a valid license in that respect.

        When it was undisputed that the guardian in a voluntary guardianship failed to comply with the statute requiring probate court approval for the issuance of a mortgage deed, the mortgage deed was therefore ineffective. Citifinancial, Inc. v. Balch, 195 Vt. 21, 86 A.3d 415 (2013).

        Licensing statutes for guardianships do give the probate court the authority to restrict the terms of the underlying note as a condition of its approval of a mortgage; the court may withhold approval of a mortgage deed if the guardian fails to conform the underlying note to the court's requirements. But it does not follow that the statutes require probate court approval of a promissory note in its own right, rather than as a condition to the approval of a mortgage deed. Citifinancial, Inc. v.

        Words of this section were permissive in character, and enabled a trustee, contemplating a sale of personal property, to apply to the probate court and get a determination by that court that such sale was beneficial to the trust estate, that is, necessary or desirable.

        Fact that a trustee failed to get a license under this section to sell personal property in no way lessened his power to make such a sale, but merely left open question of whether power had been properly exercised. In re Wellman Estate, 119 Vt. 426, 127 A.2d 279 (1956).

       <p>
        By applying for a license under this section and obtaining a determination by probate court that a sale of trust assets was beneficial to trust, the trustee avoided possibility that its act in that regard would be later called in question by those interested in trust estate.

       § 2329. Testamentary additions to trusts; pour over trusts.
       <br/>
      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      A devise or bequest, the validity of which is determinable by the law of this State, may be made by a will to the trustee or trustees of a trust established or to be established by the testator or by the testator and some other person or persons or by some other person or persons, including a funded or unfunded life insurance trust, although the trustor has reserved any or all rights of ownership of the insurance contracts, if the trust is identified in the testator's will and its terms are set forth in a written instrument, other than a will, executed before or concurrently with the execution of the testator's will or in the valid last will of a person who has predeceased the testator, regardless of the existence, size, or character of the corpus of the trust. The devise or bequest shall not be invalid because the trust is amendable or revocable, or both, or because the trust was amended after the execution of the will or after the death of the testator. Unless the testator's will provides otherwise, the property so devised or bequeathed: (a) shall not be deemed to be held under a testamentary trust of the testator, but shall become a part of the trust to which it is given; and (b) shall be administered and disposed of in accordance with the provisions of the instrument or a will of a person other than the testator setting forth the terms of the trust, including any amendments thereto made before the death of the testator, regardless of whether made before or after the execution of the testator's will, and, if the testator's will so provides, including any amendments to the trust made after the death of the testator. A revocation or termination of the trust before the death of the testator shall cause the devise or bequest to lapse. However, when the testator's will specifically sets forth the terms of the trust, whether or not the trust is subsequently amended, revoked, or terminated, the property devised or bequeathed under the will shall be deemed to be held under a testamentary trust of the testator and shall be administered and disposed of in accordance with the provision of the testator's will.

      This article shall be construed in accordance with the following purposes and policies:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t14p04c111sub02s2621ol11">
       It is presumed that the interests of minor children are best promoted in the child's own home. However, when parents are temporarily unable to care for their children, guardianship provides a process through which parents can arrange for family members or other parties to care for the children.
      </li>
      <li id="t14p04c111sub02s2621ol12">
       Family members can make better decisions about minor children when they understand the consequences of those decisions and are informed about the law and the available supports.
      </li>
      <li id="t14p04c111sub02s2621ol13">
       Decisions about raising a child made by a person other than the child's parent should be based on the informed consent of the parties unless there has been a finding of parental unsuitability.
      </li>
      <li id="t14p04c111sub02s2621ol14">
       When the informed consent of the parents cannot be obtained, parents have a fundamental liberty interest in raising their children unless a proposed guardian can show parental unsuitability by clear and convincing evidence.
      </li>
      <li id="t14p04c111sub02s2621ol15">
       Research demonstrates that timely reunification between parents and their children is more likely when children have safe and substantial contact with their parents.
      </li>
      <li id="t14p04c111sub02s2621ol16">
       It is in the interests of all parties, including the children, that parents and proposed guardians have a shared understanding about the length of time that they expect the guardianship to last, the circumstances under which the parents will resume care for their children, and the nature of the supports and services that are available to assist them.

        Trial court did not err in its treatment of voluntary guardianship petitions filed during the pendency of the juvenile proceedings and transferred to it, as it provided a reasoned basis for its decision to consider the termination of parental rights (TPR) petitions before the guardianship petitions in that it explained that after the filing of the TPRs it made little sense for the guardianship petitioners to continue to attend hearings at which they had no role, and also expressed concern about petitioners' continued presence at the hearings when they would be testifying as witnesses in the upcoming TPR. Furthermore, the children's parents lacked standing to make claims on behalf of the guardianship petitioners. In re A.M. & G.M., - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (Oct. 16, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a guardianship proceeding by the child's paternal grandmother was transferred from the probate division to the family division due to a pending custody proceeding, the family division properly transferred the guardianship matter back to the probate division to proceed after the termination of parental rights petition was resolved, as this option was statutorily available. Furthermore, the record demonstrated that the family division understood there was discretion under the statute regarding the choices for proceeding and exercised that discretion appropriately. In re C.B., - Vt.
    - , - A.3d - (Sept. 25, 2020).
       </p>
       <p>
        In dismissing appellants' petition for appointment of a guardian on the ground that the Family Division had exclusive jurisdiction over the child, the Probate Division failed to comply with the statute regarding transfer of a guardianship proceeding to the Family Division, including the requirement that the Probate judge confer with the Superior judge assigned to the Family Division regarding jurisdiction over the proceeding. In re Guardianship of N.P., 204 Vt. 272, 166 A.3d 593 (2017).

         1. Purpose.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        This section was intended by the legislature to permit the settlement of small claims belonging to minor children without the formality and expense attendant upon the appointment of a guardian for the child. Whitcomb v. Dancer, 140 Vt. 580, 443 A.2d 458 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even in the case of relatively small claims, the legislature intended not to totally remove the protections traditionally afforded by the guardianship procedure in enacting this section. Whitcomb v. Dancer, 140 Vt. 580, 443 A.2d 458 (1982).

         1.5. Construction.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        There is nothing in the statute governing releases on behalf of a minor, as construed in Whitcomb, that provides authority for a superior court to supervise the use and investment of a minor's settlement proceeds once the settlement is approved. Thus, the statute did not authorize a superior court to control how the proceeds from a wrongful death suit were used or invested after distribution. In re Willey, 189 Vt. 536, 14 A.3d 954 (mem.) (2010).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where parties to wrongful death action reached a settlement which provided benefits for deceased's minor child, court did not have authority under this section, to reject the settlement and compel the parties to go to trial, since the wrongful death claim belonged to deceased's estate and there was no cause of action of a minor subject to release, a prerequisite for operation of this section. Estate of Tilton v. Lamoille Superior Court, 148 Vt. 213, 531 A.2d 919 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section establishes the authority of a parent to release the claims of a minor, and that authority is not contained in section 2657 of this title, governing appointment of a guardian ad litem for a minor. Whitcomb v. Dancer, 140 Vt. 580, 443 A.2d 458 (1982).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        This section imposes an affirmative obligation on a superior court judge to protect the best interests of the minor through an independent inquiry to determine whether the proposed settlement and parental release does in fact satisfy this standard. Whitcomb v. Dancer, 140 Vt. 580, 443 A.2d 458 (1982).

         4. Amount of claim.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        This section requires approval of a settlement by the superior court judge in cases involving settlements in excess of $500 as well as in cases involving settlements of $500 or less as there is no legitimate rationale for protecting minor children in settlement agreements of $500 or less, yet denying protection merely because the settlement is in excess of $500, since in both situations the minor child is in need of protection from the potential improvidence of his or her parents. Whitcomb v. Dancer, 140 Vt. 580, 443 A.2d 458 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Purpose of legislature in enacting this section was to modify the common law only with respect to settlements of $500 or less, and where proposed settlement agreement exceeded $500 it was necessary for the minor to be represented by a court-appointed guardian. Whitcomb v. Dancer, 140 Vt. 580, 443 A.2d 458 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Language of this section prior to 1979 amendment would not be construed as not requiring judicial involvement in cases where a parent settled a minor child's claim for more than $500, since even a guardian ad litem cannot, at common law, settle the claim of a minor without judicial supervision, and a parent, acting as next friend or parent of a minor child, would have no greater authority to settle the claims of the child than would a guardian ad litem, and, therefore, such a construction would effectuate a substantial change in the common law. Whitcomb v. Dancer, 140 Vt. 580, 443 A.2d 458 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in granting summary judgment for defendant in negligence case based on accord and satisfaction of minor's cause of action as result of settlement agreement entered into between the parent of the minor child and the defendant, since the settlement was invalid under this section, the effect of which was only to modify the common law prohibition of a parent compromising a minor child's cause of action absent statutory authority with respect to settlements of $500 or less, and under which, where the proposed settlement exceeded $500, it was necessary for the minor to be represented by a court-appointed guardian. Whitcomb v. Dancer, 140 Vt. 580, 443 A.2d 458 (1982).
       </p>
       <p>
        Allocation of a specific settlement sum to a minor child where defendants seek to contract with parents in settlement of litigation involving a minor child in which the suit is brought by the parents on behalf of the minor plaintiff and in which the parents also join as party plaintiff is necessary because it enables the superior court judge to properly perform the supervisory role required by subsection (a) of this section, authorizing settlement of claims on behalf of minor child by superior court and parent in all cases where the proposed settlement is $1,500 or less, and is also necessary so that the parties and the court will know when the appointment of a guardian for a minor child is mandated by subsection (b) of this section. Whitcomb v. Dancer, 140 Vt. 580, 443 A.2d 458 (1982).

         1. Constitutionality.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Subdivision (2) of this section, providing for appointment of a guardian for a minor when parent is shown to be unsuitable to have the minor's custody, is not so vague, in using the "suitability" standard, as to violate due process, in view of the saving interpretation given to suitability by supreme court. Rutherford v. Best, 139 Vt. 56, 421 A.2d 1303 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although subdivision (3) of this section, authorizing appointment of guardian for minors under certain circumstances, did not specifically provide for notice to parents of minor, it did not follow that it was wanting in due process of law, for, there being no express requirement to contrary, statute will not be interpreted to authorize judicial proceedings without notice to parties to be affected thereby. Bioni v. Haselton, 99 Vt. 453, 134 A. 606 (1926).

         2. Notice and hearing.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Appointment of guardian of minor domiciled in state, under subdivision (3) of this section without notice of proceedings to minor's parents who resided out of state, was void. Bioni v. Haselton, 99 Vt. 453, 134 A. 606 (1926).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a minor has no parent living who is authorized to act as his guardian, on application of such minor or of any relative or friend, probate court may appoint some suitable person, and under this provision of statute, whenever appointment of a guardian is made by probate court, notice is not required to be given to anyone. Farrar v. Olmstead, 24 Vt. 123 (1852).

       <p>
        Subdivision (2) of this section does not impose a requirement that the probate court appoint a guardian ad litem for an incompetent parent in a proceeding for appointment of a guardian for the minor child of such parent. Guardianship of H.L., 143 Vt. 62, 460 A.2d 478 (1983).

         4. Child born out of wedlock.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        There is no per se statutory preference in favor of the natural father of a child born out of wedlock, and this section does not impose on third parties seeking custody of a child born out of wedlock the initial burden of proving the father to be incompetent or unsuitable. In re S.B.L., 150 Vt. 294, 553 A.2d 1078 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        If the father of a child born out of wedlock demonstrates the requisite custodial, personal or financial relationship with the child, he acquires the status of joint guardian with the mother, section 2644 of this title notwithstanding, and a third party guardian may not be appointed for the child under this section without proof of the requisite grounds listed in this section.

         5. Nonresident.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Probate court had authority under section 2711 of this title to appoint a guardian for a nonresident minor who was injured in an automobile accident in this state, since, if she were a resident, she would qualify under subsection (5) for the appointment of a guardian over her property, which consisted of the pending lawsuit. Matson by Kehoe v. Anctil, 979 F. Supp. 1031 (D. Vt. 1997).

         6. Termination.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Although there is no specific statute on termination of a guardianship created under subdivision (4) of this section, having provided for a hearing on the merits of revocation when the parent has been found "incompetent or unsuitable" under subdivision (2), it is reasonable to assume that the Legislature intended a similar hearing when custody was transferred in the "best interest of the minor" under subdivision (4); in either case, revocation would be contingent upon a finding, after hearing, that the circumstances which precipitated the transfer of custody no longer pertained. Boisvert v. Harrington, 173 Vt. 285, 796 A.2d 1102 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the right to care for one's children is a fundamental liberty interest, recognized and protected by the Vermont Supreme Court and the United States Supreme Court, a parent who seeks to revoke guardianship created under subdivision (4) of this section enjoys a presumption that his or her custody is in the child's best interest; however, nothing in the constitutional or statutory scheme, the common law, or general practice supports the proposition that the guardianship is terminable at the will of the parent. Boisvert v. Harrington, 173 Vt. 285, 796 A.2d 1102 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where current guardians and the minor's court-appointed attorney oppose revocation of guardianship created under subdivision (4) of this section, the court must be free to order an evidentiary hearing to determine whether granting the petition is in the best interests of the child. Boisvert v. Harrington, 173 Vt. 285, 796 A.2d 1102 (2002).

     </h3>
     <p>
      By a last will, either parent may appoint guardians for minor children, or for children, regardless of age, who are judicially determined to be in need of guardianship under the provisions of this chapter, whether living at the time of making the will or born afterwards, and such guardians shall be governed by the laws applicable to guardians appointed by the Probate Division of the Superior Court.
    If, by his or her will appointing a guardian, the testator orders or requests that a bond shall not be required, it may be dispensed with, unless the Probate Division of the Superior Court judges that from a change in the circumstances of the guardian or from other cause the estate of the ward will be insecure.

       Where the permanent guardianship is terminated by the Probate Division of the Superior Court order or the death of the permanent guardian, the custody and guardianship of the child shall not revert to the parent, but to the Commissioner for Children and Families as if the child had been abandoned. If a successor permanent guardian has been named in the initial permanent guardianship order, custody shall transfer to the successor guardian, without reverting first to the Commissioner. The Probate Division of the Superior Court shall notify the Department when custody transfers to the Commissioner or the successor guardian. At any time during the first six months of the successor guardianship, the Probate Division may, upon its own motion and independent of its regular review process, hold a hearing to determine, by a preponderance of the evidence, whether the successor permanent guardian continues to meet the requirements under subdivision 2664(a)(4) of this title.

        Appointment by probate court of a guardian for person whom it adjudges incapable of caring for himself and his property was a nullity where it did not affirmatively appear that the six days' notice of application for appointment was given. Mason's Guardian v. Mason, 86 Vt. 279, 84 A. 969 (1912).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a guardian is appointed to an idiot, non compos, lunatic or distracted person without any notice being given to such person by authority making the inquisition, or by court of probate, the appointment is void. Shumway v. Shumway, 2 Vt. 339 (1829).
       </p>
       <p>
        Appointment, though voidable for want of notice, was not void and guardian might well act under such appointment until his letters were repealed, and had a right to account before the probate court. Cleveland v. Hopkins, 2 Aik. 394 (1827).

      When minor children inherit real or personal estate as the representatives of a deceased parent, or take the same by will, and the living parent of the children as guardian has the custody of their persons and estates, if the Probate Division of the Superior Court directs, the guardian shall furnish a bond to respond and pay the principal of the estate only.
    The income of the estate shall be expended at the discretion of the guardian for the benefit of the children without account to the court.
    When a person other than a parent of the children is their guardian and has the custody of their estates only, the court, from time to time, may order and direct the guardian to pay over to the parent of the children the part of the income of their estates, to be expended for their benefit as to the court seems just, in view of the relative value of the estate of the parent and the children.

     </h3>
     <p>
      A ward, the heir apparent of a ward, or a person interested in the welfare of a ward, as defined in section 3061 of this title, may file a motion with the Probate Division of the Superior Court to require the guardian to give a new and sufficient bond.
    If it appears to the court that the bond is insufficient, the court may order the guardian to give a new and sufficient bond.
    When it appears on the motion of a surety in a guardian's bond that the surety is liable to be injured thereby, the court may discharge the surety from future responsibility and order the guardian to give a new bond.
    After being notified of the order, if the guardian does not give a new bond, the court may remove the guardian and appoint some other person.

     <p>
      When a ward is joint tenant or tenant in common with others, the ward's guardian may agree with the other joint tenants or tenants in common, to make partition of the lands so held. When that agreement is made in writing and filed with the Probate Division of the Superior Court, the Probate Division of the Superior Court may make the partition.
    A certified copy thereof shall be recorded in the office where by law a deed of those lands is required to be recorded, and the partition shall be binding on the ward, the ward's heirs and assigns and on the parties to the agreement.

      </b>
     </h3>
     <p>
      As provided in section 2881 of this title, the order of a Probate Division of the Superior Court licensing the sale of lands of wards shall be made under the following regulations:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t14p04c111sub06s2882ol11">
       On motion of the guardian for license to sell, the probate division of the superior court shall schedule a hearing and notice shall be given as provided by the Rules of Probate Procedure.
      </li>
      <li id="t14p04c111sub06s2882ol12">
       At the hearing, the guardian shall produce evidence of the value of the estate to be sold, the interest of the ward therein and of the necessity of sale.
      </li>
      <li id="t14p04c111sub06s2882ol13">
       Before license is granted and if the court requires, the guardian shall give a bond with sufficient sureties, in a sum double the value of the land to be sold, conditioned to account for the proceeds of the sale, according to law, and shall also be sworn to sell the estate as judged will be most beneficial to the ward.
    A certificate of the oath made by the authority administering it shall be returned to the Probate Division of the Superior Court before the license issues.
      </li>
      <li id="t14p04c111sub06s2882ol14">
       If the foregoing requisites are complied with, the court may order a public or private sale of the lands of the ward or an interest in the same, or such part thereof as the court deems necessary, and shall furnish the guardian with a certified copy of its order.
      </li>
      <li id="t14p04c111sub06s2882ol15">
       If the court directs a public sale, the order shall designate the mode of giving notice of the time and place thereof, and the sale shall be in the town where the lands lie.
      </li>
      <li id="t14p04c111sub06s2882ol16">
       The order of sale shall state that the requisites mentioned in subdivisions (1)-(3) of this section have been complied with. A copy thereof shall be recorded, previous to the sale, in the office where a deed of such lands is required to be recorded.

    The petition shall set forth that the removal of the property of the ward will not conflict with the terms and limitations of the right by which the ward owns the same nor be prejudicial to the ward's interests therein.
    The petition shall be accompanied by a complete transcript from the records of a court of competent jurisdiction of the state in which the guardian and ward reside, duly exemplified or authenticated, showing appointment as guardian of the ward and that, by bond or otherwise, satisfactory security has been given for the faithful execution of the trust.

      Guardianship shall be utilized only as necessary to promote the well-being of the individual and to protect the individual from violations of his or her human and civil rights. It shall be designed to encourage the development and maintenance of maximum self-reliance and independence in the individual and only the least restrictive form of guardianship shall be ordered to the extent required by the individual's actual mental and adaptive limitations. The State of Vermont recognizes the fundamental right of an adult with capacity to determine the extent of health care the individual will receive.

        Use of the word "notwithstanding" demonstrates that the Legislature conferred upon the Probate Division an additional power to restrict access to involuntary guardianship evaluations, or portions thereof, above and beyond the confidentiality and access restrictions previously enumerated in that subsection. Accordingly, the Probate Division has jurisdiction under appropriate circumstances to make an order restricting access to an evaluation. In re Guardianship of A.S., 192 Vt. 631 (mem.), 57 A.3d 716 (2012).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Fact that the order requesting an involuntary guardianship evaluation may have been a mistake does not negate the evaluation's status as an evaluation under the involuntary guardianship statute. Thus, the probate court's authority with respect to the disposition of that report is governed by the statute in particular, as well as the probate court's general powers. In re Guardianship of A.S., 192 Vt. 631 (mem.), 57 A.3d 716 (2012).

        Although the probate court had the authority to seal an initial evaluation in a guardianship proceeding, it erred in sealing the evaluation here. It did not act out of concern for the privacy of the ward or other confidentiality interests; rather, its concern was that the entity which performed the evaluation might have a legal obligation to take further action with respect to the ward than it would not otherwise have had if the evaluation had been limited to what was permitted under another statute.

       <p>
        Like the majority of jurisdictions around the country, Vermont continues to conclude that the right to end a marriage through divorce is volitional and personal such that the Legislature did not intend, through a general grant of authority, to permit it to be carried out by a guardian. If the Vermont Supreme Court were to imply this power, it would encroach on an area that the Legislature has seen fit to address by statute, and without any airing of the multiple issues of public policy that might be relevant to the question. Samis v. Samis, 189 Vt. 434, 22 A.3d 444 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Without specific authority in the statute granting a guardian the power to obtain legal advice and to commence court actions in the name of the person under guardianship, a guardian was without power to file a divorce on a wife's behalf, and the husband's motion to dismiss should have been granted. Samis v. Samis, 189 Vt. 434, 22 A.3d 444 (2011).

         2. Approval of contract.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        When a guardian signed a promissory note on a line bearing the pre-printed designation "Borrower," with no reference to her status as the ward's guardian, a factfinder could easily infer that the guardian's signature reflected her assent to the loan. The question of the "capacity" in which she signed the document might very well be critical to an assessment of the ward's own personal liability on the note, but was not determinative of the question of whether she approved his entering into the contract. Citifinancial, Inc. v. Balch, 195 Vt. 21, 86 A.3d 415 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont Code requires a guardian's approval of a ward's execution of a contract; it does not prescribe any particular requirements for documenting that approval, and does not require the guardian to cosign agreements executed by the ward with her approval, let alone to cosign in a particular "capacity." The statute simply requires the guardian's approval. Citifinancial, Inc. v. Balch, 195 Vt. 21, 86 A.3d 415 (2013).

       When a petition for guardianship has been filed, but adherence to the procedures set out in this subchapter would cause serious and irreparable harm to the respondent's physical health or financial interests, the Probate Division of the Superior Court may appoint an emergency temporary guardian prior to the final hearing and decision on the petition, subject to the requirements of this section.
      </li>
      <li id="t14p04c111sub12s3081ol1b">
       If a guardianship petition is accompanied by a motion for emergency temporary guardianship, the court shall schedule a hearing on the appointment of an emergency temporary guardian for the earliest possible date. The court shall appoint counsel for the respondent and cause notice to be given as provided by the Vermont Rules of Probate Procedure (VRPP). Upon a showing by sworn affidavit that notice cannot be given within the time periods, in the manner, or to the persons required by the VRPP, the court may allow a hearing to go forward upon such notice as the court may direct. The court may appoint an emergency temporary guardian if it finds that serious and irreparable harm to the respondent's physical health or financial interests will likely result during the pendency of the petition.
      </li>
      <li id="t14p04c111sub12s3081ol1c">
       An emergency temporary guardian may be appointed without notice to the respondent or respondent's counsel only if it clearly appears from specific facts shown by affidavit or sworn testimony that immediate, serious, and irreparable harm will result to the respondent before the hearing on the appointment of an emergency temporary guardian can be held. A request for ex parte emergency temporary guardianship under this section shall be made by written motion, accompanied by a petition for guardianship, unless waived by the court for good cause shown. If the court appoints an ex parte emergency temporary guardian, the court shall immediately schedule a temporary hearing in accordance with subsection (b) of this section. The ex parte order shall state why the order was granted without notice and include findings on the immediate, serious, and irreparable harm. The ex parte order shall be for a fixed period of time, not to exceed 14 days, and shall expire on its terms unless extended after the temporary hearing. If the temporary hearing cannot be held before the ex parte order expires, the ex parte order can be extended for good cause shown for an additional 14 days until the temporary hearing is held.

       A temporary guardianship order expires when the court renders a final decision on the guardianship petition.

       Whenever, in a proceeding under the laws of this State for the commitment of a person alleged to be of unsound mind or otherwise in need of confinement in a hospital or other institution for his proper care, it is determined after such adjudication of the status of such person as may be required by law that commitment to a hospital for mental disease or other institution is necessary for safekeeping or treatment and it appears that such person is eligible for care or treatment by the Veterans' Administration or other agency of the U.S. government, the court, upon receipt of a certificate from the Veterans' Administration or such other agency showing that facilities are available and that such person is eligible for care or treatment there, may commit such person to such Veterans' Administration or other agency. The person whose commitment is sought shall be personally served with notice of the pending commitment proceeding in the manner as provided by the law of this State; and nothing in this chapter shall affect his right to appear and be heard in the proceedings. Upon commitment, when admitted to a facility operated by such agency within or without this State, such person shall be subject to the rules and regulations of the Veterans' Administration or other agency.

    Consent is hereby given to the application of the law of the committing state or district in respect to the authority of the chief officer of a facility of the Veterans' Administration, or of an institution operated in this State by another agency of the United States to retain custody, or transfer, parole, or discharge the committed person.

    Upon effecting such transfer, the committing court or proper officer thereof shall be notified thereof by the transferring agency.

      Prefatory Note
     </b>
    </p>
    <p>
     This Act revises and restates the Uniform Gifts to Minors Act (UGMA) some version of which has been enacted in every American jurisdiction.
    </p>
    <p>
     The original version of UGMA was adopted by the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws in 1956 and closely followed a model 'Act concerning Gifts of Securities to Minors' which was sponsored by the New York Stock Exchange and the Association of Stock Exchange Firms and which had been adopted in 14 states.
    The 1956 version of UGMA broadened the model act to cover gifts of money as well as securities but made few other changes.
    </p>
    <p>
     In 1965 and 1966 the Conference revised UGMA to expand the types of financial institutions which could serve as depositories of custodial funds, to facilitate the designation of successor custodians, and to add life insurance policies and annuity contracts to the types of property (cash and securities) that could be made the subject of a gift under the Act.
    </p>
    <p>
     Not all states adopted the 1966 revisions; some 11 jurisdictions retained their versions of the 1956 Act.
    More importantly, however, many states since 1966 have substantially revised their versions of UGMA to expand the kinds of property that may be made the subject of a gift under the Act, and a few states permit transfers to custodians from other sources, such as trusts and estates, as well as lifetime gifts.
    As a result, a great deal of non-uniformity has arisen among the states.
    Uniformity in this area is important, for the Conference has cited UGMA as an example of an act designed to avoid conflicts of law when the laws of more than one state may apply to a transaction or a series of transactions.
    </p>
    <p>
     This Act follows the expansive approach taken by several states and allows any kind of property, real or personal, tangible or intangible, to be made the subject of a transfer to a custodian for the benefit of a minor (section 3211(4) of this chapter).
    In addition, it permits such transfers not only by lifetime outright gifts (section 3214), but also from trusts, estates and guardianships, whether or not specifically authorized in the governing instrument (sections 3215 and 3216), and from other third parties indebted to a minor who does not have a conservator, such as parties against whom a minor has a tort claim or judgment, and depository institutions holding deposits or insurance companies issuing policies payable on death to a minor (section 3217).
    For this reason, and to distinguish the enactment of this statute from the 1956 and 1966 versions of UGMA, the title of the Act has been changed to refer to "Transfers" rather than to "Gifts," a much narrower term.
    </p>
    <p>
     As so expanded, the Act might be considered a statutory form of trust or guardianship that continues until the minor reaches 21.
    Note, however, that unlike a trust, a custodianship is not a separate legal entity or taxpayer. Under section 3221(b) of this chapter, the custodial property is indefeasibly vested in the minor, not the custodian, and thus any income received is attributable to and reportable by the minor, whether or not actually distributed to the minor.
    </p>
    <p>
     The expansion of the Act to permit transfers of any kind of property to a custodian creates a significant problem of potential personal liability for the minor or the custodian arising from the ownership of property such as real estate, automobiles, general partnership interests, and business proprietorships.
    This problem did not exist under UGMA under which custodial property was limited to bank deposits, securities and insurance.
    In response, section 3227 of this Act generally limits the claims of third parties to recourse against the custodial property, with the minor insulated against personal liability unless he is personally at fault. The custodian is similarly insulated unless he is personally at fault or fails to disclose his custodial capacity in entering into a contract.
    </p>
    <p>
     Nevertheless, the Act should be used with caution with respect to property such as real estate or general partnership interests from which liabilities as well as benefits may arise.
    Many of the possible risks can and should be insured against, and the custodian has the power under section 3223(a) of this chapter to purchase such insurance, at least when other custodial assets are sufficient to do so.
    If the assets are not sufficient, there is doubt that a custodian will act, or there are significant uninsurable risks, a transferor should consider a trust with spendthrift provisions, such as a minority trust under Section 2503(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, rather than a custodianship, to make a gift of such property to a minor.
    </p>
    <p>
     The Act retains (or reverts to) 21 as the age of majority or, more accurately, the age at which the custodianship terminates and the property is distributed.
    Since tax law permits duration of Section 2503(c) trusts to 21, even though the statutory age of majority is 18 in most states, this age should be retained since most donors and other transferors wish to preserve a custodianship as long as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
     Finally, the Act restates and rearranges, rather than amends, the 1966 Act.
    The addition of other forms of property and other forms of dispositions made adherence to the format and language of the prior act very unwieldy.
    In addition, the 1966 and 1956 Acts closely followed the language of the earlier model act, which had already been adopted in several states, even though it did not conform to Conference style. It is hoped that this rewriting and revision of UGMA will improve its clarity while also expanding its coverage.

       OFFICIAL COMMENT
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      To reflect the broader scope and the unlimited types of property to which the new Act will apply, a number of definitional changes have been made from the 1966 Act.
    In addition, several definitions specifically applicable to the limited types of property (cash, securities and insurance policies) subject to the 1966 Act have been eliminated as unnecessary.
    These include the definitions of "bank," "issuer," "life insurance policy or annuity contract," "security," and "transfer agent."
    No change in the meaning or construction of these terms as used in this Act is intended by such deletions.
     </p>
     <p>
      The definitions of "domestic financial institution" and 'insured financial institution' have been eliminated because few if any states limit deposits by custodians to local institutions, and the prudent person rule of section 3222(b) of this chapter may dictate the use of insured institutions as depositories, without having the Act so specify.
     </p>
     <p>
      The principal changes or additions to the remaining definitions are discussed below.
     </p>
     <p>
      Paragraph (2).
    The definition of "benefit plan" is intentionally very broad and is meant to cover any contract, plan, system, account or trust such as a pension plan, retirement plan, death benefit plan, deferred compensation plan, employment agency arrangement or, stock bonus, option or profit sharing plan.
     </p>
     <p>
      Paragraph (4).
    The definition of "custodial property" has been generalized and expanded to encompass every conceivable legal or equitable interest in property of any kind, including real estate and tangible or intangible personal property.
    The term is intended, for example, to include joint interests with right of survivorship, beneficial interests in land trusts, as well as all other intangible interests in property. Contingent or expectancy interests such as the designation as a beneficiary under insurance policies or benefit plans become "custodial property" only if the designation is irrevocable, or when it becomes so, but the Act specifically authorizes the "nomination" of a future custodian as beneficiary of such interests (see section 3213 of this chapter).
    Proceeds of custodial property, both immediate and remote, are themselves custodial property, as is the case under UGMA.
     </p>
     <p>
      Custodial property is defined without reference to the physical location of the property, even if it has one.
    No useful purpose would be served by restricting the application of the Act to, for example, real estate "located in this state," since a conveyance recorded in the state of the property's location, if done with proper formalities, should be effective even if that state has not enacted this Act.
    The rights, duties and powers of the custodian should be determined by reference to the law of the state under which the custodianship is created, assuming there is sufficient nexus under section 3212 of this chapter between that state and the transferor, the minor or the custodian.
     </p>
     <p>
      Paragraph (10).
    This definition of "minor" retains the historical age of 21 as the age of majority, even though most states have lowered the age for most other purposes, as well as in their versions of the 1966 Act.
    Nevertheless, because the Internal Revenue Code continues to permit 'minority trusts' under Section 2503(c) of the Internal Revenue Code, to continue in effect until age 21, and because it is believed that most donors creating minority trusts or custodianships prefer to retain the property under management for the benefit of the young person as long as possible, it is strongly suggested that the age of 21 be retained as the age of majority under this Act.
     </p>
     <p>
      Paragraph (12).
    The definition of the term "personal representative" is based upon that definition in Sec. 1-201(30) of the Uniform Probate Code.
     </p>
     <p>
      Paragraph (14).
    The new definition of "transfer" is necessary to reflect the application of the Act not only to gifts, but also to distributions from trusts and estates, obligors of the minor, and transfers of the minor's own assets to a custodianship by the legal representative of a minor, all of which are now permitted by this Act.
     </p>
     <p>
      Paragraph (15).
    The new definition of "transferor" is required because the term includes not only the maker of a gift, i.e., a donor in the usual sense, but also fiduciaries and obligors who control or own property that is the subject of the transfer.
    Nothing in this Act requires that a transferor be an "adult."
    If permitted under other law of the enacting state relating to emancipation or competence to make a will, gift, or other transfer, a minor may make an effective transfer of property to a custodian for his benefit or for the benefit of another minor.
     </p>
     <p>
      Paragraph (16).
    Only entities authorized to exercise "general" trust powers qualify as "trust companies"; that is, the authority to exercise only limited fiduciary responsibilities, such as the authority to accept Individual Retirement Account deposits, is not sufficient.

       OFFICIAL COMMENT
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      This section has no counterpart in the 1966 Act.
    It attempts to resolve uncertainties and conflicts-of-laws questions that have frequently arisen because of the present non-uniformity of UGMA in the various states and which may continue to arise during the transition from UGMA to this Act.
     </p>
     <p>
      The creation of a custodianship must invoke the law of a particular state because of the form of the transfer required under section 3219(a) of this chapter. This section provides that a choice of the UTMA of the enacting state is appropriate and effective if any of the nexus factors specified in subsection (a) exists at the time of the transfer.
    This Act continues to govern, and subsection (b) makes the custodian accountable and subject to personal jurisdiction in the courts of the enacting state for the duration of the custodianship, despite subsequent relocation of the parties or the property.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (c) recognizes that residents of the enacting state may elect to have the law of another state apply to a transfer.
    That choice is valid if a nexus with the chosen state exists at the time of the transfer.
    If personal jurisdiction can be obtained in the enacting state under other law apart from this Act, the custodianship may be enforced in its courts, which are directed to apply the law of the state elected by the transferor.
     </p>
     <p>
      If the choice of law under subsection (a) or (c) is ineffective because of the absence of the required nexus, the transfer may still be effective under the Act of another state with which a nexus does exist.
    See section 3231 of this chapter.

     <p>
      This section is new and permits a future custodian for a minor to be nominated to receive a distribution under a will or trust, or as a beneficiary of a power of appointment, or of contractual rights such as a life or endowment insurance policy, annuity contract, P.O.D. Account, benefit plan, or similar future payment right.
    Nomination of a future custodian does not constitute a "transfer" under this Act and does not create custodial property.
    If it did, the nomination and beneficiary designation would have to be permanent, since a "transfee" is irrevocable and indefeasibly vests ownership of the interest in the minor under section 3221(b) of this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Instead, this section permits a revocable beneficiary designation that takes effect only when the donor dies, or when a lifetime transfer to the custodian for the minor beneficiary occurs, such as a distribution under an inter vivos trust.
    However, an unrevoked nomination under this section is binding on a personal representative or trustee (see section 3215(b) of this chapter) and on insurance companies and other obligors who contract to pay in the future (see section 3217(b)).
     </p>
     <p>
      The person making the nomination may name contingent or successive future custodians to serve, in the order named, in the event that the person first nominated dies, or is unable, declines, or is ineligible to serve.
    Such a substitute future custodian is a custodian "nominated . . . under Section 3213" to whom the transfer must be made under sections 3215(b) and 3217(b) of this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Any person nominated as future custodian may decline to serve before the transfer occurs and may resign at any time after the transfer.

      To emphasize the different kinds of transfers that create presently effective custodianships under this Act, they are separately described in sections 3214, 3215, 3216 and 3217 of this chapter.
    This section in part corresponds to Section 2(a) of the 1966 Act and covers the traditional lifetime gift that was the only kind of transfer authorized by the 1966 Act.
    It also covers an irrevocable exercise of a power of appointment in favor of a custodian, as distinguished from the exercise of a power in a revocable instrument that results only in the nomination of a future custodian under section 3213.

      This section is new and has no counterpart in the 1966 Act. It is based on nonuniform provisions adopted by Connecticut, Illinois, Wisconsin and other states to validate distributions from trusts and estates to a custodian for a minor beneficiary, when the use of a custodian is expressly authorized by the governing instrument.
    It also covers the designation of the custodian whenever the settlor or testator fails to make a nomination, or the future custodian nominated under section 3213 of this chapter (and any alternate named) fails to qualify.

     </p>
     <p>
      This section is new and has no counterpart in the 1966 Act. It covers a new concept, already authorized by the law of some states through nonuniform amendments to the 1966 Act, to permit custodianships to be used as guardianship or conservator substitutes, even though not specifically authorized by the person whose property is the subject of the transfer.
    It also permits the legal representative of the minor, such as a conservator or guardian, to transfer the minor's own property to a new or existing custodianship for the purposes of convenience or economies of administration.
     </p>
     <p>
      A custodianship may be created under this section even though not specifically authorized by the transferor, the testator, or the settlor of the trust if three tests are satisfied. First, the fiduciary making the transfer must determine in good faith and in his fiduciary capacity that a custodianship will be in the best interests of the minor.
    Second, a custodianship may not be prohibited by, or inconsistent with, the terms of any governing instrument.
    Inconsistent terms would include, for example, a spendthrift clause in a governing trust, provisions terminating a governing trust for the minor's benefit at a time other than the time of the minor's age of majority, and provisions for mandatory distributions of income or principal at specific times or periodic intervals.
    Provisions for other outright distributions or bequests would not be inconsistent with the creation of a custodianship under this section.
    Third, the amount of property transferred (as measured by its value) must be of such relatively small amount that the lack of court supervision and the typically stricter investment standards that would apply to the conservator otherwise required will not be important.
    However, if the property is of significant size, transfer to a custodian may still be made if the court approves and if the other two tests are met.
     </p>
     <p>
      The custodianship created under this section without express authority in the governing instrument will terminate upon the minor's attainment of the statutory age of majority of the enacting state apart from this Act, i.e., at the same age a conservatorship of the minor would end. See section 3220 of this chapter and the accompanying Comment.

      This section is new and, like section 3216 of this chapter, permits a custodianship to be established as a substitute for a conservator to receive payments due a minor from sources other than estates, trusts, and existing guardianships covered by sections 3215 and 3216.
    For example, a tort judgment debtor of a minor, a bank holding a joint or P.O.D. account of which a minor is the surviving payee, or an insurance company holding life insurance policy or benefit plan proceeds payable to a minor may create a custodianship under this section.
     </p>
     <p>
      Use of this section is mandatory when a future custodian has been nominated under section 3213 of this chapter as a named beneficiary of an insurance policy, benefit plan, deposit account, or the like, because the original owner of the property specified a custodianship (and a future custodian) to receive the property.
    If that custodian (or any alternate named) is not available, if none was nominated, or none could have been nominated (as in the case of a tort judgment payable to the minor), this section is permissive and does not preclude the obligor from requiring the appointment of a conservator to receive payment.
    It allows the obligor to transfer to a custodian unless the property exceeds the stated value, in which case a conservator must be appointed to receive it.

      This section discharges transferors from further responsibility for custodial property delivered to and receipted for by the custodian.
    See also section 3226 of this chapter which protects transferors and other third parties dealing with custodians.
    Because a discharge or release for a donative transfer is not necessary, this section had no counterpart in the 1966 Act.
     </p>
     <p>
      This section does not authorize an existing custodian, or a custodian to whom an obligor makes a transfer under section 3217 of this chapter, to settle or release a claim of the minor against a third party. Only a conservator, guardian ad litem or other person authorized under other law to act for the minor may release such a claim.

     </p>
     <p>
      The 1966 Act contained optional bracketed language permitting an adopting state to limit the class of eligible initial custodians to an adult member of the minor's family or a guardian of the minor.
    This optional limitation has been deleted because it would preclude the use of an individual and uncompensated custodian if no qualified or willing family member is available.
     </p>
     <p>
      Otherwise, with respect to transfers of securities, cash, and insurance or annuity contracts, this section tracks the cognate provisions of subsection 2(a) of the 1966 Act, with one exception. Under subsection (a)(1)(ii) of this section, a transfer of securities in registered form may be accomplished without registering the transfer in the name of the custodian so that transfers may be accomplished more expeditiously, and so that securities may be held by custodians in street name. In other words, subsection (a)(1)(i) is not the exclusive manner for making effective transfers of securities in registered form.
     </p>
     <p>
      In addition, subsection (a) creates new procedures for handling the additional types of property now subject to the Act; specifically:
     </p>
     <p>
      Paragraph (3) covers the irrevocable transfer of ownership of life and endowment insurance policies and annuity contracts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Paragraph (4) covers the irrevocable exercise of a power of appointment and the irrevocable present assignment of future payment rights, such as royalties, interest and principal payments under a promissory note, or beneficial interests under life or endowment or annuity insurance contracts or benefit plans.
    The payor, issuer, or obligor may require additional formalities such as completion of a specific assignment form and an endorsement, but the transfer is effective upon delivery of the notification.
    See section 3213 of this chapter and the accompanying Comment for the procedure for revocably "nominating" a future custodian as a beneficiary of a power of appointment or such payment rights.
     </p>
     <p>
      Paragraph (5) is the exclusive method for the transfer of real estate and includes a disposition effected by will.
    Under the law of those states in which a devise of real estate vests in the devisee without the need for a deed from the personal representative of the decedent, a document such as the will must still be "recorded" under this provision to make the transfer effective.
    For inter vivos transfers, of course, a conveyance in recordable form would be employed for dispositions of real estate to a custodian.
     </p>
     <p>
      Paragraph (6) covers the transfer of personal property such as automobiles, aircraft, patent rights, and other property subject to registration of ownership with a state or federal agency.
    Either registration of the transfer in the name of the custodian or delivery of the endorsed certificate in registerable form makes the transfer effective.
     </p>
     <p>
      Paragraph (7) is a residual classification, covering all property not otherwise covered in the preceding paragraphs. Examples would include nonregistered securities, partnership interests, and tangible personal property not subject to title certificates.
     </p>
     <p>
      The form of transfer document recommended and set forth in subsection (b) contains an acceptance that must be executed by the custodian to make the disposition effective.
    While such a form of written acceptance is not specifically required in the case of registered securities under subsection (a)(1), money under (a)(2), insurance contracts or interests under (a)(3) or (4), real estate under (a)(5), or titled personal property under (a)(6), it is certainly the better and recommended practice to obtain the acknowledgment, consent, and acceptance of the designated custodian on the instrument of transfer, or otherwise.

      A transferor may create a custodianship by naming himself as custodian, except for transfers of securities under subsection (a)(1)(ii), insurance and annuity contracts under (a)(3)(ii), and titled personalty under (a)(6)(ii), which are made without registering them in the name of the custodian, and transfers of the residual class of property covered by (a)(7).
    In all of these cases a transfer of possession and control to a third party is necessary to establish donative intent and consummation of the transfer, and designation of the transferor as custodian renders the transfer invalid under section 3221(a)(2) of this chapter.
     </p>
     <p>
      Note, also, that the Internal Revenue Service takes the position that custodial property is includable in the gross estate of the donor if the donor appoints himself or herself custodian and dies while serving in that capacity before the minor attains the age of 21.

      This Act has been drafted in an attempt to avoid income attribution to the parent or inclusion of custodial insurance policies on a custodian's life in the estate of the custodian through the changes made in the standards for expenditure of custodial property and the custodian's incidents of ownership in custodial property.
    See sections 3223 and 3224 of this chapter and the accompanying Comments.
    However, the much greater problem of inclusion of custodial property in the estate of the donor who serves as custodian remains. Therefore, despite the fact that this section of the Act permits it in the case of registered securities, money, life insurance, real estate, and personal property subject to titling laws, it is generally still inadvisable for a donor to appoint himself custodian or for a parent of the minor to serve as custodian.
    See, generally Sections 2036 and 2038 of the Internal Revenue Code and rulings and cases cited above; with respect to gifts of closely held stock when a donor retains voting rights by serving as custodian, see Section 2036(b) of the Internal Revenue Code, overruling
      U.S. v. Byrum,
      408 U.S. 125 (1972), rehearing denied 409 U.S. 898.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (c) tracks in substance Section 2(c) of the 1966 Act.
    However, it replaces the requirement that the transferor "promptly do all things within his power" to complete the transfer, with the requirement that such action must be taken "as soon as practicable."
    This change is intended only to reflect the fact that possession and control of property transferred from an estate can rarely be accomplished with the immediacy that the term "promptly" may have implied.
    In the case of inter vivos transfers, no relaxation of the former requirement is intended, since "prompt" transfer of dominion is usually practicable.

       OFFICIAL COMMENT
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      The first sentence follows Section 2(b) of the 1966 Act.
    The second sentence states what was implicit in the 1966 Act, that additional transfers at different times and from different sources may be made to an existing custodian for the minor and do not create multiple custodianships. This provision also permits an existing custodian to be named as successor custodian by another custodian for the same minor who resigns under section 3228 of this chapter for the purpose of consolidating the assets in a single custodianship.
     </p>
     <p>
      Note, however, that these results are limited to transfers made "under this Act."
    Gifts previously made under the enacting state's UGMA or under the UGMA or UTMA of another state must be treated as separate custodianships, even though the same custodian and minor are involved, because of possible differences in the age of distribution and custodian's powers under those other Acts.
     </p>
     <p>
      Even when all transfers to a single custodian are made "under this Act" and a single custodianship results, custodial property transferred under sections 3216 and 3217 of this chapter must be accounted for separately from property transferred under sections 3214 and 3215 because the custodianship will terminate sooner with respect to the former property if the enacting state has a statutory age of majority lower than 21.

     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (a) generally tracks Section 2(c) of the 1966 Act, except that the transferor's designation of himself as custodian of property for which he is not eligible to serve under section 3219(a)
    of this chapter makes the transfer ineffective.
    See Comment to section 3219.
     </p>
     <p>
      The balance of this section generally tracks Section 3 of the 1966 Act with a number of necessary, and perhaps significant, changes required by the new kinds of property subject to custodianships.
    The 1966 Act provides that a transfer made in accordance with its terms "conveys to the minor indefeasibly vested legal title to the [custodial property]."
    Because equitable interests in property may be the subject of a transfer under this Act, the reference to "legal title" has been deleted, but no change concerning the effect or finality of the transfer is intended.
     </p>
     <p>
      However, subsection (b) qualifies the rights of the minor in the property by making them subject to "the rights, powers, duties and authority" of the custodian under this Act, a concept that may have been implicit and intended in the 1966 Act, but not expressed.
    The concept is important because of the kinds of property, particularly real estate, now subject to custodianship.
    If the minor is married, it would be possible for homestead, dower, or community property rights to attach to real estate (or other property) acquired after marriage by the minor through a transfer to a custodianship for his benefit.
    The quoted language qualifying the minor's interest in the property is intended to override these rights insofar as they may conflict with the custodian's ability and authority to manage, sell, or transfer such property while it is custodial property.
    Upon termination of the custodianship and transfer of the custodial property to the former minor, the custodial property would then become subject to such spousal rights for the first time.
     </p>
     <p>
      For a list of the immunities enjoyed by third persons under subsection (c), see section 3226 of this chapter and the accompanying Comment.
     </p>
     <p>
      Because a custodianship under this Act can extend beyond the age of majority in many states, or beyond emancipation of a minor through marriage or otherwise, the Drafting Committee considered the addition of a spendthrift clause to this section.
    The idea was rejected because neither the 1966 Act nor its predecessors had such a provision, because spendthrift protection would extend only until 21 in any event and judgments against the minor would then be enforceable, and because the spendthrift qualification on the interest of the minor in the property may be inconsistent with the theory of the Act to convey the property indefeasibly to the minor.

     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (a) expands Section 4(a) of the 1966 Act to include the duties to take control and appropriately register or record custodial property in the name of the custodian.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (b) restates and makes somewhat stricter the prudent man fiduciary standard for the custodian, since it is now cast in terms of a prudent person "dealing with property of another" rather than one "who is seeking a reasonable income and the preservation of his capital," as under the 1966 Act.
    The rule also adds a slightly higher standard for professional fiduciaries.
    The rule parallels section 7 - 302 of the Uniform Probate Code in order to refer to the existing and growing body of law interpreting that standard.
    The 1966 Act permitted a custodian to retain any security or bank account received, without the obligation to diversify investment.
    This subsection extends that rule to any property received.
     </p>
     <p>
      In order to eliminate any uncertainty that existed under the 1966 Act, subsection (c) grants specific authority to invest custodial property in life insurance on the minor's life, provided the minor's estate is the sole beneficiary, or on the life of another person in whom the minor has an insurable interest, provided the minor, the minor's estate, or the custodian in his or her custodial capacity is made the beneficiary of such policies.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (d) generally tracks Section 4(g) of the 1966 Act but adds the provision requiring that custodial property consisting of an undivided interest be held as a tenant in common. This provision permits the custodian to invest custodial property in common trust funds, mutual funds, or in a proportional interest in a "jumbo" certificate of deposit.
    Investment in property held in joint tenancy with right of survivorship is not permitted, but the Act does not preclude a transfer of such an interest to a custodian, and the custodian is authorized under subsection (b) to retain a joint tenancy interest so received.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (e) follows Section 4(h) of the 1966 Act, but adds the requirement that income tax information be maintained and made available for preparation of the minor's tax returns. Because the custodianship is not a separate legal entity or taxpayer, the minor's tax identification number should be used to identify all custodial property accounts.

     <p>
      Subsection (a) replaces the specific list of custodian's powers in Section 4(f) of the 1966 Act which related only to securities, money, and insurance, then the only permitted kinds of custodial property.
    It was determined not to expand the list to try to deal with all forms of property now covered by the Act and to specify all powers that might be appropriate for each kind of property, or to refer to an existing body of state law, such as the Trustee's Powers Act, since such powers would not be uniform.
    Instead, this provision grants the custodian the very broad and general powers of an unmarried adult owner of the property, subject to the prudent person rule and to the duties of segregation and record keeping specified in section 3222 of this chapter.
    This approach permits the Act to be self-contained and more readily understandable by volunteer, non-professional fiduciaries, who most often serve as custodians.
    It is intended that the authority granted includes the powers most often suggested for custodians, such as the power to borrow, whether at interest or interest free, the power to invest in common trust funds, and the power to enter contracts that extend beyond the termination of the custodianship.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (a) further specifies that the custodian's powers or incidents of ownership in custodial property such as insurance policies may be exercised only in his capacity as custodian. This provision is intended to prevent the exercise of those powers for the direct or indirect benefit of the custodian, so as to avoid as nearly as possible the result that a custodian who dies while holding an insurance policy on his own life for the benefit of a minor will have the policy taxed in his or her estate.

     </p>
     <p>
      Subsections (a) and (b) track subsections (b) and (c) of Section 4 of the 1966 Act, but with two significant changes. The standard for expenditure of custodial property has been amended to read "for the use and benefit of the minor," rather than 'for the support, maintenance, education and benefit of the minor' as specified under the 1966 Act.
    This change is intended to avoid the implication that the custodial property can be used only for the required support of the minor.
     </p>
     <p>
      The IRS has taken the position that the income from custodial property, to the extent it is used for the support of the minor-donee, is includable in the gross income of any person who is legally obligated to support the minor-donee, whether or not that person or parent is serving as the custodian. Rev. Rul. 56-484, C.B. 1956-2, 23; Rev. Rul. 59-357, C.B. 1959-2, 212.
    However, Reg. 1.662(a)-4 provides that the term "legal obligation" includes a legal obligation to support another person if, and only if, the obligation is not affected by the adequacy of the dependent's own resources.
    Thus, if under local law a parent may use the resources of a child for the child's support in lieu of supporting the child himself or herself, no obligation of support exists, whether or not income is actually used for support, at least if the child's resources are adequate.
    See,
      Bittker, Federal Taxation of Income Estates and Gifts,
      Para. 80.4.4 (1981).
     </p>
     <p>
      For this reason, new subsection (c) has been added to specify that distributions or expenditures may be made for the minor without regard to the duty or ability of any other person to support the minor and that distributions or expenditures are not in substitution for, and shall not affect, the obligation of any person to support the minor.
    Other possible methods of avoiding the attribution of custodial property income to the person obligated to support the minor would be to prohibit the use of custodial property or its income for that purpose, or to provide that any such use gives rise to a cause of action by the minor against his parent to the extent that custodial property or income is so used.
    The first alternative was rejected as too restrictive, and the second as too cumbersome.
     </p>
     <p>
      The "use and benefit" standard in subsections (a) and (b) is intended to include payment of the minor's legally enforceable obligations such as tax or child support obligations or tort claims. Custodial property could be reached by levy of a judgment creditor in any event, so there is no reason not to permit custodian or court-ordered expenditures for enforceable claims.
     </p>
     <p>
      An "interested person" entitled to seek court ordered distributions under subsection (b) would include not only the parent or conservator or guardian of the minor and a transferor or a transferor's legal representative, but also a public agency or official with custody of the minor and a third party to whom the minor owes legally enforceable debts.

       OFFICIAL COMMENT
      </b>
     </p>
     <p>
      This section parallels and restates Section 5 of the 1966 Act.
    It deletes the statement that a custodian may act without compensation for services, since that concept is implied in the retained provision that a custodian has an "election" to be compensated.
    However, to prevent abuse, the latter provision for permissive compensation is denied to a custodian who is also the donor of the custodial property.
     </p>
     <p>
      The custodian's election to charge compensation must be exercised (although the compensation need not be actually paid) at least annually or it lapses and may not be exercised later.
    This provision is intended to avoid imputed income to the custodian who waives compensation, and also to avoid the accumulation of a large unanticipated claim for compensation exercisable at termination of the custodianship.
     </p>

      This section deletes as surplusage the bracketed optional standards contained in the 1966 Act for determining "reasonable compensation" which included, "in the order stated," a direction by the donor, statutes governing compensation of custodians or guardians, or court order. While compensation of custodians becomes a more likely occurrence and a more important issue under this Act because property requiring increased management may now be subject to custodianship, compensation can still be determined by agreement, by reference to a statute or by court order, without the need to so state in this Act.

      This section carries forward, but shortens and simplifies, Section 6 of the 1966 Act, with no substantive change intended.
    The 1966 revision permitted a 14-year old minor to appoint a successor custodian and specifically provided that third parties were entitled to rely on the appointment. Because this section refers to any custodian, and "custodian" is defined to include successor custodians (section 3211(5) of this chapter), a successor custodian appointed by the minor is included among those upon whom third parties may rely.
     </p>
     <p>
      Similarly, because this section protects any third "person," it is not necessary to specify here or in section 3221(c) of this chapter that it extends to any "issuer, transfer agent, bank, life insurance company, broker, or other person or financial institution," as did the 1966 Act.
    See the definition of "person" in section 3211(12).
     </p>
     <p>
      This section excludes from its protection persons with "knowledge" of the irregularity of a transaction, a concept not expressed but probably implied in Section 6 of the 1966 Act.
    See, e.g.,
      State ex rel Paden v. Currel,
      597 S.W.2d 167 (Mo. App. 1980) (disapproving the pledge of custodial property to secure a personal loan to the custodian).

     </p>
     <p>
      This section has no counterpart in the 1966 Act and is based upon Section 5-429 of the Uniform Probate Code, relating to limitations on the liability of conservators.
    Because some forms of custodial property now permitted under this Act can give rise to liabilities as well as benefits (e.g., general partnership interests, interests in real estate or business proprietorships, automobiles, etc.) the Committee believes it is necessary to protect the minor and other assets he or she might have or acquire from such liabilities, since the minor is unable to disclaim a transfer to a custodian for his benefit.
    Similar protection for the custodian is necessary so as not to discourage nonprofessional or uncompensated persons from accepting the office.
    Therefore this section generally limits the claims of third parties to recourse against the custodial property, as third parties dealing with a trust are generally limited to recourse against the trust corpus.
     </p>
     <p>
      The custodian incurs personal liability only as provided in subsection (b) for actual fault or for failure to disclose his or her custodial capacity "in the contract" when contracting with third parties. In oral contracts, oral disclosure of the custodial capacity is sufficient.
    The minor, on the other hand, incurs personal liability under subsection (c) only for actual fault.
     </p>
     <p>
      When custodial property is subjected to claims of third parties under this section, the minor or his or her legal representative, if not a party to the action by which the claim is successfully established, may seek to recover the loss from the custodian in a separate action.
    See section 3229 of this chapter and the accompanying Comment.

      This section tracks but condenses Section 7 of the 1966 Act to provide that the custodian, or if the custodian does not do so, the minor if he or she is 14, may appoint the successor custodian, or failing that, that the conservator of the minor or a court appointee shall serve.
    It also covers disclaimer of the office by designated or successor custodians or by nominated future custodians who decline to serve.

      This Act broadens the category of persons who may be designated by the initial custodian as successor custodian from an adult member of the minor's family, his or her conservator, or a trust company to any adult or trust company.
    However, the minor's designation remains limited to an adult member of his family (expanded to include a spouse and a stepparent, see section 3211(9) of this chapter), the minor's conservator, or a trust company.

      This section carries forward Section 8 of the 1966 Act, but expands the class of parties who may require an accounting by the custodian to include any person who made a transfer to him or her (or any such person's legal representative), the minor's guardian of the person, and the successor custodian.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (b) authorizes but does not obligate a successor custodian to seek an accounting by the predecessor custodian. Since the minor and other persons mentioned in subsection (a) may also seek an accounting from the predecessor at any time, it is anticipated that the exercise of this right by the successor should be rare.
     </p>
     <p>
      Subsection (a) also gives the same parties (other than a successor custodian) the right to seek recovery from the custodian for loss or diminution of custodial property resulting from successful claims by third persons under section 3227 of this chapter, unless that issue has already been adjudicated in an action under that section to which the minor was a party.
     </p>
     <p>
      This section does not contain a separate statute of limitations precluding petitions for accounting after termination of the custodianship.
    Because custodianships can be created without the knowledge of the minor, a person might learn of a custodian's failure to turn over custodial property long after reaching majority, and should not be precluded from asserting his rights in the case of such fraud.
    In addition, the 1966 Act has no such preclusion and seems to have worked well.
    Other law, such as general statutes of limitation and the doctrine of laches, should serve adequately to protect former custodians from harassment.

      This section tracks Section 4(d) of the 1966 Act, but provides that custodianships created by fiduciaries without express authority from the donor of the property under section 3216 of this chapter and by obligors of the minor under section 3217 terminate upon the minor's attaining the age of majority under the general laws of the state, since these custodianships are substitutes for conservatorships that would otherwise terminate at that time.
    Because property in a single custodianship may be distributable at different times, separate accounting for custodial property by source may be required.

    Second, it validates transfers attempted under the UGMA of another state which would not permit transfers from that source or of property of that kind or under the UTMA of another state with no nexus to the transaction, provided in each case that the enacting state has a sufficient nexus to the transaction under section 3212 of this chapter.

      Subsection (a) is new and is based on Section 45-109a of the Connecticut Act which validates gifts of real estate and partnership interests made prior to their inclusion as "custodial property" under that Act.
    However, this provision goes further and purports also to validate prior transfers of the kind now covered by the Act, i.e., transfers from estates, trusts, guardianships, and obligors.
     </p>
     <p>
      All states have previously enacted some version of UGMA, and it will be more orderly to subject gifts or other transfers under the prior Act to the procedures of this Act, rather than to keep both Acts in force, presumably for 18 or 21 years until all custodianships created under prior law have terminated.
    Subsection (b) is intended to apply this Act to prior gifts and existing custodianships insofar as it is constitutionally permissible to do so.
    However, prior custodianships will continue to terminate at the age prescribed under the prior Act.

        "Income beneficiary." The definitions of income beneficiary (subdivision 3322(5)) and income interest (subdivision 3322(6)) cover both mandatory and discretionary beneficiaries and interests.
     There are no definitions for "discretionary income beneficiary" or "discretionary income interest" because those terms are not used in the Act.

        Inventory value.
       </b>
       There is no definition for inventory value in this Act because the provisions in which that term was used in the 1962 Act have either been eliminated (in the case of the underproductive property provision) or changed in a way that eliminates the need for the term (in the case of bonds and other money obligations, property subject to depletion, and the method for determining entitlement to income distributed from a probate estate).

        "Net income."

       The reference to "transfers under this Act to or from income" means transfers made under subsections 3324(a), 3362(b), 3372(b), 3373(b), 3374(a), and section 3376.

       This term was chosen in preference to "terms of the trust instrument" (the phrase used in the 1962 Act) to make it clear that the Act applies to oral trusts as well as those whose terms are expressed in written documents.
    The definition is based on the Restatement (Second) of Trusts

        Prior Act.
       </b>
       The rule in Section 2(a) of the 1962 Act is restated in subsection 3323(a), without changing its substance, to emphasize that the Act contains only default rules and that provisions in the terms of the trust are paramount.
    However, Section 2(a) of the 1962 Act applies only to the allocation of receipts and disbursements to or between principal and income.
    In this Act, the first sentence of subsection 3323(a) states that it also applies to matters within the scope of subchapters 2 and 3.
    Subdivision 3323(a)(2) incorporates the rule in Section 2(b) of the 1962 Act that a discretionary allocation made by the trustee that is contrary to a rule in the Act should not give rise to an inference of imprudence or partiality by the trustee.
      </p>
      <p>
       The Act deletes the language that appears at the end of Section (2)(a)(3)(B) of the 1962 Act
    ("and in view of the manner in which men of ordinary prudence, discretion and judgment would act in the management of their affairs") because persons of ordinary prudence, discretion and judgment, acting in the management of their own affairs do not normally think in terms of the interests of successive beneficiaries. If there is an analogy to an individual's decision making process, it is probably the individual's decision to spend or to save, but this is not a useful guideline for trust administration.
    No case has been found in which a court has relied on the "prudent man" rule of the 1962 Act.

        Fiduciary discretion.

       The general rule is that if a discretionary power is conferred upon a trustee, the exercise of that power is not subject to control by a court except to prevent an abuse of discretion.

        Questions for which there is no provision.
       </b>
       Subdivision 3323(a)(4) allocates receipts and disbursements to principal when there is no provision for a different allocation in the terms of the trust, the will, or the Act.
    This may occur because money is received from a financial instrument not available at the present time (inflation-indexed bonds might have fallen into this category had they been announced after this Act was approved by the Commissioners on Uniform State Laws) or because a transaction is of a type or occurs in a manner not anticipated by the Drafting Committee for this Act or the drafter of the trust instrument.
      </p>
      <p>
       Allocating to principal a disbursement for which there is no provision in the Act or the terms of the trust preserves the income beneficiary's level of income in the year it is allocated to principal, but thereafter will reduce the amount of income produced by the principal.
    Allocating to principal a receipt for which there is no provision will increase the income received by the income beneficiary in subsequent years, and will eventually, upon termination of the trust, also favor the remainder beneficiary.
    Allocating these items to principal implements the rule that requires a trustee to administer the trust impartially, based on what is fair and reasonable to both income and remainder beneficiaries. However, if the trustee decides that an adjustment between principal and income is needed to enable the trustee to comply with subsection 3323(b), after considering the return from the portfolio as a whole, the trustee may make an appropriate adjustment under subsection 3324(a).

        Duty of impartiality.
       </b>
       Whenever there are two or more beneficiaries, a trustee is under a duty to deal impartially with them.
    Restatement of Trusts 3d: Prudent Investor Rule
       §
       183 (1992).
    This rule applies whether the beneficiaries' interests in the trust are concurrent or successive.
    If the terms of the trust give the trustee discretion to favor one beneficiary over another, a court will not control the exercise of such discretion except to prevent the trustee from abusing it.

      <p>
       The terms of a trust may provide that the trustee, or an accountant engaged by the trustee, or a committee of persons who may be family members or business associates, shall have the power to determine what is income and what is principal. If the terms of a trust provide that this Act specifically or principal and income legislation in general does not apply to the trust but fail to provide a rule to deal with a matter provided for in this Act, the trustee has an implied grant of discretion to decide the question.
    Subsection 3323(b) provides that the rule of impartiality applies in the exercise of such a discretionary power to the extent that the terms of the trust do not provide that one or more of the beneficiaries are to be favored.
    The fact that a person is named an income beneficiary or a remainder beneficiary is not by itself an indication of partiality for that beneficiary.

        Purpose and Scope of Provision.
       </b>
       The purpose of section 3324 is to enable a trustee to select investments using the standards of a prudent investor without having to realize a particular portion of the portfolio's total return in the form of traditional trust accounting income such as interest, dividends, and rents.
    Subsection 3324(a) authorizes a trustee to make adjustments between principal and income if three conditions are met: (1) the trustee must be managing the trust assets under the prudent investor rule; (2) the terms of the trust must express the income beneficiary's distribution rights in terms of the right to receive "income" in the sense of traditional trust accounting income; and (3) the trustee must determine, after applying the rules in subsection 3323(a), that he is unable to comply with subsection 3323(b). In deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the power to adjust, the trustee is required to consider the factors described in subsection 3324(b), but the trustee may not make an adjustment in circumstances described in subsection 3324(c).
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 3324 does not empower a trustee to increase or decrease the degree of beneficial enjoyment to which a beneficiary is entitled under the terms of the trust; rather, it authorizes the trustee to make adjustments between principal and income that may be necessary if the income component of a portfolio's total return is too small or too large because of investment decisions made by the trustee under the prudent investor rule.
    The paramount consideration in applying subsection 3324(a) is the requirement in subsection 3323(b) that "a fiduciary must administer a trust or estate impartially, based on what is fair and reasonable to all of the beneficiaries, except to the extent that the terms of the trust or the will clearly manifest an intention that the fiduciary shall or may favor one or more of the beneficiaries."
    The power to adjust is subject to control by the court to prevent an abuse of discretion.

      <p>
       Section 3324 will be important for trusts that are irrevocable when a state adopts the prudent investor rule by statute or judicial approval of the rule contained in the Restatement of Trusts 3d: Prudent Investor Rule.
    Wills and trust instruments executed after the rule is adopted can be drafted to describe a beneficiary's distribution rights in terms that do not depend upon the amount of trust accounting income, but to the extent that drafters of trust documents continue to describe an income beneficiary's distribution rights by referring to trust accounting income, Section 3324 will be an important tool in trust administration.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Three conditions to the exercise of the power to adjust.
       </b>
       The first of the three conditions that must be met before a trustee can exercise the power to adjust - that the trustee invest and manage trust assets as a prudent investor - is expressed in this Act by language derived from the Uniform Prudent Investor Act, but the condition will be met whether the prudent investor rule applies because the Uniform Act or other prudent investor legislation has been enacted, the prudent investor rule has been approved by the courts, or the terms of the trust require it.
    Even if a state's legislature or courts have not formally adopted the rule, the Restatement establishes the prudent investor rule as an authoritative interpretation of the common law prudent man rule, referring to the prudent investor rule as a "modest reformulation of the Harvard College dictum and the basic rule of prior Restatements."
    Restatement of Trusts 3d: Prudent Investor Rule, Introduction, at 5.
    As a result, there is a basis for concluding that the first condition is satisfied in virtually all states except those in which a trustee is permitted to invest only in assets set forth in a statutory "legal list."
      </p>
      <p>
       The second condition will be met when the terms of the trust require all of the "income" to be distributed at regular intervals; or when the terms of the trust require a trustee to distribute all of the income, but permit the trustee to decide how much to distribute to each member of a class of beneficiaries; or when the terms of a trust provide that the beneficiary shall receive the greater of the trust accounting income and a fixed dollar amount (an annuity), or of trust accounting income and a fractional share of the value of the trust assets (a unitrust amount).
    If the trust authorizes the trustee in its discretion to distribute the trust's income to the beneficiary or to accumulate some or all of the income, the condition will be met because the terms of the trust do not permit the trustee to distribute more than the trust accounting income.
      </p>
      <p>
       To meet the third condition, the trustee must first meet the requirements of subsection 3323(a), i.e., she must apply the terms of the trust, decide whether to exercise the discretionary powers given to the trustee under the terms of the trust, and must apply the provisions of the Act if the terms of the trust do not contain a different provision or give the trustee discretion.
    Second, the trustee must determine the extent to which the terms of the trust clearly manifest an intention by the settlor that the trustee may or must favor one or more of the beneficiaries.
    To the extent that the terms of the trust do not require partiality, the trustee must conclude that she is unable to comply with the duty to administer the trust impartially.
    To the extent that the terms of the trust do require or permit the trustee to favor the income beneficiary or the remainder beneficiary, the trustee must conclude that she is unable to achieve the degree of partiality required or permitted.
    If the trustee comes to either conclusion - that she is unable to administer the trust impartially or that she is unable to achieve the degree of partiality required or permitted - she may exercise the power to adjust under subsection 3324(a).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Impartiality and productivity of income.
       </b>
       The duty of impartiality between income and remainder beneficiaries is linked to the trustee's duty to make the portfolio productive of trust accounting income whenever the distribution requirements are expressed in terms of distributing the trust's "income."
    The 1962 Act implies that the duty to produce income applies on an asset by asset basis because the right of an income beneficiary to receive "delayed income" from the sale proceeds of underproductive property under section 12 of that Act arises if "any part of principal ... has not produced an average net income of at least 1% per year of its inventory value for more than a year . . . ." Under the prudent investor rule, "[t]o whatever extent a requirement of income productivity exists, ... the requirement applies not investment by investment but to the portfolio as a whole."
    Restatement of Trusts 3d: Prudent Investor Rule
       §
       227, comment i, at 34.
    The power to adjust under subsection 3324(a) is also to be exercised by considering net income from the portfolio as a whole and not investment by investment. Subsection 3363(b) of this Act eliminates the underproductive property rule in all cases other than trusts for which a marital deduction is allowed; the rule applies to a marital deduction trust if the trust's assets "consist substantially of property that does not provide the spouse with sufficient income from or use of the trust assets . . ." - in other words, the section applies by reference to the portfolio as a whole.

       While the purpose of the power to adjust in subsection 3324(a) is to eliminate the need for a trustee who operates under the prudent investor rule to be concerned about the income component of the portfolio's total return, the trustee must still determine the extent to which a distribution must be made to an income beneficiary and the adequacy of the portfolio's liquidity as a whole to make that distribution.

        Factors to consider in exercising the power to adjust.
       </b>
       Subsection 3324(b) requires a trustee to consider factors relevant to the trust and its beneficiaries in deciding whether and to what extent the power to adjust should be exercised.
    Section 2(c) of the Uniform Prudent Investor Act sets forth circumstances that a trustee is to consider in investing and managing trust assets.
    The circumstances in Section 2(c) of the Uniform Prudent Investor Act are the source of the factors in subdivisions (3)-(6) and (8) of subsection 3324(b) (modified where necessary to adapt them to the purposes of this Act) so that, to the extent possible, comparable factors will apply to investment decisions and decisions involving the power to adjust.
    If a trustee who is operating under the prudent investor rule decides that the portfolio should be composed of financial assets whose total return will result primarily from capital appreciation rather than dividends, interest, and rents, the trustee can decide at the same time the extent to which an adjustment from principal to income may be necessary under section 3324.
    On the other hand, if a trustee decides that the risk and return objectives for the trust are best achieved by a portfolio whose total return includes interest and dividend income that is sufficient to provide the income beneficiary with the beneficial interest to which the beneficiary is entitled under the terms of the trust, the trustee can decide that it is unnecessary to exercise the power to adjust.

        Assets received from the settlor.
       </b>
       Section 3 of the Uniform Prudent Investor Act provides that "[a] trustee shall diversify the investments of the trust unless the trustee reasonably determines that, because of special circumstances, the purposes of the trust are better served without diversifying."
    The special circumstances may include the wish to retain a family business, the benefit derived from deferring liquidation of the asset in order to defer payment of income taxes, or the anticipated capital appreciation from retaining an asset such as undeveloped real estate for a long period.
    To the extent the trustee retains assets received from the settlor because of special circumstances that overcome the duty to diversify, the trustee may take these circumstances into account in determining whether and to what extent the power to adjust should be exercised to change the results produced by other provisions of this Act that apply to the retained assets.

        Limitations on the power to adjust.
       </b>
       The purpose of subdivisions (c)(1)-(4) is to preserve tax benefits that may have been an important purpose for creating the trust. Subdivisions (c)(5), (6), and (8) deny the power to adjust in the circumstances described in those subsections in order to prevent adverse tax consequences, and subdivision (c)(7) denies the power to adjust to any beneficiary, whether or not possession of the power may have adverse tax consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under subdivision (c)(1), a trustee cannot make an adjustment that diminishes the income interest in a trust that requires all of the income to be paid at least annually to a spouse and for which an estate tax or gift tax marital deduction is allowed; but this subsection does not prevent the trustee from making an adjustment that increases the amount of income paid from a marital deduction trust to the spouse.
    Subdivision (c)(1) applies to a trust that qualifies for the marital deduction because the spouse has a general power of appointment over the trust, but it applies to a qualified terminable interest property (QTIP) trust only if and to the extent that the fiduciary makes the election required to obtain the tax deduction. Subdivision (c)(1) does not apply to a so-called "estate" trust.
    This type of trust qualifies for the marital deduction because the terms of the trust require the principal and undistributed income to be paid to the surviving spouse's estate when the spouse dies; it is not necessary for the terms of an estate trust to require the income to be distributed annually.

       26.2056(c)-2(b)(1)(iii).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subdivision (c)(3) applies to annuity trusts and unitrusts with no charitable beneficiaries as well as to trusts with charitable income or remainder beneficiaries; its purpose is to make it clear that a beneficiary's right to receive a fixed annuity or a fixed fraction of the value of a trust's assets is not subject to adjustment under subsection 3324(a). Subdivision (c)(3) does not apply to any additional amount to which the beneficiary may be entitled that is expressed in terms of a right to receive income from the trust.
    For example, if a beneficiary is to receive a fixed annuity or the trust's income, whichever is greater, subdivision (c)(3) does not prevent a trustee from making an adjustment under subsection 3324(a) in determining the amount of the trust's income.
      </p>
      <p>
       If subdivision (c)(5), (6), (7), or (8), prevents a trustee from exercising the power to adjust, subsection (d) permits a cotrustee who is not subject to the provision to exercise the power unless the terms of the trust do not permit the cotrustee to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Release of the power to adjust.
       </b>
       Subsection 3324(e) permits a trustee to release all or part of the power to adjust in circumstances in which the possession or exercise of the power might deprive the trust of a tax benefit or impose a tax burden.
    For example, if possessing the power would diminish the actuarial value of the income interest in a trust for which the income beneficiary's estate may be eligible to claim a credit for property previously taxed if the beneficiary dies within ten years after the death of the person creating the trust, the trustee is permitted under subsection (e) to release just the power to adjust from income to principal.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Trust terms that limit a power to adjust.
       </b>
       Subsection 3324(f) applies to trust provisions that limit a trustee's power to adjust.
    Since the power is intended to enable trustees to employ the prudent investor rule without being constrained by traditional principal and income rules, an instrument executed before the adoption of this Act whose terms describe the amount that may or must be distributed to a beneficiary by referring to the trust's income or that prohibit the invasion of principal or that prohibit equitable adjustments in general should not be construed as forbidding the use of the power to adjust under subsection 3324(a) if the need for adjustment arises because the trustee is operating under the prudent investor rule.
    Instruments containing such provisions that are executed after the adoption of this Act should specifically refer to the power to adjust if the settlor intends to forbid its use.

    T has received from the prior trustee a portfolio of financial assets invested 20% in stocks and 80% in bonds.
    Following the prudent investor rule, T determines that a strategy of investing the portfolio 50% in stocks and 50% in bonds has risk and return objectives that are reasonably suited to the trust, but T also determines that adopting this approach will cause the trust to receive a smaller amount of dividend and interest income.
    After considering the factors in subsection 3324(b), T may transfer cash from principal to income to the extent T considers it necessary to increase the amount distributed to the income beneficiary.

       B T is the trustee of a trust that requires the income to be paid to the settlor's son C for life, remainder to C's daughter D.
    In a period of very high inflation, T purchases bonds that pay double-digit interest and determines that a portion of the interest, which is allocated to income under section 3356, is a return of capital.
    In consideration of the loss of value of principal due to inflation and other factors that T considers relevant, T may transfer part of the interest to principal.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Example (3)
       </b>
       B T is the trustee of a trust that requires the income to be paid to the settlor's sister E for life, remainder to charity F.
    E is a retired schoolteacher who is single and has no children.
    E's income from her social security, pension, and savings exceeds the amount required to provide for her accustomed standard of living.
    The terms of the trust permit T to invade principal to provide for E's health and to support her in her accustomed manner of living, but do not otherwise indicate that T should favor E or F. Applying the prudent investor rule, T determines that the trust assets should be invested entirely in growth stocks that produce very little dividend income.
    Even though it is not necessary to invade principal to maintain E's accustomed standard of living, she is entitled to receive from the trust the degree of beneficial enjoyment normally accorded a person who is the sole income beneficiary of a trust, and T may transfer cash from principal to income to provide her with that degree of enjoyment.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Example (4)
       </b>
       B T is the trustee of a trust that is governed by the law of State X.
    The trust became irrevocable before State X adopted the prudent investor rule.
    The terms of the trust require all of the income to be paid to G for life, remainder to H, and also give T the power to invade principal for the benefit of G for "dire emergencies only." The terms of the trust limit the aggregate amount that T can distribute to G from principal during G's life to 6% of the trust's value at its inception.
    The trust's portfolio is invested initially 50% in stocks and 50% in bonds, but after State X adopts the prudent investor rule T determines that, to achieve suitable risk and return objectives for the trust, the assets should be invested 90% in stocks and 10% in bonds. This change increases the total return from the portfolio and decreases the dividend and interest income.
    Thereafter, even though G does not experience a dire emergency, T may exercise the power to adjust under subsection 3324(a) to the extent that T determines that the adjustment is from only the capital appreciation resulting from the change in the portfolio's asset allocation.
    If T is unable to determine the extent to which capital appreciation resulted from the change in asset allocation or is unable to maintain adequate records to determine the extent to which principal distributions to G for dire emergencies do not exceed the 6% limitation, T may not exercise the power to adjust.

    The trust owns a diversified portfolio of marketable financial assets with a value of $600,000, and is also the sole beneficiary of the settlor's IRA, which holds a diversified portfolio of marketable financial assets with a value of $900,000.
    The trust receives a distribution from the IRA that is the minimum amount required to be distributed under the Internal Revenue Code, and T allocates 10% of the distribution to income under subsection 3359(c).
    The total return on the IRA's assets exceeds the amount distributed to the trust, and the value of the IRA at the end of the year is more than its value at the beginning of the year.
    Relevant factors that T may consider in determining whether to exercise the power to adjust and the extent to which an adjustment should be made to comply with subsection 3323(b) include the total return from all of the trust's assets, those owned directly as well as its interest in the IRA, the extent to which the trust will be subject to income tax on the portion of the IRA distribution that is allocated to principal, and the extent to which the income beneficiary will be subject to income tax on the amount that T distributes to the income beneficiary.

      <p>
       <b>
        General.
       </b>
       All of the discretionary powers in the 1997 Act are subject to the normal rules that govern a fiduciary's exercise of discretion.
    Section 3325 codifies those rules for purposes of the Act so that they will be readily apparent and accessible to fiduciaries, beneficiaries, their counsel and the courts if and when questions concerning such powers arise.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 3325 also makes clear that the normal rules governing the exercise of a fiduciary's powers apply to the discretionary power to adjust conferred upon a trustee by subsection 3324(a).
    Discretionary provisions authorizing trustees to determine what is income and what is principal have been used in governing instruments for years; Section 2 of the 1931 Uniform Principal and Income Act recognized that practice by providing that "the person establishing the principal may himself direct the manner of ascertainment of income and principal . . . or grant discretion to the trustee or other person to do so . . . ."
    Subdivision 3323(a)(2) also recognizes the power of a settlor to grant such discretion to the trustee.
    Section 3325 applies to a discretionary power granted by the terms of a trust or a will as well as the power to adjust in subsection 3324(a).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Power to Adjust.
       </b>
       The exercise of the power to adjust is governed by a trustee's duty of impartiality, which requires the trustee to strike an appropriate balance between the interests of the income and remainder beneficiaries. Subsection 3323(b) expresses this duty by requiring the trustee to "administer a trust or estate impartially, based on what is fair and reasonable to all of the beneficiaries, except to the extent that the terms of the trust or the will clearly manifest an intention that the fiduciary shall or may favor one or more of the beneficiaries."
    Because this involves the exercise of judgment in circumstances rarely capable of perfect resolution, trustees are not expected to achieve perfection; they are, however, required to make conscious decisions in good faith and with proper motives.
      </p>
      <p>
       In seeking the proper balance between the interests of the beneficiaries in matters involving principal and income, a trustee's traditional approach has been to determine the settlor's objectives from the terms of the trust, gather the information needed to ascertain the financial circumstances of the beneficiaries, determine the extent to which the settlor's objectives can be achieved with the resources available in the trust, and then allocate the trust's assets between stocks and fixed-income securities in a way that will produce a particular level or range of income for the income beneficiary.
    The key element in this process has been to determine the appropriate level or range of income for the income beneficiary, and that will continue to be the key element in deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the discretionary power conferred by subsection 3324(a).
    If it becomes necessary for a court to determine whether an abuse of the discretionary power to adjust between principal and income has occurred, the criteria should be the same as those that courts have used in the past to determine whether a trustee has abused its discretion in allocating the trust's assets between stocks and fixed-income securities.
      </p>
      <p>
       A fiduciary has broad latitude in choosing the methods and criteria to use in deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the power to adjust in order to achieve impartiality between income beneficiaries and remainder beneficiaries or the degree of partiality for one or the other that is provided for by the terms of the trust or the will.
    For example, in deciding what the appropriate level or range of income should be for the income beneficiary and whether to exercise the power, a trustee may use the methods employed prior to the adoption of the 1997 Act in deciding how to allocate trust assets between stocks and fixed-income securities; or may consider the amount that would be distributed each year based on a percentage of the portfolio's value at the beginning or end of an accounting period, or the average portfolio value for several accounting periods, in a manner similar to a unitrust, and may select a percentage that the trustee believes is appropriate for this purpose and use the same percentage or different percentages in subsequent years. The trustee may also use hypothetical portfolios of marketable securities to determine an appropriate level or range of income within which a distribution might fall.
      </p>
      <p>
       An adjustment may be made prospectively at the beginning of an accounting period, based on a projected return or range of returns for a trust's portfolio, or retrospectively after the fiduciary knows the total realized or unrealized return for the period; and instead of an annual adjustment, the trustee may distribute a fixed dollar amount for several years, in a manner similar to an annuity, and may change the fixed dollar amount periodically.
    No inference of abuse is to be drawn if a fiduciary uses different methods or criteria for the same trust from time to time, or uses different methods or criteria for different trusts for the same accounting period.
      </p>
      <p>
       While a trustee must consider the portfolio as a whole in deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the power to adjust, a trustee may apply different criteria in considering the portion of the portfolio that is composed of marketable securities and the portion whose market value cannot be determined readily, and may take into account a beneficiary's use or possession of a trust asset.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the prudent investor rule, a trustee is to incur costs that are appropriate and reasonable in relation to the assets and the purposes of the trust, and the same consideration applies in determining whether and to what extent to exercise the power to adjust.
    In making investment decisions under the prudent investor rule, the trustee will have considered the purposes, terms, distribution requirements, and other circumstances of the trust for the purpose of adopting an overall investment strategy having risk and return objectives reasonably suited to the trust.
    A trustee is not required to duplicate that work for principal and income purposes, and in many cases the decision about whether and to what extent to exercise the power to adjust may be made at the same time as the investment decisions.
    To help achieve the objective of reasonable investment costs, a trustee may also adopt policies that apply to all trusts or to individual trusts or classes of trusts, based on their size or other criteria, stating whether and under what circumstances the power to adjust will be exercised and the method of making adjustments; no inference of abuse is to be drawn if a trustee adopts such policies.

       50 of the Third Restatement.
      </p>
      <p>
       The reference in subsection 3325(a) to a fiduciary's decision to exercise or not to exercise a discretionary power underscores a fundamental precept, which is that a fiduciary has a duty to make a conscious decision about exercising or not exercising a discretionary power. Comment
       b

       §
       50 of the Third Restatement states:
      </p>
      <p>
       [A] court will intervene where the exercise of a power is left to the judgment of a trustee who improperly fails to exercise that judgment.
    Thus, even where a trustee has discretion whether or not to make any payments to a particular beneficiary, the court will interpose if the trustee, arbitrarily or without knowledge of or inquiry into relevant circumstances, fails to exercise the discretion.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection 3325(b) makes clear that the rule of subsection (a) applies not only to the power conferred by subsection 3324(a) but also to the evaluation process required by subsection 3324(b) in deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the power to adjust.
    Under subsection 3324(b), a trustee is to consider all of the factors that are relevant to the trust and its beneficiaries, including, to the extent the trustee determines they are relevant, the nine factors enumerated in subsection 3324(b).
    Subsection 3324(b) derives from Section 2(c) of the Uniform Prudent Investor Act, which lists eight circumstances that a trustee shall consider, to the extent they are relevant, in investing and managing assets.
    The trustee's decisions about what factors are relevant for purposes of subsection 3324(b) and the weight to be accorded each of the relevant factors are part of the discretionary decision-making process.
    As such, these decisions are not subject to change for the purpose of changing the trustee's ultimate decision unless the court determines that there has been an abuse of discretion in determining the relevancy and weight of these factors.

        Remedy.
       </b>
       The exercise or nonexercise of a discretionary power under the Act normally affects the amount or timing of a distribution to the income or remainder beneficiaries.
    The primary remedy under subsection 3325(c) for abuse of discretion is the restoration of the beneficiaries and the trust to the positions they would have occupied if the abuse had not occurred.
    It draws on a basic principle of restitution that if a person pays money to someone who is not intended to receive it (and in a case to which this Act applies, not intended by the settlor to receive it in the absence of an abuse of discretion by the trustee), that person is entitled to restitution on the ground that the payee would be unjustly enriched if he were permitted to retain the payment.
    See Restatement of Restitution
       §
       22 (1937).
    The objective is to accomplish the restoration initially by making adjustments between the beneficiaries and the trust to the extent possible; to the extent that restoration is not possible by such adjustments, a court may order the trustee to pay an amount to one or more of the beneficiaries, the trust, or both the beneficiaries and the trust.
    If the court determines that it is not possible in the circumstances to restore them to their appropriate positions, the court may provide other remedies appropriate to the circumstances.
    The approach of subsection 3325(c) is supported by comment

       "When judicial intervention is required, a court may direct the trustee to make or refrain from making certain payments; issue instructions to clarify the standards or guidelines applicable to the exercise of the power; or rescind the trustee's payment decisions, usually directing the trustee to recover amounts improperly distributed and holding the trustee liable for failure or inability to do so[.]"

        Advance determinations.
       </b>
       Subsection 3325(d) employs the familiar remedy of the trustee's petition to the court for instructions.
    It requires the court to determine, upon a petition by the fiduciary, whether a proposed exercise or nonexercise of a discretionary power by the fiduciary of a power conferred by the Act would be an abuse of discretion under the general rule of subsection 3325(a).
    If the petition contains the information prescribed in the second sentence of subsection (d), the proposed action or inaction is presumed not to result in an abuse, and a beneficiary who challenges the proposal must establish that it will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (d) is intended to provide a fiduciary the opportunity to obtain an assurance of finality in a judicial proceeding before proceeding with a proposed exercise or nonexercise of a discretionary power.
    Its purpose is not, however, to have the court instruct the fiduciary how to exercise the discretion.
      </p>
      <p>
       A fiduciary may also obtain the consent of the beneficiaries to a proposed act or an omission to act, and a beneficiary cannot hold the fiduciary liable for that act or omission unless:
      </p>
      <ol type="a">
       <li id="t14p04c118sub01s3325-historyol1a">

       <li id="t14p04c118sub01s3325-historyol1b">
        the beneficiary, when he gave his consent, did not know of his rights and of the material facts which the trustee knew or should have known and which the trustee did not reasonably believe that the beneficiary knew; or
       </li>
       <li id="t14p04c118sub01s3325-historyol1c">

       <b>
        Terminating income interests and successive income interests. A trust that provides for a single income beneficiary and an outright distribution of the remainder ends when the income interest ends.
     A more complex trust may have a number of income interests, either concurrent or successive, and the trust will not necessarily end when one of the income interests ends.
     For that reason, the Act speaks in terms of income interests ending and beginning rather than trusts ending and beginning.
     When an income interest in a trust ends, the trustee's powers continue during the winding up period required to complete its administration.
     A terminating income interest is one that has ended but whose administration is not complete.
       </b>
      </p>
      <p>
       If two or more people are given the right to receive specified percentages or fractions of the income from a trust concurrently and one of the concurrent interests ends, e.g., when a beneficiary dies, the beneficiary's income interest ends but the trust does not.
    Similarly, when a trust with only one income beneficiary ends upon the beneficiary's death, the trust instrument may provide that part or all of the trust assets shall continue in trust for another income beneficiary.
    While it is common to think and speak of this (and even to characterize it in a trust instrument) as a "new" trust, it is a continuation of the original trust for a remainder beneficiary who has an income interest in the trust assets instead of the right to receive them outright.
    For purposes of this Act, this is a successive income interest in the same trust.
    The fact that a trust may or may not end when an income interest ends is not significant for purposes of this Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the assets that are subject to a terminating income interest pass to another trust because the income beneficiary exercises a general power of appointment over the trust assets, the recipient trust would be a new trust; and if they pass to another trust because the beneficiary exercises a nongeneral power of appointment over the trust assets, the recipient trust might be a new trust in some States (see 5A Austin W. Scott & William F. Fratcher, The Law of Trusts
       §
       640, at 483 (4th ed. 1989)); but for purposes of this Act a new trust created in these circumstances is also a successive income interest.
      </p>

       <b>
        Gift of a pecuniary amount.
       </b>
       Subdivisions 3331(3) and (4) provide different rules for an outright gift of a pecuniary amount and a gift in trust of a pecuniary amount; this is the same approach used in Section 5(b)(2) of the 1962 Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Interest on pecuniary amounts.
       </b>
       Subdivision 3331(3) provides that the beneficiary of an outright pecuniary amount is to receive the interest or other amount provided by applicable law if there is no provision in the will or the terms of the trust.
    Many states have no applicable law that provides for interest or some other amount to be paid on an outright pecuniary gift under an inter vivos trust; this section provides that in such a case the interest or other amount to be paid shall be the same as the interest or other amount required to be paid on testamentary pecuniary gifts. This provision is intended to accord gifts under inter vivos instruments the same treatment as testamentary gifts.
    The various state authorities that provide for the amount that a beneficiary of an outright pecuniary amount is entitled to receive are collected in Richard B. Covey, Marital Deduction and Credit Shelter Dispositions and the Use of Formula Provisions, App. B (4th ed. 1997).

       <b>
        Administration expenses and interest on death taxes.
       </b>
       Under subdivision 3331(2)(B) a fiduciary may pay administration expenses and interest on death taxes from either income or principal.
    An advantage of permitting the fiduciary to choose the source of the payment is that, if the fiduciary's decision is consistent with the decision to deduct these expenses for income tax purposes or estate tax purposes, it eliminates the need to adjust between principal and income that may arise when, for example, an expense that is paid from principal is deducted for income tax purposes or an expense that is paid from income is deducted for estate tax purposes.
      </p>
      <p>
       The United States Supreme Court has considered the question of whether an estate tax marital deduction or charitable deduction should be reduced when administration expenses are paid from income produced by property passing in trust for a surviving spouse or for charity and deducted for income tax purposes.
    The Court rejected the IRS position that administration expenses properly paid from income under the terms of the trust or state law must reduce the amount of a marital or charitable transfer, and held that the value of the transferred property is not reduced for estate tax purposes unless the administration expenses are material in light of the income the trust corpus could have been expected to generate.
       Commissioner v. Estate of Otis C. Hubert,
       117 S. Ct. 1124 (1997).
    The provision in subdivision 3331(2)(B) permits a fiduciary to pay and deduct administration expenses from income only to the extent that it will not cause the reduction or loss of an estate tax marital or charitable contributions deduction, which means that the limit on the amount payable from income will be established eventually by Treasury Regulations.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Interest on estate taxes.
       </b>
       The IRS agrees that interest on estate and inheritance taxes may be deducted for income tax purposes without having to reduce the estate tax deduction for amounts passing to a charity or surviving spouse, whether the interest is paid from principal or income.
    Rev. Rul. 93-48, 93-2 C.B. 270.
    For estates of persons who died before 1998, a fiduciary may not want to deduct for income tax purposes interest on estate tax that is deferred under section 6166 or 6163 of the Internal Revenue Code because deducting that interest for estate tax purposes may produce more beneficial results, especially if the estate has little or no income or the income tax bracket is significantly lower than the estate tax bracket.
    For estates of persons who die after 1997, no estate tax or income tax deduction will be allowed for interest paid on estate tax that is deferred under section 6166.
    However, interest on estate tax deferred under section 6163 will continue to be deductible for both purposes, and interest on estate tax deficiencies will continue to be deductible for estate tax purposes if an election under section 6166 is not in effect.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under the 1962 Act, Section 13(c)(5) charges interest on estate and inheritance taxes to principal.
    The 1931 Act has no provision.
    Subdivision 3371(3) of this title provides that, except to the extent provided in subdivision 3331(2)(B) or (C), all interest must be paid from income.

        Determination and Distribution of Net Income.
       </b>
       The Vermont Act adds qualifying language to subdivision 3331(3) providing that "(u)nless the will or trust instrument otherwise provides, or the court otherwise directs(,)" and then goes on to provide that interest on a pecuniary bequest only begins to accrue one year from the date of death pursuant to
       Woodward's Estate v. Holton et al.,
       78 Vt. 254 (1909).
    This appears to be the only instance where the uniform act deviates from Vermont law, which the additional language preserves here. To conform to this change, the following language is deleted at the end of subdivision (4): "including a beneficiary who receives a pecuniary amount in trust, even if the beneficiary holds an unqualified power to withdraw assets from the trust or other presently exercisable general power of appointment over the trust."

        Relationship to prior Acts.
       </b>
       Section 3332 retains the concept in Section 5(b)(2) of the 1962 Act that the residuary legatees of estates are to receive net income earned during the period of administration on the basis of their proportionate interests in the undistributed assets when distributions are made.
    It changes the basis for determining their proportionate interests by using asset values as of a date reasonably near the time of distribution instead of inventory values; it extends the application of these rules to distributions from terminating trusts; and it extends these rules to gain or loss realized from the disposition of assets during administration, an omission in the 1962 Act that has been noted by several commentators.
    See, e.g., Richard B. Covey, Marital Deduction and Credit Shelter Dispositions and the Use of Formula Provisions 91 (4th ed. 1998); Thomas H. Cantrill, Fractional or Percentage Residuary Bequests: Allocation of Postmortem Income, Gain and Unrealized Appreciation, 10 Prob. Notes 322, 327 (1985).

        Period during which there is no beneficiary. The purpose of the second part of subsection (d) is to provide that, at the end of a period during which there is no beneficiary to whom a trustee may distribute income, the trustee must apply the same apportionment rules that apply when a mandatory income interest ends.
     This provision would apply, for example, if a settlor creates a trust for grandchildren before any grandchildren are born.
     When the first grandchild is born, the period preceding the date of birth is treated as having ended, followed by a successive income interest, and the apportionment rules in sections 3342 and 3343 apply accordingly if the terms of the trust do not contain different provisions.

        Prior Acts.
       </b>
       Professor Bogert stated that "Section 4 of the [1962] Act makes a change with respect to the apportionment of the income of trust property not due until after the trust began but which accrued in part before the commencement of the trust.
    It treats such income as to be credited entirely to the income account in the case of a living trust, but to be apportioned between capital and income in the case of a testamentary trust.
    The [1931] Act apportions such income in the case of both types of trusts, except in the case of corporate dividends."
    George G. Bogert, The Revised Uniform Principal and Income Act, 38 Notre Dame Law Rev. 50, 52 (1962).
    The 1962 Act also provides that an asset passing to an inter vivos trust by a bequest in the settlor's will is governed by the rule that applies to a testamentary trust, so that different rules apply to assets passing to an inter vivos trust depending upon whether they were transferred to the trust during the settlor's life or by his will.
      </p>
      <p>
       Having several different rules that apply to similar transactions is confusing.
    In order to simplify administration, Section 3342 applies the same rule to inter vivos trusts (revocable and irrevocable), testamentary trusts, and assets that become subject to an inter vivos trust by a testamentary bequest.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Periodic payments.
       </b>
       Under section 3342, a periodic payment is principal if it is due but unpaid before a decedent dies or before an asset becomes subject to a trust, but the next payment is allocated entirely to income and is not apportioned.
    Thus, periodic receipts such as rents, dividends, interest, and annuities, and disbursements such as the interest portion of a mortgage payment, are not apportioned.
    This is the original common law rule.
    Edwin A. Howes, Jr., The American Law Relating to Income and Principal 70 (1905).
    In trusts in which a surviving spouse is dependent upon a regular flow of cash from the decedent's securities portfolio, this rule will help to maintain payments to the spouse at the same level as before the settlor's death.
    Under the 1962 Act, the pre-death portion of the first periodic payment due after death is apportioned to principal in the case of a testamentary trust or securities bequeathed by will to an inter vivos trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Nonperiodic payments.
       </b>
       Under the second sentence of subsection 3342(b), interest on an obligation that does not provide a due date for the interest payment, such as interest on an income tax refund, would be apportioned to principal to the extent it accrues before a person dies or an income interest begins unless the obligation is specifically given to a devisee or remainder beneficiary, in which case all of the accrued interest passes under subdivision 3331(1) to the person who receives the obligation.
    The same rule applies to interest on an obligation that has a due date but does not provide for periodic payments.
    If there is no stated interest on the obligation, such as a zero coupon bond, and the proceeds from the obligation are received more than one year after it is purchased or acquired by the trustee, the entire amount received is principal under section 3356.

        Prior Acts.
       </b>
       Both the 1931 Act (Section 4) and the 1962 Act (Section 4(d)) provide that a deceased income beneficiary's estate is entitled to the undistributed income. The Drafting Committee concluded that this is probably not what most settlors would want, and that, with respect to undistributed income, most settlors would favor the income beneficiary first, the remainder beneficiaries second, and the income beneficiary's heirs last, if at all.
    However, it decided not to eliminate this provision to avoid causing disputes about whether the trustee should have distributed collected cash before the income beneficiary died.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Accrued periodic payments.
       </b>
       Under the prior Acts, an income beneficiary or his estate is entitled to receive a portion of any payments, other than dividends, that are due or that have accrued when the income interest terminates.
    The last sentence of subsection (a) changes that rule by providing that such items are not included in undistributed income.
    The items affected include periodic payments of interest, rent, and dividends, as well as items of income that accrue over a longer period of time; the rule also applies to expenses that are due or accrued.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Example; accrued periodic payments.
       </b>
       The rules in sections 3342 and Section 3343 work in the following manner: assume that a periodic payment of rent that is due on July 20 has not been paid when an income interest ends on July 30; the successive income interest begins on July 31, and the rent payment that was due on July 20 is paid on August 3.
    Under subsection 3342(a), the July 20 payment is added to the principal of the successive income interest when received. Under section 3342(b), the entire periodic payment of rent that is due on August 20 is income when received by the successive income interest.
    Under section 3343, neither the income beneficiary of the terminated income interest nor the beneficiary's estate is entitled to any part of either the July 20 or the August 20 payments because neither one was received before the income interest ended on July 30.
    The same principles apply to expenses of the trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Beneficiary with an unqualified power to revoke.
       </b>
       The requirement in subsection (b) to pay undistributed income to a mandatory income beneficiary or her estate does not apply to the extent the beneficiary has an unqualified power to revoke more than five percent of the trust immediately before the income interest ends.
    Without this exception, subsection (b) would apply to a revocable living trust whose settlor is the mandatory income beneficiary during her lifetime, even if her will provides that all of the assets in the probate estate are to be distributed to the trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a trust permits the beneficiary to withdraw all or a part of the trust principal after attaining a specified age and the beneficiary attains that age but fails to withdraw all of the principal that she is permitted to withdraw, a trustee is not required to pay her or her estate the undistributed income attributable to the portion of the principal that she left in the trust.
    The assumption underlying this rule is that the beneficiary has either provided for the disposition of the trust assets (including the undistributed income) by exercising a power of appointment that she has been given or has not withdrawn the assets because she is willing to have the principal and undistributed income be distributed under the terms of the trust.
    If the beneficiary has the power to withdraw 25% of the trust principal, the trustee must pay to her or her estate the undistributed income from the 75% that she cannot withdraw.

The reference to partnerships in subsection 3351(a) is intended to include all forms of partnerships, including limited partnerships, limited liability partnerships, and variants that have slightly different names and characteristics from State to State.
     The section does not apply, however, to receipts from an interest in property that a trust owns as a tenant in common with one or more co-owners, nor would it apply to an interest in a joint venture if, under applicable law, the trust's interest is regarded as that of a tenant in common.

        Capital gain dividends.
       </b>
       Under the Internal Revenue Code and the Income Tax Regulations, a "capital gain dividend" from a mutual fund or real estate investment trust is the excess of the fund's or trust's net long-term capital gain over its net short-term capital loss.
    As a result, a capital gain dividend does not include any net short-term capital gain, and cash received by a trust because of a net short-term capital gain is income under this Act.

        Reinvested dividends.
       </b>
       If a trustee elects (or continues an election made by its predecessor) to reinvest dividends in shares of stock of a distributing corporation or fund, whether evidenced by new certificates or entries on the books of the distributing entity, the new shares would be principal.
    Making or continuing such an election would be equivalent to deciding under section 3324 to transfer income to principal in order to comply with subsection 3323(b). However, if the trustee makes or continues the election for a reason other than to comply with subsection 3323(b), e.g., to make an investment without incurring brokerage commissions, the trustee should transfer cash from principal to income in an amount equal to the reinvested dividends.

        Distribution of property.
       </b>
       The 1962 Act describes a number of types of property that would be principal if distributed by a corporation.
    This becomes unwieldy in a section that applies to both corporations and all other entities.
    By stating that principal includes the distribution of any property other than money, section 3351 embraces all of the items enumerated in Section 6 of the 1962 Act as well as any other form of nonmonetary distribution not specifically mentioned in that Act.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Partial liquidations.
       </b>
       Under subsection (d)(1), any distribution designated by the entity as a partial liquidating distribution is principal regardless of the percentage of total assets that it represents.
    If a distribution exceeds 20% of the entity's gross assets, the entire distribution is a partial liquidation under subsection (d)(2) whether or not the entity describes it as a partial liquidation.
    In determining whether a distribution is greater than 20% of the gross assets, the portion of the distribution that does not exceed the amount of income tax that the trustee or a beneficiary must pay on the entity's taxable income is ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Other large distributions.
       </b>
       A cash distribution may be quite large (for example, more than 10% but not more than 20% of the entity's gross assets) and have characteristics that suggest it should be treated as principal rather than income. For example, an entity may have received cash from a source other than the conduct of its normal business operations because it sold an investment asset; or because it sold a business asset other than one held for sale to customers in the normal course of its business and did not replace it; or it borrowed a large sum of money and secured the repayment of the loan with a substantial asset; or a principal source of its cash was from assets such as mineral interests, 90% of which would have been allocated to principal if the trust had owned the assets directly.
    In such a case the trustee, after considering the total return from the portfolio as a whole and the income component of that return, may decide to exercise the power under subsection 3324(a) to make an adjustment between income and principal, subject to the limitations in subsection 3324(c).

        Terms of the distributing trust or estate.
       </b>
       Under subsection 3323(a), a trustee is to allocate receipts in accordance with the terms of the recipient trust or, if there is no provision, in accordance with this chapter.
    However, in determining whether a distribution from another trust or an estate is income or principal, the trustee should also determine what the terms of the distributing trust or estate say about the distribution; for example, whether they direct that the distribution, even though made from the income of the distributing trust or estate, is to be added to principal of the recipient trust.
    Such a provision should override the terms of this chapter, but if the terms of the recipient trust contain a provision requiring such a distribution to be allocated to income, the trustee may have to obtain a judicial resolution of the conflict between the terms of the two documents.

       <b>
        Purpose and scope.
       </b>
       The provisions in section 3353 are intended to give greater flexibility to a trustee who operates a business or other activity in proprietorship form rather than in a wholly-owned corporation (or, where permitted by state law, a single-member limited liability company), and to facilitate the trustee's ability to decide the extent to which the net receipts from the activity should be allocated to income, just as the board of directors of a corporation owned entirely by the trust would decide the amount of the annual dividend to be paid to the trust.
    It permits a trustee to account for farming or livestock operations, rental properties, oil and gas properties, timber operations, and activities in derivatives and options as though they were held by a separate entity.
    It is not intended, however, to permit a trustee to account separately for a traditional securities portfolio to avoid the provisions of this Act that apply to such securities.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 3353 permits the trustee to account separately for each business or activity for which the trustee determines separate accounting is appropriate.
    A trustee with a computerized accounting system may account for these activities in a "subtrust"; an individual trustee may continue to use the business and record-keeping methods employed by the decedent or transferor who may have conducted the business under an assumed name.
    The intent of this section is to give the trustee broad authority to select business record-keeping methods that best suit the activity in which the trustee is engaged.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a fiduciary liquidates a sole proprietorship or other activity to which section 3353 applies, the proceeds would be added to principal, even though derived from the liquidation of accounts receivable, because the proceeds would no longer be needed in the conduct of the business.
    If the liquidation occurs during probate or during an income interest's winding up period, none of the proceeds would be income for purposes of section 3331.
      </p>

       <b>
        Separate accounts.
       </b>
       A trustee may or may not maintain separate bank accounts for business activities that are accounted for under section 3353.
    A professional trustee may decide not to maintain separate bank accounts, but an individual trustee, especially one who has continued a decedent's business practices, may continue the same banking arrangements that were used during the decedent's lifetime. In either case, the trustee is authorized to decide to what extent cash is to be retained as part of the business assets and to what extent it is to be transferred to the trust's general accounts, either as income or principal.

      To the extent that a trustee accounts for receipts from rental property pursuant to this section, the trustee shall allocate to income an amount received as rent of real or personal property, including an amount received for cancellation or renewal of a lease. An amount received as a refundable deposit, including a security deposit or a deposit applied as rent for future periods, must be added to principal and held subject to the terms of the lease and is not available for distribution to a beneficiary until the trustee's contractual obligations have been satisfied with respect to that amount.

        Application of section 3353.
       </b>
       This section applies to the extent that the trustee does not account separately under section 3353 for the management of rental properties owned by the trust.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Receipts that are capital in nature.
       </b>
       A portion of the payment under a lease may be a reimbursement of principal expenditures for improvements to the leased property that is characterized as rent for purposes of invoking contractual or statutory remedies for nonpayment.
    If the trustee is accounting for rental income under section 3355, a transfer from income to reimburse principal may be appropriate under section 3371 to the extent that some of the "rent" is really a reimbursement for improvements.
    This set of facts could also be a relevant factor for a trustee to consider under subsection 3324(b) in deciding whether and to what extent to make an adjustment between principal and income under subsection 3324(a) after considering the return from the portfolio as a whole.

       </b>
       The reference in subsection (a) to variable or floating interest rate obligations is intended to clarify that, even though an obligation's interest rate may change from time to time based upon changes in an index or other market indicator, an obligation to pay money containing a variable or floating rate provision is subject to this section and is not to be treated as a derivative financial instrument under section 3364.

        Discount obligations.
       </b>
       Subsection (b) applies to all obligations acquired at a discount, including short-term obligations such as U.S. Treasury Bills, long-term obligations such as U.S. Savings Bonds, zero-coupon bonds, and discount bonds that pay interest during part, but not all, of the period before maturity.
    Under subsection (b), the entire increase in value of these obligations is principal when the trustee receives the proceeds from the disposition unless the obligation, when acquired, has a maturity of less than one year.
    In order to have one rule that applies to all discount obligations, the Act eliminates the provision in the 1962 Act for the payment from principal of an amount equal to the increase in the value of U.S. Series E bonds.
    The provision for bonds that mature within one year after acquisition by the trustee is derived from the Illinois act.
    760 ILCS 15/8 (1996).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (b) also applies to inflation-indexed bonds - any increase in principal due to inflation after issuance is principal upon redemption if the bond matures more than one year after the trustee acquires it; if it matures within one year, all of the increase, including any attributable to an inflation adjustment, is income.

        Effect of section 3324.

       In deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the power to adjust between principal and income granted by subsection 3324(a), a relevant factor for the trustee to consider is the effect on the portfolio as a whole of having a portion of the assets invested in bonds that do not pay interest currently.

       Comment
      </p>
      <p>
       This section is intended to relieve a trustee from making relatively small allocations while preserving the trustee's right to do so if an allocation is large in terms of absolute dollars.
      </p>
      <p>
       For example, assume that a trust's assets, which include a working interest in an oil well, have a value of $1,000,000; the net income from the assets other than the working interest is $40,000; and the net receipts from the working interest are $400.
    The trustee may allocate all of the net receipts from the working interest to principal instead of allocating 10%, or $40, to income under section 3361.
    If the net receipts from the working interest are $35,000, so that the amount allocated to income under section 3361 would be $3,500, the trustee may decide that this amount is sufficiently significant to the income beneficiary that the allocation provided for by section 3361 should be made, even though the trustee is still permitted under section 3358 to allocate all of the net receipts to principal because the $3,500 would increase the net income of $40,000, as determined before making an allocation under section 3361, by less than 10%. Section 3358 will also relieve a trustee from having to allocate net receipts from the sale of trees in a small woodlot between principal and income.
      </p>
      <p>
       While the allocation to principal of small amounts under this section should not be a cause for concern for tax purposes, allocations are not permitted under this section in circumstances described in subsection 3324(c) to eliminate claims that the power in this section has adverse tax consequences.

        Scope.
       </b>
       Section 3359 applies to amounts received under contractual arrangements that provide for payments to a third party beneficiary as a result of services rendered or property transferred to the payer.
    While the right to receive such payments is a liquidating asset of the kind described in section 3360 (i.e., "an asset whose value will diminish or terminate because the asset is expected to produce receipts for a period of limited duration"), these payment rights are covered separately in section 3359 because of their special characteristics.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 3359 applies to receipts from all forms of annuities and deferred compensation arrangements, whether the payment will be received by the trust in a lump sum or in installments over a period of years.
    It applies to bonuses that may be received over two or three years and payments that may last for much longer periods, including payments from an individual retirement account (IRA), deferred compensation plan (whether qualified or not qualified for special federal income tax treatment), and insurance renewal commissions.
    It applies to a retirement plan to which the settlor has made contributions, just as it applies to an annuity policy that the settlor may have purchased individually, and it applies to variable annuities, deferred annuities, annuities issued by commercial insurance companies, and "private annuities" arising from the sale of property to another individual or entity in exchange for payments that are to be made for the life of one or more individuals.
    The section applies whether the payments begin when the payment right becomes subject to the trust or are deferred until a future date, and it applies whether payments are made in cash or in kind, such as employer stock (in-kind payments usually will be made in a single distribution that will be allocated to principal under the second sentence of subsection (c)).

        The 1962 Act.
       </b>
       Under section 12 of the 1962 Act, receipts from "rights to receive payments on a contract for deferred compensation" are allocated to income each year in an amount "not in excess of 5% per year" of the property's inventory value.
    While "not in excess of 5%" suggests that the annual allocation may range from zero to 5% of the inventory value, in practice the rule is usually treated as prescribing a 5% allocation.
    The inventory value is usually the present value of all the future payments, and since the inventory value is determined as of the date on which the payment right becomes subject to the trust, the inventory value, and thus the amount of the annual income allocation, depends significantly on the applicable interest rate on the decedent's date of death.
    That rate may be much higher or lower than the average long-term interest rate.
    The amount determined under the 5% formula tends to become fixed and remain unchanged even though the amount received by the trust increases or decreases.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Allocations under subsection 3359(b).
       </b>
       Subsection 3359(b) applies to plans whose terms characterize payments made under the plan as dividends, interest, or payments in lieu of dividends or interest.
    For example, some deferred compensation plans that hold debt obligations or stock of the plan's sponsor in an account for future delivery to the person rendering the services provide for the annual payment to that person of dividends received on the stock or interest received on the debt obligations.
    Other plans provide that the account of the person rendering the services shall be credited with "phantom" shares of stock and require an annual payment that is equivalent to the dividends that would be received on that number of shares if they were actually issued; or a plan may entitle the person rendering the services to receive a fixed dollar amount in the future and provide for the annual payment of interest on the deferred amount during the period prior to its payment.
    Under subsection 3359(b), payments of dividends, interest or payments in lieu of dividends or interest under plans of this type are allocated to income; all other payments received under these plans are allocated to principal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection 3359(b) does not apply to an IRA or an arrangement with payment provisions similar to an IRA.
    IRAs and similar arrangements are subject to the provisions in subsection 3359(c).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Allocations under subsection 3359(c).
       </b>
       The focus of section 3359, for purposes of allocating payments received by a trust to or between principal and income, is on the payment right rather than on assets that may be held in a fund from which the payments are made.
    Thus, if an IRA holds a portfolio of marketable stocks and bonds, the amount received by the IRA as dividends and interest is not taken into account in determining the principal and income allocation except to the extent that the Internal Revenue Service may require them to be taken into account when the payment is received by a trust that qualifies for the estate tax marital deduction (a situation that is provided for in subsection 3359(d)).
    An IRA is subject to federal income tax rules that require payments to begin by a particular date and be made over a specific number of years or a period measured by the lives of one or more persons.
    The payment right of a trust that is named as a beneficiary of an IRA is not a right to receive particular items that are paid to the IRA, but is instead the right to receive an amount determined by dividing the value of the IRA by the remaining number of years in the payment period.
    This payment right is similar to the right to receive a unitrust amount, which is normally expressed as an amount equal to a percentage of the value of the unitrust assets without regard to dividends or interest that may be received by the unitrust.
      </p>
      <p>
       An amount received from an IRA or a plan with a payment provision similar to that of an IRA is allocated under subsection 3359(c), which differentiates between payments that are required to be made and all other payments.
    To the extent that a payment is required to be made (either under federal income tax rules or, in the case of a plan that is not subject to those rules, under the terms of the plan), 10% of the amount received is allocated to income and the balance is allocated to principal.
    All other payments are allocated to principal because they represent a change in the form of a principal asset; section 3359 follows the rule in subdivision 3354(2), which provides that money or property received from a change in the form of a principal asset be allocated to principal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection 3359(c) produces an allocation to income that is similar to the allocation under the 1962 Act formula if the annual payments are the same throughout the payment period, and it is simpler to administer.
    The amount allocated to income under section 3359 is not dependent upon the interest rate that is used for valuation purposes when the decedent dies, and if the payments received by the trust increase or decrease from year to year because the fund from which the payment is made increases or decreases in value, the amount allocated to income will also increase or decrease.

        Marital deduction requirements.
       </b>
       When an IRA or other retirement arrangement (a "plan") is payable to a marital deduction trust, the IRS treats the plan as a separate property interest that itself must qualify for the marital deduction.
    IRS Revenue Ruling 2006-26 said that, as written, section 3359 does not cause a trust to qualify for the IRS' safe harbors.
    Revenue Ruling 2006-26 was limited in scope to certain situations involving IRAs and defined contribution retirement plans.
    Without necessarily agreeing with the IRS' position in that ruling, the revision to this section is designed to satisfy the IRS' safe harbor and to address concerns that might be raised for similar assets.
    No IRS pronouncements have addressed the scope of Internal Revenue Code
       §
       2056(b)(7)(C).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (f) requires the trustee to demand certain distributions if the surviving spouse so requests.
    The safe harbor of Revenue Ruling 2006-26 requires that the surviving spouse be separately entitled to demand the fund's income (without regard to the income from the trust's other assets) and the income from the other assets (without regard to the fund's income).
    In any event, the surviving spouse is not required to demand that the trustee distribute all of the fund's income from the fund or from other trust assets. Treas. Reg.
       §
       20.2056(b)-5(f)(8).
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (f) also recognizes that the trustee might not control the payments that the trustee receives and provides a remedy to the surviving spouse if the distributions under subdivision (d)(1) are insufficient.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (g) addresses situations where, due to lack of information provided by the fund's administrator, the trustee is unable to determine the fund's actual income.
    The bracketed language is the range approved for unitrust payments by Treas. Reg.
       §
       1.643(b)-1.
    In determining the value for purposes of applying the unitrust percentage, the trustee would seek to obtain the value of the assets as of the most recent statement of value immediately preceding the beginning of the year.
    For example, suppose a trust's accounting period is January 1 through December 31.
    If a retirement plan administrator furnishes information annually each September 30 and declines to provide information as of December 31, then the trustee may rely on the September 30 value to determine the distribution for the following year.
    For funds whose values are not readily available, subsection (g) relies on Internal Revenue Code section 7520 valuation methods because many funds described in section 3359 are annuities, and one consistent set of valuation principles should apply whether or not the fund is, in fact, an annuity.

        Application of section 3324.
       </b>
       Subsection 3324(a) gives a trustee who is acting under the prudent investor rule the power to adjust from principal to income if, considering the portfolio as a whole and not just receipts from deferred compensation, the trustee determines that an adjustment is necessary.

        Prior Acts.
       </b>
       Section 11 of the 1962 Act allocates receipts from "property subject to depletion" to income in an amount "not in excess of 5%" of the asset's inventory value.
    The 1931 Act has a similar 5% rule that applies when the trustee is under a duty to change the form of the investment.
    The 5% rule imposes on a trust the obligation to pay a fixed annuity to the income beneficiary until the asset is exhausted.
    Under both the 1931 and 1962 Acts the balance of each year's receipts is added to principal.
    A fixed payment can produce unfair results.
    The remainder beneficiary receives all of the receipts from unexpected growth in the asset, e.g., if royalties on a patent or copyright increase significantly.
    Conversely, if the receipts diminish more rapidly than expected, most of the amount received by the trust will be allocated to income and little to principal. Moreover, if the annual payments remain the same for the life of the asset, the amount allocated to principal will usually be less than the original inventory value.
    For these reasons, section 3360 abandons the annuity approach under the 5% rule.

        Prior Acts.
       </b>
       The 1962 Act allocates to principal as a depletion allowance, 27-1/2% of the gross receipts, but not more than 50% of the net receipts after paying expenses.
    The Internal Revenue Code no longer provides for a 27-1/2% depletion allowance, although the major oil producing States have retained the 27-1/2% provision in their principal and income acts (Texas amended its Act in 1993, but did not change the depletion provision).
    Section 9 of the 1931 Act allocates all of the net proceeds received as consideration for the "permanent severance of natural resources from the lands" to principal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 3361 allocates 90% of the net receipts to principal and 10% to income.
    A depletion provision that is tied to past or present Code provisions is undesirable because it causes a large portion of the oil and gas receipts to be paid out as income.
    As wells are depleted, the amount received by the income beneficiary falls drastically.
    Allocating a larger portion of the receipts to principal enables the trustee to acquire other income producing assets that will continue to produce income when the mineral reserves are exhausted.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Application of sections 3353 and 3358.
       </b>
       This section applies to the extent that the trustee does not account separately for receipts from minerals and other natural resources under section 3353 or allocate all of the receipts to principal under section 3358.

        Open mine doctrine.
       </b>
       The purpose of subsection 3361(c) is to abolish the "open mine doctrine" as it may apply to the rights of an income beneficiary and a remainder beneficiary in receipts from the production of minerals from land owned or leased by a trust.
    Instead, such receipts are to be allocated to or between principal and income in accordance with the provisions of this Act.
    For a discussion of the open mine doctrine, see generally 3A Austin W. Scott & William F. Fratcher, The Law of Trusts
       §
       239.3 (4th ed. 1988), and
       Nutter v. Stockton,

      <p>
       <b>
        Effective date provision.
       </b>
       Section 9(b) of the 1962 Act provides that the natural resources provision does not apply to property interests held by the trust on the effective date of the Act, which reflects concerns about the constitutionality of applying a retroactive administrative provision to interests in real estate, based on the opinion in the Oklahoma case of
       Franklin v. Margay Oil Corporation,
       153 P.2d 486, 501 (Okla. 1944).
    Subsection 3361(d) permits a trustee to use either the method provided for in this Act or the method used before the Act takes effect. Lawyers in jurisdictions other than Oklahoma may conclude that retroactivity is not a problem as to property situated in their states, and this provision permits trustees to decide, based on advice from counsel in states whose law may be different from that of Oklahoma, whether they may apply this provision retroactively if they conclude that to do so is in the best interests of the beneficiaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       If the property is in a state other than the state where the trust is administered, the trustee must be aware that the law of the property's situs may control this question.
    The outcome turns on a variety of questions: whether the terms of the trust specify that the law of a state other than the situs of the property shall govern the administration of the trust, and whether the courts will follow the terms of the trust; whether the trust's asset is the land itself or a leasehold interest in the land (as it frequently is with oil and gas property); whether a leasehold interest or its proceeds should be classified as real property or personal property, and if as personal property, whether applicable state law treats it as a movable or an immovable for conflict of laws purposes.

       The rules in section 3362 are intended to apply to net receipts from the sale of trees and by-products from harvesting and processing trees without regard to the kind of trees that are cut or whether the trees are cut before or after a particular number of years of growth.
    The rules apply to the sale of trees that are expected to produce lumber for building purposes, trees sold as pulpwood, and Christmas and other ornamental trees. Subsection (a) applies to net receipts from property owned by the trustee and property leased by the trustee.
    The Act is not intended to prevent a tenant in possession of the property from using wood that he cuts on the property for personal, noncommercial purposes, such as a Christmas tree, firewood, mending old fences or building new fences, or making repairs to structures on the property.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under subsection (a), the amount of net receipts allocated to income depends upon whether the amount of timber removed is more or less than the rate of growth.
    The method of determining the amount of timber removed and the rate of growth is up to the trustee, based on methods customarily used for the kind of timber involved.

        Application of sections 3353 and 3368.
       </b>
       This section applies to the extent that the trustee does not account separately for net receipts from the sale of timber and related products under section 3353 or allocate all of the receipts to principal under section 3368.
    The option to account for net receipts separately under section 3353 takes into consideration the possibility that timber harvesting operations may have been conducted before the timber property became subject to the trust, and that it may make sense to continue using accounting methods previously established for the property.
    It also permits a trustee to use customary accounting practices for timber operations even if no harvesting occurred on the property before it became subject to the trust.

        Prior Acts' Conflict with uniform Prudent Investor Act.
       </b>
       Section 2(b) of the Uniform Prudent Investor Act provides that "[a] trustee's investment and management decisions respecting individual assets must be evaluated not in isolation but in the context of the trust portfolio as a whole . . .
    ."
    The underproductive property provisions in Section 12 of the 1962 Act and Section 11 of the 1931 Act give the income beneficiary a right to receive a portion of the proceeds from the sale of underproductive property as "delayed income."
    In each Act the provision applies on an asset by asset basis and not by taking into consideration the trust portfolio as a whole, which conflicts with the basic precept in Section 2(b) of the Prudent Investor Act. Moreover, in determining the amount of delayed income, the prior Acts do not permit a trustee to take into account the extent to which the trustee may have distributed principal to the income beneficiary, under principal invasion provisions in the terms of the trust, to compensate for insufficient income from the unproductive asset.
    Under subdivision 3324(b)(7) of this Act, a trustee must consider prior distributions of principal to the income beneficiary in deciding whether and to what extent to exercise the power to adjust conferred by subsection 3324(a).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Duty to make property productive of income.
       </b>
       In order to implement the Uniform Prudent Investor Act, this Act abolishes the right to receive delayed income from the sale proceeds of an asset that produces little or no income, but it does not alter existing state law regarding the income beneficiary's right to compel the trustee to make property productive of income.
    As the law continues to develop in this area, the duty to make property productive of current income in a particular situation should be determined by taking into consideration the performance of the portfolio as a whole and the extent to which a trustee makes principal distributions to the income beneficiary under the terms of the trust and adjustments between principal and income under section 3324.
      </p>
      <p>
       Trusts for which the value of the right to receive income is important for tax reasons may be affected by Treas. Reg.

      </p>
      <p>
       Once the two conditions have occurred - insufficient beneficial enjoyment from the property and the spouse's demand that the trustee take action under this section - the trustee must act; but instead of the formulaic approach of the 1962 Act, which is triggered only if the trustee sells the property, this Act permits the trustee to decide whether to make the property productive of income, convert it, transfer funds from principal to income, or to take some combination of those actions.
    The trustee may rely on the power conferred by subsection 3324(a) to adjust from principal to income if the trustee decides that it is not feasible or appropriate to make the property productive of income or to convert the property. Given the purpose of section 3363, the power under subsection 3324(a) would be exercised to transfer principal to income and not to transfer income to principal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Section 3363 does not apply to a so-called "estate" trust, which will qualify for the marital deduction, even though the income may be accumulated for a term of years or for the life of the surviving spouse, if the terms of the trust require the principal and undistributed income to be paid to the surviving spouse's estate when the spouse dies.

        Scope and application.
       </b>
       It is difficult to predict how frequently and to what extent trustees will invest directly in derivative financial instruments rather than participating indirectly through investment entities that may utilize these instruments in varying degrees.
    If the trust participates in derivatives indirectly through an entity, an amount received from the entity will be allocated under section 3351 and not section 3364.
    If a trustee invests directly in derivatives to a significant extent, the expectation is that receipts and disbursements related to derivatives will be accounted for under section 3353; if a trustee chooses not to account under section 3353, subsection 3364(b) provides the default rule. Certain types of option transactions in which trustees may engage are dealt with in subsection (c) to distinguish those transactions from ones involving options that are embedded in derivative financial instruments.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Definition of "derivative".
       </b>
       "Derivative" is a difficult term to define because new derivatives are invented daily as dealers tailor their terms to achieve specific financial objectives for particular clients.
    Since derivatives are typically contract-based, a derivative can probably be devised for almost any set of objectives if another party can be found who is willing to assume the obligations required to meet those objectives.
      </p>
      <p>
       The most comprehensive definition of derivative is in the Exposure Draft of a Proposed Statement of Financial Accounting Standards titled "Accounting for Derivative and Similar Financial Instruments and for Hedging Activities," which was released by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) on June 20, 1996 (No. 162-B).
    The definition in subsection 3364(a) is derived in part from the FASB definition.
    The purpose of the definition in subsection (a) is to implement the substantive rule in subsection (b) that provides for all receipts and disbursements to be allocated to principal to the extent the trustee elects not to account for transactions in derivatives under section 3353.
    As a result, it is much shorter than the FASB definition, which serves much more ambitious objectives.
      </p>
      <p>
       A derivative is frequently described as including futures, forwards, swaps and options, terms that also require definition, and the definition in this Act avoids these terms.
    FASB used the same approach, explaining in paragraph 65 of the Exposure Draft:
      </p>
      <p>
       The definition of
       derivative financial instrument
       in this Statement includes those financial instruments generally considered to be derivatives, such as forwards, futures, swaps, options, and similar instruments.
    The Board considered defining a derivative financial instrument by merely referencing those commonly understood instruments, similar to paragraph 5 of Statement 119, which says that ". . . a derivative financial instrument is a futures, forward, swap, or option contract, or other financial instrument with similar characteristics."
    However, the continued development of financial markets and innovative financial instruments could ultimately render a definition based on examples inadequate and obsolete.
    The Board, therefore, decided to base the definition of a derivative financial instrument on a description of the common characteristics of those instruments in order to accommodate the accounting for newly developed derivatives.
    (Footnote omitted.)
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Marking to market.
       </b>
       A gain or loss that occurs because the trustee marks securities to market or to another value during an accounting period is not a transaction in a derivative financial instrument that is income or principal under the Act - only cash receipts and disbursements, and the receipt of property in exchange for a principal asset, affect a trust's principal and income accounts.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Receipt of property other than cash.
       </b>
       If a trustee receives property other than cash upon the settlement of a derivatives transaction, that property would be principal under subdivision 3354(2).
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Options.
       </b>
       Options to which subsection (c) applies include an option to purchase real estate owned by the trustee and a put option purchased by a trustee to guard against a drop in value of a large block of marketable stock that must be liquidated to pay estate taxes.
    Subsection (c) would also apply to a continuing and regular practice of selling call options on securities owned by the trust if the terms of the option require delivery of the securities.
    It does not apply if the consideration received or given for the option is something other than cash or property, such as cross-options granted in a buy-sell agreement between owners of an entity.

        Scope of section.
       </b>
       Typical asset-backed securities include arrangements in which debt obligations such as real estate mortgages, credit card receivables and auto loans are acquired by an investment trust and interests in the trust are sold to investors.
    The source for payments to an investor is the money received from principal and interest payments on the underlying debt.
    An asset-backed security includes an "interest only" or a "principal only" security that permits the investor to receive only the interest payments received from the bonds, mortgages or other assets that are the collateral for the asset-backed security, or only the principal payments made on those collateral assets.
    An asset-backed security also includes a security that permits the investor to participate in either the capital appreciation of an underlying security or in the interest or dividend return from such a security, such as the "Primes" and "Scores" issued by Americus Trust.
    An asset-backed security does not include an interest in a corporation, partnership, or an investment trust described in the comment to section 3352, whose assets consist significantly or entirely of investment assets.
    Receipts from an instrument that do not come within the scope of this section or any other section of the Act would be allocated entirely to principal under the rule in subdivision 3323(a)(4), and the trustee may then consider whether and to what extent to exercise the power to adjust in section 3324, taking into account the return from the portfolio as whole and other relevant factors.

        Environmental expenses.
       </b>
       All environmental expenses are payable from principal, subject to the power of the trustee to transfer funds to principal from income under section 3374. However, the Drafting Committee decided that it was not necessary to broaden this provision to cover other expenditures made under compulsion of governmental authority. See generally the annotation at 43 A.L.R.4th 1012 (Duty as Between Life Tenant and Remainderman with Respect to Cost of Improvements or Repairs Made Under Compulsion of Governmental Authority).
      </p>
      <p>
       Environmental expenses paid by a trust are to be paid from principal under subdivision 3372(a)(7) on the assumption that they will usually be extraordinary in nature.
    Environmental expenses might be paid from income if the trustee is carrying on a business that uses or sells toxic substances, in which case environmental cleanup costs would be a normal cost of doing business and would be accounted for under section 3353. In accounting under that section, environmental costs will be a factor in determining how much of the net receipts from the business is trust income.
    Paying all other environmental expenses from principal is consistent with this Act's approach regarding receipts - when a receipt is not clearly a current return on a principal asset, it should be added to principal because over time both the income and remainder beneficiaries benefit from this treatment.
    Here, allocating payments required by environmental laws to principal imposes the detriment of those payments over time on both the income and remainder beneficiaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       Under subsections 3374(a) and subdivision 3374(b)(5), a trustee who makes or expects to make a principal disbursement for an environmental expense described in subdivision 3372(a)(7) is authorized to transfer an appropriate amount from income to principal to reimburse principal for disbursements made or to provide a reserve for future principal disbursements.
      </p>
      <p>
       The first part of subdivision 3372(a)(7) is based upon the definition of an "environmental remediation trust" in Treas. Reg.
       §
       301.7701-4(e) (as amended in 1996).
    This is not because the Act applies to an environmental remediation trust, but because the definition is a useful and thoroughly vetted description of the kinds of expenses that a trustee owning contaminated property might incur.
    Expenses incurred to comply with environmental laws include the cost of environmental consultants, administrative proceedings and burdens of every kind imposed as the result of an administrative or judicial proceeding, even though the burden is not formally characterized as a penalty.

       </b>
       The 1931 Act has no provision for depreciation.
    Section 13(a)(2) of the 1962 Act provides that a charge shall be made against income for "... a reasonable allowance for depreciation on property subject to depreciation under generally accepted accounting principles ... ."
    That provision has been resisted by many trustees, who do not provide for any depreciation for a variety of reasons.
    One reason relied upon is that a charge for depreciation is not needed to protect the remainder beneficiaries if the value of the land is increasing; another is that generally accepted accounting principles may not require depreciation to be taken if the property is not part of a business.
    The Drafting Committee concluded that the decision to provide for depreciation should be discretionary with the trustee.
    The power to transfer funds from income to principal that is granted by this section is a discretionary power of administration referred to in subsection 3323(b), and in exercising the power a trustee must comply with subsection 3323(b).
      </p>
      <p>
       One purpose served by transferring cash from income to principal for depreciation is to provide funds to pay the principal of an indebtedness secured by the depreciable property.
    Subdivision 3374(b)(4) permits the trustee to transfer additional cash from income to principal for this purpose to the extent that the amount transferred from income to principal for depreciation is less than the amount of the principal payments.

       The sources of section 3374 are Section 13(b) of the 1962 Act, which permits a trustee to "regularize distributions," if charges against income are unusually large, by using "reserves or other reasonable means" to withhold sums from income distributions;
    Section 13(c)(3) of the 1962 Act, which authorizes a trustee to establish an allowance for depreciation out of income if principal is used for extraordinary repairs, capital improvements and special assessments; and Section 12(3) of the 1931 Act, which permits the trustee to spread income expenses of unusual amount "throughout a series of years."
    Section 3374 contains a more detailed enumeration of the circumstances in which this authority may be used, and includes in subdivision (b)(4) the express authority to use income to make principal payments on a mortgage if the depreciation charge against income is less than the principal payments on the mortgage.

        Taxes on undistributed entity taxable income.
       </b>
       When a trust owns an interest in a pass-through entity, such as a partnership or S corporation, it must report its share of the entity's taxable income regardless of how much the entity distributes to the trust. Whether the entity distributes more or less than the trust's tax on its share of the entity's taxable income, the trust must pay the taxes and allocate them between income and principal.
      </p>
      <p>
       Subsection (c) requires the trust to pay the taxes on its share of an entity's taxable income from income or principal receipts to the extent that receipts from the entity are allocable to each. This assures the trust a source of cash to pay some or all of the taxes on its share of the entity's taxable income. Subsection (d) recognizes that, except in the case of an Electing Small Business Trust (ESBT), a trust normally receives a deduction for amounts distributed to a beneficiary. Accordingly, subsection (d) requires the trust to increase receipts payable to a beneficiary as determined under subsection (c) to the extent the trust's taxes are reduced by distributing those receipts to the beneficiary.
      </p>
      <p>
       Because the trust's taxes and amounts distributed to a beneficiary are interrelated, the trust may be required to apply a formula to determine the correct amount payable to a beneficiary. This formula should take into account that each time a distribution is made to a beneficiary, the trust taxes are reduced and amounts distributable to a beneficiary are increased. The formula assures that after deducting distributions to a beneficiary, the trust has enough to satisfy its taxes on its share of the entity's taxable income as reduced by distributions to beneficiaries.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Example (1)
       </b>
       - Trust T receives a Schedule K-1 from Partnership P reflecting taxable income of $1 million. Partnership P distributes $100,000 to T, which allocates the receipts to income. Both Trust T and income Beneficiary B are in the 35 percent tax bracket. Trust T's tax on $1 million of taxable income is $350,000. Under subsection (c), T's tax must be paid from income receipts because receipts from the entity are allocated only to income. Therefore, T must apply the entire $100,000 of income receipts to pay its tax. In this case, Beneficiary B receives nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
       <b>
        Example (2)
       </b>
       - Trust T receives a Schedule K-1 from Partnership P reflecting taxable income of $1 million. Partnership P distributes $500,000 to T, which allocates the receipts to income. Both Trust T and income Beneficiary B are in the 35 percent tax bracket. Trust T's tax on $1 million of taxable income is $350,000. Under subsection (c), T's tax must be paid from income receipts because receipts from P are allocated only to income. Therefore, T uses $350,000 of the $500,000 to pay its taxes and distributes the remaining $150,000 to B. The $150,000 payment to B reduces T's taxes by $52,500, which it must pay to B. But the $52,500 further reduces T's taxes by $18,375, which it also must pay to B. In fact, each time T makes a distribution to B, its taxes are further reduced, causing another payment to be due B.
      </p>
      <p>
       Alternatively, T can apply the following algebraic formula to determine the amount payable to B:
      </p>
      <p>
       D =(C-R*K)/(1-R)
      </p>
      <p>
       D = Distribution to income beneficiary
      </p>
      <p>
       C = Cash paid by the entity to the trust
      </p>
      <p>
       R = tax rate on income
      </p>
      <p>
       K = entity's K-1 taxable income
      </p>
      <p>
       Applying the formula to Example (2) above, Trust T must pay $230,769 to B so that after deducting the payment, T has exactly enough to pay its tax on the remaining taxable income from P.
      </p>
      <p>
       Taxable Income per K-1 1,000, 000

      <p>

      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
       Payable to the Beneficiary 230,769
      </p>
      <p>
       In addition, B will report $230,769 on his or her own personal income tax return, paying taxes of $80,769. Because Trust T withheld $269,231 to pay its taxes and B paid $80,769 taxes of its own, B bore the entire $350,000 tax burden on the $1 million of entity taxable income, including the $500,000 that the entity retained that presumably increased the value of the trust's investment entity.
      </p>
      <p>
       If a trustee determines that it is appropriate to so, it should consider exercising the discretion granted in section 3376 to adjust between income and principal. Alternatively, the trustee may exercise the power to adjust under section 3324 to the extent it is available and appropriate under the circumstances, including whether a future distribution from the entity that would be allocated to principal should be reallocated to income because the income beneficiary already bore the burden of taxes on the reinvested income. In exercising the power, the trust should consider the impact that future distributions will have on any current adjustments.

        Discretionary adjustments.
       </b>
       Subsection 3376(a) permits the fiduciary to make adjustments between income and principal because of tax law provisions.
    It would permit discretionary adjustments in situations like these:
    (1) A fiduciary elects to deduct administration expenses that are paid from principal on an income tax return instead of on the estate tax return; (2) a distribution of a principal asset to a trust or other beneficiary causes the taxable income of an estate or trust to be carried out to the distributee and relieves the persons who receive the income of any obligation to pay income tax on the income; or (3) a trustee realizes a capital gain on the sale of a principal asset and pays a large state income tax on the gain, but under applicable federal income tax rules the trustee may not deduct the state income tax payment from the capital gain in calculating the trust's federal capital gain tax, and the income beneficiary receives the benefit of the deduction for state income tax paid on the capital gain.
    See generally Joel C. Dobris, Limits on the Doctrine of Equitable Adjustment in Sophisticated Postmortem Tax Planning, 66 Iowa L. Rev. 273 (1981).

       Subdivision 3376(a)(3) applies to a qualified Subchapter S trust (QSST) whose income beneficiary is required to include a pro rata share of the S corporation's taxable income in his return.
    If the QSST does not receive a cash distribution from the corporation that is large enough to cover the income beneficiary's tax liability, the trustee may distribute additional cash from principal to the income beneficiary.
    In this case the retention of cash by the corporation benefits the trust principal.
    This situation could occur if the corporation's taxable income includes capital gain from the sale of a business asset and the sale proceeds are reinvested in the business instead of being distributed to shareholders.

        Mandatory adjustment.
       </b>
       Subsection (b) provides for a mandatory adjustment from income to principal to the extent needed to preserve an estate tax marital deduction or charitable contributions deduction.
    It is derived from New York's EPTL
       §
       11-1.2(A), which requires principal to be reimbursed by those who benefit when a fiduciary elects to deduct administration expenses on an income tax return instead of the estate tax return.
    Unlike the New York provision, subsection (b) limits a mandatory reimbursement to cases in which a marital deduction or a charitable contributions deduction is reduced by the payment of additional estate taxes because of the fiduciary's income tax election.
    It is intended to preserve the result reached in
       Estate of Britenstool v. Commissioner,
       46 T.C. 711 (1966), in which the Tax Court held that a reimbursement required by the predecessor of EPTL
       <span class="s1">
        §
       </span>
       11-1.2(A) resulted in the estate receiving the same charitable contributions deduction it would have received if the administration expenses had been deducted for estate tax purposes instead of for income tax purposes. Because a fiduciary will elect to deduct administration expenses for income tax purposes only when the income tax reduction exceeds the estate tax reduction, the effect of this adjustment is that the principal is placed in the same position it would have occupied if the fiduciary had deducted the expenses for estate tax purposes, but the income beneficiaries receive an additional benefit.
    For example, if the income tax benefit from the deduction is $30,000 and the estate tax benefit would have been $20,000, principal will be reimbursed $20,000 and the net benefit to the income beneficiaries will be $10,000.

        Irrevocable grantor trusts.
       </b>
       Under sections 671-679 of the Internal Revenue Code (the "grantor trust" provisions), a person who creates an irrevocable trust for the benefit of another person may be subject to tax on the trust's income or capital gains, or both, even though the settlor is not entitled to receive any income or principal from the trust. Because this is now a well-known tax result, many trusts have been created to produce this result, but there are also trusts that are unintentionally subject to this rule.
    The Act does not require or authorize a trustee to distribute funds from the trust to the settlor in these cases because it is difficult to establish a rule that applies only to trusts where this tax result is unintended and does not apply to trusts where the tax result is intended.
    Settlors who intend this tax result rarely state it as an objective in the terms of the trust, but instead rely on the operation of the tax law to produce the desired result.
    As a result it may not be possible to determine from the terms of the trust if the result was intentional or unintentional.
    If the drafter of such a trust wants the trustee to have the authority to distribute principal or income to the settlor to reimburse the settlor for taxes paid on the trust's income or capital gains, such a provision should be placed in the terms of the trust. In some situations the Internal Revenue Service may require that such a provision be placed in the terms of the trust as a condition to issuing a private letter ruling.

        Power of attorney (POA) granting the attorney-in-fact authority to make transfers in his father's stead was created prior to the effective date of the amended POA statute; however, he exercised the term providing him power of transfer after the effective date. The term providing the power to transfer did not give him the explicit power to make gifts, as required by the amended POA statute, and thus an attempt to exercise authority pursuant to that term after the statute's effective date was void and unenforceable.

       On motion filed in connection with a petition for appointment of an involuntary guardian or on petition of a guardian if one has been appointed, the Probate Division of the Superior Court shall consider whether the authority of an agent designated pursuant to a previously executed power of attorney should continue undisturbed or be limited, suspended or terminated. The court may issue an order limiting, suspending or terminating the power of attorney only upon determining that to do so would be in the best interests of the ward.

       Upon a finding by a Probate Division of the Superior Court that appointment of a guardian is warranted, pursuant to a petition for involuntary guardianship under subchapter 12 of chapter 111 of this title, if the principal has nominated a guardian in a previously executed power of attorney or other document, the Probate Division of the Superior Court shall appoint as guardian the person so nominated unless the court determines that to do so would not be in the best interests of the ward.

       In determining the best interests of the ward, the court shall consider, at a minimum, the following factors:

         the preferences of the ward, including the identity of the agent and the scope of the agent's authority, as expressed in the power of attorney;

        <li id="t14p04c123s3509ol1c6">
         whether the agent has violated the provisions of this subchapter or the terms of the power of attorney, breached his or her fiduciary duty, failed to perform duties under the power, or is unable or unwilling to perform duties under the power of attorney;

        Reading in their entirety the first two subsections of the statute entitled "Provisions of statute implied," it appears that even for a power of attorney (POA) created prior to the effective date of the statute, any exercise of authority under that POA which occurs after the statute's effective date must conform with the entire statute or the execution is invalid.

       <p>
        Power of attorney (POA) granting the attorney-in-fact authority to make transfers in his father's stead was created prior to the effective date of the amended POA statute; however, he exercised the term providing him power of transfer after the effective date. The term providing the power to transfer did not give him the explicit power to make gifts, as required by the amended POA statute, and thus an attempt to exercise authority pursuant to that term after the statute's effective date was void and unenforceable.
