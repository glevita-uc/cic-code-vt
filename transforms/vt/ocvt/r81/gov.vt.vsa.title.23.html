The changes that each of the amendments made are described in the amendment notes set out below.

        The term "operator," as used in section 1133 of this title, means the person operating the motor vehicle; limiting the term "operator" in section 1133 to the definition supplied in subdiv.

        Language "propelled or drawn by power other than muscular power," found in the statute defining a "motor vehicle," is plain and unambiguous. A boom lift is powered by a motor rather than muscular power; therefore, it falls within this express definition of a motor vehicle. State v. Smith, 190 Vt. 222, 27 A.3d 362 (2011).

       </p>
       <p>
        Owner of taxicab which is a jitney, as defined by this section, is common carrier and assumes all obligations incident to that calling; i.e., he is bound to exercise the utmost care that no injury befall his passengers and the law requires of him the highest degree of care respecting his equipment.

       <p>
        In prosecution for operating unregistered motor vehicle, where automobile descended hill solely by reason of its own weight and the law of gravitation, the automobile then being incapable of operating under its own power, such acts constituted operation of motor vehicle within the meaning of this section.

        Defendant's private driveway, which was not restricted in any way, was a public highway under 23 V.S.A.
        §
        4(13) for purposes of Vermont's DUI statute. State v. Eckhardt, 165 Vt. 606, 686 A.2d 104 (mem.) (1996).

       <p>
        Defendant was not in control of her vehicle "on a highway" within 23 V.S.A.

        <span class="s1">
         §

        1201(a)(2) because the taxi cab parking lot where defendant was found was used by employees to leave their cars, the taxicabs used in the business, and persons specifically invited to enter; to the public generally, the message was "no trespassing," a message enforced by requests for police assistance. State v. McNeil, 164 Vt. 129, 665 A.2d 51 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court's rationale could have been adopted by the Legislature to prohibit driving or control of a vehicle while intoxicated wherever it occurs, but by including as an element of the offense that the operation or control occur on a "highway" and defining the term as it did, the Legislature opted for a more narrow approach. State v. McNeil, 164 Vt. 129, 665 A.2d 51 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence that road where defendant drove while under the influence of intoxicating liquor was maintained and plowed by town and provided secondary access to store and school supported trial court's finding that road was open to general circulation of public and, therefore, a highway, even though road was privately owned and "no trespassing" and "private drive" signs indicated exclusion of public. State v. Paquette, 151 Vt. 631, 563 A.2d 632 (1989).

        The breakdown lane of an interstate highway comes within the meaning of the term "highway." State v. Bailey, 149 Vt. 528, 546 A.2d 786 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence that road on which defendant was travelling was an interstate highway, and that a number of vehicles were travelling on the same roadway at the time of the offense, was sufficient to allow jury to conclude that road was a highway within the meaning of subdiv.

        In the case of defendant convicted of being in actual physical control of a motor vehicle upon a public highway while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, subdiv. (13) of this section did not require a showing that defendant's vehicle was on "a way laid out under authority of law." State v. Trucott, 145 Vt. 274, 487 A.2d 149 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where police officer testified that the area where the vehicle was parked was on the "side of the highway, approximately 12 to 15 feet wide right along side, parallel to the highway," that it was immediately adjacent to the highway and "used as a pull-off area" and, in charging the jury on the highway element of the offense, the court pointed out that the key was not ownership of the highway but whether it was open to the general public, the evidence was sufficient to establish that the vehicle was on a public highway and the charge was proper. State v. Trucott, 145 Vt. 274, 487 A.2d 149 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the case of defendant convicted of operating a motor vehicle on a highway while under the influence of intoxicating liquor and of operating a motor vehicle on a public highway while his license or right to so operate was under suspension where both offenses were alleged to have occurred in a restaurant parking lot, since there was evidence that the restaurant was located on a highway, that three cars at one time could drive in the wide entrance of its parking lot from the highway, that the driveway entrance was fifteen to twenty feet long before it opened into the parking lot and that the parking lot itself accommodated six or seven rows of cars, the parking lot was open to the general circulation of the public and therefore constituted a public highway under subdiv. (13) of this section. State v. Jarvis, 145 Vt. 8, 482 A.2d 65 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        As a place "open temporarily or permanently to public or general circulation of vehicles," the frozen surface of lake qualified as a public road. Bourgon v. Farm Bureau Mutual Insurance Co., 128 Vt. 593, 270 A.2d 151 (1970).

       <p>
        Roadways within state forest park fall within definition of "public highways" in this section. 1952-54 Op. Atty. Gen. 235.
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the words "or other place" in the definition of public highway are followed by other words clearly indicating the character and extent of the similarity which such place must bear to the places previously enumerated, the rule of ejusdem generis does not apply. State v. Hallock, 114 Vt. 292, 44 A.2d 326 (1945).

        Frozen surface of Lake Champlain is within the meaning of "or other place" as used in the definition of public highway in this section. State v. Hallock, 114 Vt. 292, 44 A.2d 326 (1945).

       </h5>
       <p>
        The classification of "highway building equipment" in subdiv. (19) of this section applies only when such equipment is used exclusively for the building, repair, or maintenance of highways. 1966-68 Op. Atty. Gen. 132.

         9. Fresh pursuit.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Police officer had authority to stop and arrest defendant outside of officer's jurisdiction, based on doctrine of fresh pursuit, where defendant's erratic driving was first observed in the jurisdiction, although it was not until the officer and defendant left the jurisdiction that defendant accelerated his vehicle and probable cause existed for a stop; it was not required that probable cause exist before the officer left the jurisdiction. State v. Griffin, 152 Vt. 309, 565 A.2d 1340 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        In light of the presumption that all language is inserted in a statute advisedly and the Supreme Court's obligation to give effect to every word, clause ejusdem generis and sentence of a statute if it is possible to do so, the Court would not discard statutory language "as used in this chapter" in the definition of fresh pursuit in subdiv. (12) as inadvertent or as mere surplusage since it is not necessary to do so in order to effectuate the intent of the Legislature. State v. Baldwin, 140 Vt. 501, 438 A.2d 1135 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since the definition of fresh pursuit applies to all the statutes relating to motor vehicles and to the enforcement of the laws regulating motor vehicles unless the context of the statutes compel otherwise, trial court properly denied a motion to suppress evidence where the motion was based upon an assumption that a police officer from one town had no authority under the doctrine of fresh pursuit to follow the defendant from that town to a neighboring city and stop him in that jurisdiction. State v. Baldwin, 140 Vt. 501, 438 A.2d 1135 (1981).

        Because of his experience with older model Jeeps, which provided him with some knowledge of the way they sounded when running in good condition, a trooper had a reasonable basis for believing that the muffler on defendant's Jeep was not in working order and his stop of the vehicle was justified.

       The Commissioner may authorize background investigations for potential employees, which may include criminal, traffic, and financial records checks; provided, however, that the potential employee is notified and has the right to withdraw his or her name from application. Additionally, employees who are involved in the manufacturing or production of operator's licenses and identification cards, including enhanced licenses, or who have the ability to affect the identity information that appears on a license or identification card, or current employees who will be assigned to such positions, shall be subject to appropriate background checks and shall be provided notice of the background check and the contents of that check. These background checks shall include a name-based and fingerprint-based criminal history records check using at a minimum the Federal Bureau of Investigation's National Crime Information Center and the Integrated Automated Fingerprint Identification database and State repository records on each covered employee. Employees may be subject to further appropriate security clearances if required by federal law, including background investigations that may include criminal and traffic records checks and providing proof of U.S. citizenship. The Commissioner may, in connection with a formal disciplinary investigation, authorize a criminal or traffic record background investigation of a current employee; provided, however, that the background review is relevant to the issue under disciplinary investigation. Information acquired through the investigation shall be provided to the Commissioner or designated division director and must be maintained in a secure manner. If the information acquired is used as a basis for any disciplinary action, it must be given to the employee during any pretermination hearing or contractual grievance hearing to allow the employee an opportunity to respond to or dispute the information. If no disciplinary action is taken against the employee, the information acquired through the background check shall be destroyed.

       <p>
        The suspension of an operator's license for payment of a Motor Vehicle Department fee by a bad check is a civil penalty and as such is regulatory in nature rather than punitive and is constitutionally valid. Bauer v. Malloy, 135 Vt. 175, 376 A.2d 17 (1977).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where notice of suspension of motor vehicle operator's license did not give any indication of operator's right to a hearing, and operator failed to request a hearing, even though the guarantees of hearing apply to suspension of an operator's license pursuant to this section, operator could not claim that his rights were infringed in view of agreed statement of facts and his admission that he did utter a bad check in payment of license; however, better procedure would be that notice contain reference indicating opportunity for hearing upon request. Bauer v. Malloy, 135 Vt. 175, 376 A.2d 17 (1977).

       Any Vermont resident may make application to the Commissioner and be issued an identification card that is attested by the Commissioner as to true name, correct age, residential address unless the listing of another address is requested by the applicant or is otherwise authorized by law, and any other identifying data as the Commissioner may require that shall include, in the case of minor applicants, the written consent of the applicant's parent, guardian, or other person standing in loco parentis. Every application for an identification card shall be signed by the applicant and shall contain such evidence of age and identity as the Commissioner may require, consistent with subsection (
    
     l
    
    ) of this section. New and renewal application forms shall include a space for the applicant to request that a "veteran" designation by placed on his or her identification card. If a veteran, as defined in 38 U.S.C. § 101(2), requests a veteran designation and provides a Department of Defense Form 214 or other proof of veteran status specified by the Commissioner, and the Office of Veterans Affairs confirms his or her status as an honorably discharged veteran or a veteran discharged under honorable conditions, the identification card shall include the term "veteran" on its face. The Commissioner shall require payment of a fee of $24.00 at the time application for an identification card is made, except that an initial nondriver identification card shall be issued at no charge to an individual who surrenders his or her license in connection with a suspension or revocation under subsection 636(b) of this title due to a physical or mental condition.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c03s115ol1b">
       Every identification card shall expire, unless earlier canceled, at midnight on the eve of the fourth anniversary of the date of birth of the cardholder following the date of original issue, and may be renewed every four years upon payment of a $24.00 fee. A renewed identification card shall expire, unless earlier canceled, at midnight on the eve of the fourth anniversary of the date of birth of the cardholder following the expiration of the card being renewed. At least 30 days before an identification card will expire, the Commissioner shall mail first-class to the cardholder or send the cardholder electronically an application to renew the identification card; a cardholder shall be sent the renewal notice by mail unless the cardholder opts in to receive electronic notification. An individual born on February 29 shall, for the purposes of this section, be considered as born on March 1.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c03s115ol1c">
       In the event an identification card is lost, destroyed, mutilated, or a new name is acquired, a replacement may be obtained upon furnishing satisfactory proof to the Commissioner and paying a $20.00 fee.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c03s115ol1d">

       The Commissioner shall cancel the identification card if the card is fraudulently obtained, altered, or misused.

       An identification card issued to a first-time applicant and any subsequent renewals by that person shall contain a photograph or imaged likeness of the applicant. The photographic identification card shall be available at a location designated by the Commissioner. An individual issued an identification card under this subsection that contains an imaged likeness may renew his or her identification card by mail. Except that a renewal by an individual required to have a photograph or imaged likeness under this subsection must be made in person so that an updated imaged likeness of the individual is obtained not less often than once every nine years.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c03s115ol1h">
       An identification card issued to an individual who is under 18 years of age shall be distinguishable by color from an identification card issued to an individual who is 18 years of age or older but under 21 years of age, and both cards shall be distinguishable by color from an identification card issued to an individual 21 years of age or older. An identification card issued to an individual under 21 years of age shall clearly indicate, in prominent type, the date on which the individual will become 21. The distinguishing colors shall be the same as those used to distinguish operator's licenses issued under section 610 of this title.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c03s115ol1i">
       An identification card issued under this subsection to an initial or renewal applicant shall include data elements as prescribed in 6 C.F.R. § 37.19.

       Individuals receiving Supplemental Security Income or Social Security Disability Income and individuals with a disability as defined in <cite class="vt-code">9 V.S.A. § 4501(2)</cite> shall be provided with nondriver identification cards for the following fees:

        Editor's note.
       </b>
       The text of this section is based on the harmonization of two amendments. During the 1969 Adjourned Session, this section was amended twice, by Act Nos. 259 and 297, resulting in two versions of this section. In order to reflect all of the changes enacted by the Legislature during the 1969 Adjourned Session, the text of Act Nos. 259 and 297 was merged to arrive at a single version of this section. The changes that each of the amendments made are described in the amendment notes set out below.

        Department of Motor Vehicles properly relied on address listed by purchaser of vehicle who, with plaintiff's consent, had registered vehicle in plaintiff's name to notify plaintiff of license suspension, and notice was effective regardless of whether plaintiff actually received notice.

        Constructive notice of suspension of driver's license is sufficient even absent actual notice; as long as notice is sent by registered or certified mail to the last known address, the suspension is in full force and effect three days after the deposit of such notice in the mail.

       <p>
        Defendant's alleged failure to receive delivery of notice of suspension of driver's license, mailed by certified mail, two notices of the arrival of which were placed in defendant's mailbox, was not sufficient to bar conviction for operating a motor vehicle after suspension of license. State v. Cattanach, 129 Vt. 57, 271 A.2d 828 (1970).

The organization's name and emblem must not infringe on or violate a trademark, trade name, service mark, copyright, or other proprietary or property right, and the organization must have the right to use the name and emblem. After consulting with the principal contact, the Commissioner shall determine the design of the special plate on the basis that the primary purpose of motor vehicle number plates is vehicle identification. An organization may have only one design, regardless of the number of individual organizational units, squads, or departments within the State that may conduct the same or substantially similar activities.

Notwithstanding <cite class="vt-code">32 V.S.A. § 502</cite>, the Commissioner may charge the actual costs of production of the plates against the fees collected and the balance shall be deposited in the Transportation Fund. Upon application, special plates shall be issued to a registrant of a vehicle registered at the pleasure car rate or of a truck registered for less than 26,001 pounds (but excluding trucks registered under the International Registration Plan) who furnishes the Commissioner satisfactory proof that he or she is a member of an organization that has satisfied the requirements of this subdivision (b)(2). For each of the first 100 applicants to whom sets of plates are issued, the $17.00 special plate fee shall not be collected and shall be subtracted from the balance of the deposit. When the $1,700.00 balance of the deposit is depleted, applicants shall be required to pay the $17.00 fee as provided for in subdivision (2)(B) of this subsection. No organization shall charge its members any additional fee or premium charge for the authorization, right, or privilege to display special number plates, but any organization may recover up to $1,700.00 from applicants for the special plates.

        Editor's note.
       </b>
       The text of this section is based on the harmonization of two amendments. During the 2003 Adjourned Session, this section was amended twice, by Act Nos. 109 and 160, resulting in two versions of this section. In order to reflect all of the changes enacted by the Legislature during the 2003 Adjourned Session, the text of Act Nos. 109 and 160 was merged to arrive at a single version of this section. The changes that each of the amendments made are described in the amendment notes set out below.

        Vermont's ban under 23 V.S.A.
        §
        304(d)(4), on all vanity license plate combinations that referred, in any language, to a religion or deity, constituted unconstitutional viewpoint discrimination. The ban on all religious messages in a nonpublic forum served not to restrict content but instead impermissibly restricted expression from a religious viewpoint and thus violated the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment. Byrne v. Rutledge, 623 F.3d 46 (2d Cir. 2010).

       <p>
        Vermont's ban under 23 V.S.A.
        §
        304(d)(4), was not reasonable as applied to plaintiff motorist who requested a vanity license plate that referred to a Bible verse because the prohibition on any language that referred to a religion or deity did not further either of the purported state interests in support of the ban which were avoiding disruption and distraction of drivers and avoiding the perception that the government favored certain ideas. Byrne v. Rutledge, 623 F.3d 46 (2d Cir. 2010).

        Claim that administrative regulation allowing reservation of low number license plates was invalid under test requiring a regulation to be in harmony with overall statutory scheme, uniform in operation and equal in effect, and claim that the regulation was ultra vires as being beyond the statutory authority of Commissioner promulgating it, were moot and would not be decided, where the regulation had been incorporated into this section.

        That regulation providing for reservation of low number license plates had been incorporated into this section, governing the field, did not of itself, on ground issue was moot, keep court from deciding constitutional claim of denial of Equal Protection, but where plaintiff attacked the reservation scheme, then obtained a low number within the reserve group of numbers, he was in the favored class of which he complained and the issue was moot and would not be decided.

        Under the provision of subsec. (d) of this section, stating that "[t]he commissioner may refuse to honor any request that might be offensive or confusing to the general public," the Commissioner may not refuse to honor a request unless she determines that the request might be offensive or confusing. Martin v. State, 175 Vt. 80, 819 A.2d 742 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Administrative regulation promulgated under subsec. (d) of this section extended beyond the statutory language and permitted the Commissioner to reject requests for plates that are themselves inoffensive but belong in one of several designated categories that include words with the potential to offend. Martin v. State, 175 Vt. 80, 819 A.2d 742 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Administrative regulation that permitted the Commissioner to reject requests for vanity plates belonging in designated categories could not support a decision to deny an application for a plate displaying the letters "IRISH" in that it prescribed a standard which the Legislature has not authorized the Commissioner to fix. Martin v. State, 175 Vt. 80, 819 A.2d 742 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        The plaintiff did not have a First Amendment right to use vanity plates bearing the letters "SHTHPNS" since (1) vanity plates do not constitute a public forum, and (2) the defendant's policy of prohibiting vanity plates with offensive scatological terms was reasonable and viewpoint-neutral. Perry v. McDonald, 280 F.3d 159 (2d Cir. 2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        The defendants did not violate the plaintiff's due process rights under the Fourteenth Amendment when they revoked vanity plates bearing the letters "SHTHPNS" after issuing them in error, notwithstanding her contention that she was entitled to a prerevocation hearing, where (1) she was given notice that her vanity plates were to be revoked and was afforded a postrevocation hearing at which she prevailed, (2) the defendants attempted to contact her to give her temporary plates so that she could drive pending the result of the hearing, and (3) the defendants even reinstated the SHTHPNS plates pending the result of the hearing because the plaintiff insisted, contrary to the view of the defendants, that she would have waived her right to appeal had she accepted the temporary plates. Perry v. McDonald, 280 F.3d 159 (2d Cir. 2001).

The person in whose name the transferred vehicle was registered shall immediately return to the Commissioner the registration certificate assigned to the transferred vehicle, with the date of transfer and the name and residence of the new owner endorsed on the back. However, the Commissioner may accept any other satisfactory evidence of the date of transfer and new ownership. The transferor shall immediately remove the registration number plates from the transferred vehicle and may attach the registration number plates to another unregistered motor vehicle owned by him or her and the owner or operator shall not, for a period of 60 days, be subject to a civil penalty for the operation of the latter motor vehicle without the proper registration certificate, provided he or she has, within 24 hours of the transfer, made application, as provided in section 323 of this title, for transfer of the registration number plates. If such application for transfer is not so received by the Commissioner, the number plates shall be returned to the Commissioner at the end of five days after the transfer of ownership.

      Subject to the conditions set forth in subdivisions (1), (2), and (3) of this section, the Commissioner may cancel the registration of a motor vehicle, snowmobile, or motorboat when the owner returns to the Commissioner either the number plates, if any, or the registration certificate. Upon cancellation of the registration, the Commissioner shall notify the Commissioner of Finance and Management, who shall issue a refund as follows:
     </p>
     <ol>
      <li id="t23c07sub01s327ol11">
       For registrations cancelled prior to the beginning of the registration period, the refund is the full amount of the fee paid, less a charge of $5.00.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c07sub01s327ol12">
       For registrations cancelled within 30 days of the date of issue, the refund is the full amount of the fee paid, less a charge of $5.00. The owner of a motor vehicle must prove to the Commissioner's satisfaction that the number plates have not been used or attached to a motor vehicle.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c07sub01s327ol13">
       For registrations cancelled prior to the beginning of the second year of a two-year registration period, the refund is one-half of the full amount of the two-year fee paid, less a charge of $5.00.

        Where the Department of Motor Vehicles audited petitioner's records to test compliance with this section and at the time of the audit petitioner had lost its records for 1982, the Department's decision to use information from a prior audit, in which it had audited petitioner's records for May 1982 and November 1982, in order to estimate the number of petitioner's unreported entries for July through November 1982 was reasonable, even though May 1982 was outside the audit period.

       Instead of registering each motor vehicle owned by him or her, a dealer may apply under oath to the Commissioner, upon forms prescribed and furnished by the Commissioner for that purpose, and accompanied by such additional information and certifications as the Commissioner may reasonably require, for a general distinguishing number for such motor vehicles. If the Commissioner is satisfied that the applicant meets all the requirements of section 4 and chapter 7 of this title and is qualified to engage in such business, the Commissioner may issue to the applicant a certificate of registration containing the name, place of residence, and address of such applicant, the general distinguishing number assigned, and such additional information as the Commissioner may determine. If a dealer has a place of business or agency in more than one city or town, he or she shall file an application and secure a certificate of registration for each place of business or agency. The place of business or agency shall mean a place in any town where motor vehicles owned by a dealer are regularly kept or exposed for sale in the custody or control of the dealer or a salesman, employee, or agent of such dealer. In his or her discretion, the Commissioner may assign the same distinguishing number with more than one certificate to any dealer who has separate places of business within the same or an adjacent city or town within Vermont. The Commissioner may allow a dealer having one distinguishing number with more than one certificate to maintain only one central area for the maintenance of records required by law to be kept, including those required by section 466 of this title and for the transfer of motor vehicles. This location must be in Vermont and must be disclosed on the application prior to approval and may be changed only with the approval of the Commissioner or his or her agent. Dealer registration plates shall contain letters indicating the type of dealer certificate issued before the distinguishing number.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c07sub04s451ol1b">
       With the prior approval of the Commissioner, a Vermont dealer may display vehicles on a temporary basis, but in no instance for more than 14 consecutive days, at a fair, show, exhibition, or other off-site location. New vehicles may only be displayed off-site within the manufacturer's stated area of responsibility in the franchise agreement. No sales may be transacted at these off-site locations. A dealer desiring to display vehicles temporarily at an off-site location shall notify the Commissioner in a manner prescribed by the Commissioner no less than two days prior to the first day for which approval is requested.

The Commissioner is authorized to charge a fee of $6.00 for the processing of the plate application and the issuance of the plate. The dealer, upon the sale of a motor vehicle to be transported to and registered in another state or province, shall cause the application to be filled out and transmitted to the Commissioner and shall attach to the vehicle the in-transit number plate corresponding to the application. No registered motor vehicle dealer shall sell, exchange, give, or transfer any application or in-transit plate to any person other than the person to whom the dealer sells or exchanges a motor vehicle to be registered in another state or province. The application shall be in a form prescribed and furnished by the Commissioner. The special in-transit number plate to be attached to the vehicle will be issued in the form and design as prescribed by the Commissioner and shall be valid for a period of 30 days from the date of issue.

        In prosecution for operating motor vehicle on public highway with number plates attached that were not lawfully assigned to such vehicle, criminal responsibility of respondent was not lessened by cooperation with him of another person in operating automobile in violation of statutes on which prosecution was based.

        Court finds a proper reading of the statute regarding display of license plates to be that a license plate ceases to be horizontal when the angle of the license makes it difficult for a person with normal vision to read it; the Court declines at this point to define what that angle is. Of course, evidence of an observer's ability to read a license plate may inform an interpretation in a specific case. State v. Tuma, 194 Vt. 345, 79 A.3d 883 (2013).

       <p>
        Proper reading of the statute regarding display of license plates was that a license plate ceased to be "horizontal" when its angle made it difficult for a person with normal vision to read it. Thus, when one side of defendant's front license plate was about one to two inches lower than the other side, an officer lacked reasonable suspicion for a traffic stop based on the plate's not being horizontal.

      <li id="t23c09sub01s607aol1a">
       A learner's permit or junior operator's license shall contain an admonition that it is recallable and that the later procurement of an operator's license is conditional on the establishment of a record that is satisfactory to the Commissioner and showing compliance with the motor vehicle laws of this and other states. The Commissioner may recall any permit or license issued to a minor whenever he or she is satisfied, from information provided by a credible person and upon investigation, that the operator is mentally or physically unfit or, because of his or her habits or record as to accidents or convictions, is unsafe to be trusted with the operation of motor vehicles. On recommendation of a diversion or reparative board, the Commissioner may recall the learner's permit or junior operator's license of a person in a diversion or reparative program for up to 30 days. The Commissioner shall also recall any learner's permit or junior operator's license for 30 days when an operator is adjudicated of a single texting violation under section 1099 of this title, 90 days following adjudication of a single speeding violation resulting in a three-point assessment, 90 days when a total of six points has been accumulated, or 90 days when an operator is adjudicated of a violation of subsection 614(c) or 615(a) of this title. When a learner's permit or junior operator's license is so recalled, it shall be reinstated upon expiration of a specific term and, if required by the Commissioner, when the person has passed a reexamination approved by the Commissioner.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c09sub01s607aol1b">
       When a license or permit is recalled under the provisions of this section, the person whose license or permit is so recalled shall have the same right of hearing before the Commissioner as is provided in subsection 671(a) of this title.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c09sub01s607aol1c">
       Except for a recall based solely upon the provisions of subsection (d) of this section, any recall of a license or permit may extend past the operator's 18th birthday. While the recall is still in effect, that operator shall be ineligible for any operator's license.
      </li>
      <li id="t23c09sub01s607aol1d">
       The Commissioner shall recall a learner's permit or junior operator's license upon written request of the individual's custodial parent or guardian.

     <p>
      The Commissioner may designate physicians, licensed physician assistants, licensed advanced practice registered nurses, ophthalmologists, oculists, and optometrists properly registered and authorized to practice in this State or in an adjoining state as examiners of operators. The Commissioner may refer any matter relative to the issuing, suspending, or reinstating of licenses that concerns the physical or mental condition or eyesight of any applicant for or holder of a license or any petitioner for reinstatement to, and require the applicant or other person to be examined by, such examiner in the vicinity of the person's residence as he or she determines to be qualified to examine and report. Such examiner shall report to the Commissioner the true and actual result of examinations made by him or her together with his or her decision as to whether the person examined should be granted or allowed to retain an operator's license or permitted to operate a motor vehicle.

    2 as amended by <cite class="vt-code">2013, No. 18</cite>,
    <span class="s1">
     §
    </span>
    1a, provides: "(a) The court administrator, the court diversion program, and the department of motor vehicles shall work cooperatively in an effort to assist Vermonters who have a suspended motor vehicle operator's license to regain their license through participation in the DLS diversion program, as provided in this section.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(b)(1) Except as provided in subdivision (2) of this subsection, the court administrator shall notify a person who has had his or her operator's license suspended that he or she is eligible to participate in the DLS diversion program, which is intended to assist people in regaining their operator's license. A person shall be eligible to participate in the DLS diversion program if the person completes all the requirements of the underlying violation and the suspension and if, as a result, the person would otherwise be eligible to regain his or her license if not for unmet financial obligations.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) A person whose operator's license is suspended for a violation of 23 V.S.A.
     §§
     1091(b), 1094(b), 1128(b) or (c), or 1201 or 1205 shall not be eligible to participate in the DLS diversion program with respect to the suspension for such violation.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(3) The notice shall provide that:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(A) The program is designed to assist the person to get his or her driver's license reinstated prior to completion of payment of any debt related to the suspension.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(B) The person may be eligible for a reduction in the amount of the person's financial obligation to the state or may be permitted to establish a reasonable payment plan to discharge the debt.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(C) The program is voluntary but agreeing to participate would include certain requirements including:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(i) meeting with diversion staff to assess the person's risks and to identify factors that contributed to previous violations leading to license suspension.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(ii) completing all conditions related to the offense and indicated by the screening process that are imposed by the diversion program.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(4) The court administrator may charge the cost of preparing and sending the notice against revenues collected pursuant to this subsection.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(c) Upon receiving a request from a person who has been issued a notice pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, the diversion program shall register the person in the DLS diversion program. The program staff shall meet with the person to assess the person's risks and to identify factors that contributed to previous violations leading to license suspension. Based upon the assessment, the program shall develop a contract with the person that may include:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(1) Adherence to a plan to pay fines and fees required to reinstate a driver's license.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) Acquiring and showing proof of auto insurance.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(3) Performance of community service.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(4) Completion of a driving education program.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(5) Any other conditions related to the reasons for the violation that led to license suspension.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(d) A person with violations of 23 V.S.A.
     §
     676 may apply to the DLS Diversion Program. Upon receipt of an application and determination of eligibility, the Diversion Program shall send the person a notice to report to the Diversion Program. The notice to report shall provide that the person is required to meet with diversion staff for the purposes of assessment and to complete all conditions of the diversion contract as provided in subsection (c) of this section.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(e) The diversion program shall notify the judicial bureau of acceptance of a person into the DLS diversion program and that a contract has been agreed to by the parties. Upon approval of the contract and any related payment plan, the judicial bureau shall notify the department of motor vehicles of compliance with the contract and the person shall be eligible to have his or her license reinstated, provided the person remains in compliance with the diversion contract. The department of motor vehicles may suspend a person's license for failure to comply with the diversion contract.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(f) The DLS diversion program shall work cooperatively with the judicial bureau to establish a reasonable payment plan for fines and fees owed by a person enrolled in the program. In addition to any remedies already provided, the judicial bureau may do the following in cases involving a person enrolled in the DLS diversion program:
    </p>
    <p>
     "(1) Reduce the amount of fines or fees owed in exchange for community service or education, or both, as provided in a diversion contract.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(2) Withdraw any debt placed for collection with a collection agency or the department of taxes.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(g) The court diversion program, in cooperation with the judiciary, shall adopt standards for operating the DLS diversion program, including determining whether a person is in compliance with conditions as set forth in this section. The standards shall specifically identify circumstances, such as additional violations or accumulation of points, which shall require additional contract conditions and circumstances that will result in dismissal from the program. Such standards shall be applicable in all county diversion programs.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(h) Each participant shall pay a fee to the local adult court diversion project. The amount of the fee shall be determined by the program using a sliding-scale fee based on financial means of the participant. The fee shall not exceed $300.00. Notwithstanding 32 V.S.A.
     §
     502(a), fees collected under this subsection shall be retained and used solely for the purpose of the DLS diversion program.
    </p>
    <p>
     "(i) The court administrator shall begin notification as provided in subsection (b) of this section by January 15, 2013, at which time the DLS diversion program shall be operational. Priority shall be given to persons determined to be at highest risk of acquiring a criminal DLS pursuant to 23 V.S.A.
     §
     674 due to an accumulation of civil suspension violations pursuant to 23 V.S.A.

    </p>
    <p>
     "(k) The court administrator, the director of the court diversion program, and the commissioner of motor vehicles shall jointly report to the general assembly on or before December 15, 2014 on the following:

    <p>
     "(1) implementation of the DLS diversion program;

    <p>
     "(7) the advisability of implementing the program through roadside stops for driving without a license; and
    </p>

If, upon receipt of such notice, the individual requests a hearing, such suspension shall not take effect unless the Commissioner, after hearing, determines that the suspension is justified. If the Commissioner imposes a suspension, he or she may order the license delivered to him or her. Not less than six months from the date of suspension and each six months thereafter, an individual upon whom such suspension has been imposed may apply for reinstatement of his or her license or right to operate or for a new license.

       The text of this section is based on the harmonization of two amendments. During the 2019 Adjourned Session, this section was amended twice, by Act Nos. 131 and 149, resulting in two versions of this section. In order to reflect all of the changes enacted by the Legislature during the 2019 Adjourned Session, the text of Act Nos. 131 and 149 was merged to arrive at a single version of this section. Subsecs. (a) and (c) were each amended in one conflicting way by these two acts. In those instances, only the amendments from Act No. 149 are reflected in the text, however, and not the amendments from Act No. 131, as the stated purpose of Act No. 131 was to make only technical amendments and
       §
       303 of the act specified that, to the extent that Act No. 131 may conflict with other acts of the same biennium, "the substantive changes in other acts shall take precedence over the technical changes of this act." The changes that each of the amendments made are described in the amendment notes set out below.

         1. Constitutionality.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        This section is not constitutionally infirm because of its failure to require a hearing prior to suspension of motor vehicle operator's license, since Due Process Clause does not require that Vermont provide a separate pre-suspension hearing determining degree of hardship suspension will cause to motorists who face possible suspension of their operator's licenses; opportunity to contest the actual traffic offense in court provides the motorist with a hearing which is sufficient to meet due process standards. Calabi v. Malloy, 438 F. Supp. 1165 (D. Vt. 1977), judgment amended, 468 F. Supp. 76 (D. Vt. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not violate Equal Protection Clause since rational basis exists for providing pre-suspension hearing for Vermont licensees who have been convicted of motor vehicle offenses in other states and who are deemed improper or incompetent to operate motor vehicles, while denying pre-suspension hearings for Vermont licensees convicted of traffic offense in Vermont; those convicted of traffic offenses outside Vermont who are provided with pre-suspension hearings would otherwise have no opportunity to be heard in Vermont, while those traffic offenders inside Vermont who are denied pre-suspension hearings retain the right to a full judicial hearing in Vermont on the facts underlying the charges against them. Calabi v. Malloy, 438 F. Supp. 1165 (D. Vt. 1977), judgment amended, 468 F. Supp. 76 (D. Vt. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since Commissioner's procedural guidelines administered in suspending motor vehicle operator's licenses are reasonably specific and ascertainable and prescribe suspensions which are both within the statutory maximum and within normally acceptable limits, the scheme of this section does not unconstitutionally fail to provide standards for the exercise of administrative discretion. Calabi v. Malloy, 438 F. Supp. 1165 (D. Vt. 1977), judgment amended, 468 F. Supp. 76 (D. Vt. 1978).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Where notice of suspension of motor vehicle operator's license did not give any indication of operator's right to a hearing, and operator failed to request a hearing, even though the guarantees of hearing pursuant to this section apply to suspension of an operator's license, operator could not claim that his rights were infringed in view of agreed statement of facts and his admission that he did utter a bad check in payment of license; however, better procedure would be that notice contain reference to provisions of this section, indicating opportunity for hearing upon request.

        Where driver had pleaded guilty to his seventh, eighth, and ninth traffic violations, but later moved to withdraw guilty pleas as being involuntary because of his unawareness of the full consequence of his pleas, a two year license suspension for anyone having eight or more violations within a five year period, and evidence showed that in at least two of the violations driver was given ticket containing prominent notice of possible liabilities if guilty, motion to withdraw guilty plea was correctly refused, for driver had received adequate notice as to the consequences of such a plea.

        Where traffic citation indicated that a violation of both ordinance and State statute was charged, Supreme Court found that citation charged a State statute and that the reference to the ordinance was mere surplusage, so that argument license to drive could not be revoked under this section, allowing revocation after eight state law moving violations in five consecutive years, because one of driver's violations was of an ordinance, was of no avail.

        When a license to operate a motor vehicle is suspended for driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of section 1201 of this title, subsec. (c) of this section would apply during the definite term of the suspension, but subsec. (a) would apply after the definite term had expired but prior to reinstatement of the license. State v. Potier, 150 Vt. 15, 547 A.2d 1359 (1988).

        Where the Legislature expanded the definition of "license to operate" in section 4(48) of this title to include "privilege to operate," it overruled Supreme Court's decision in State v. Cady, 136 Vt. 29, 383 A.2d 607 (1978), wherein it held that a person who had never possessed a driver's license could not be prosecuted for driving with license suspended, because there was nothing for anyone to suspend. State v. Jarvis, 145 Vt. 8, 482 A.2d 65 (1984).

       <p>
        Where person charged with operating a motor vehicle after his right or license to operate had been suspended and before reinstatement had never had a license or right to operate, there was nothing for anyone to suspend or reinstate, the obvious charge was operating without a license, and judgment of acquittal would be ordered. State v. Cady, 136 Vt. 29, 383 A.2d 607 (1978). But see State v. Jarvis, 145 Vt. 8, 482 A.2d 65 (1984).

        In trial for operating a motor vehicle after license suspension, defendant's claim that first suspension was illegal because the notice did not advise him of his statutory right to hearing and an attorney and incorrectly advised him of the period within which he must file proof of financial responsibility should have been heard and determined.

        In trial for operating a motor vehicle after license suspension, defendant's claim that suspension was illegal because of illegal delegation to a subordinate officer of discretion to suspend contested only method and not the underlying authority of the department to order suspension, and was not a jurisdictional claim and thus could not be collaterally attacked in the instant trial.

       <p>
        In a prosecution for driving while under license suspension, claim that underlying suspension was illegal because of illegal delegation of authority to impose suspension within the Department of Motor Vehicles does not reach jurisdiction of person or subject matter in the suspension proceeding and is not appropriate for collateral attack in the criminal prosecution.

        Information that cited the recidivism statute defendant was accused of violating, dates of two previous civil violations, and penalty for present offense was sufficient to apprise defendant that criminal charge stemmed from prior civil violations.

        Constructive notice of suspension of driver's license is sufficient even absent actual notice; as long as notice is sent by registered or certified mail to the last known address, the suspension is in full force and effect three days after the deposit of such notice in the mail. State v. Chicoine, 154 Vt. 653, 580 A.2d 970 (mem.) (1990).
       </p>

       <p>
        Defendant's alleged failure to receive delivery of notice of suspension of driver's license, mailed by certified mail, two notices of the arrival of which were placed in defendant's mailbox, was not sufficient to bar conviction for operating a motor vehicle after suspension of license. State v. Cattanach, 129 Vt. 57, 271 A.2d 828 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>

        This section does not provide the procedure to be followed in a case involving a prior conviction or convictions, however it is clear that the penalty is to be graduated according to the status of the respondent as to prior similar convictions and the procedure to be followed in such cases is discretionary with the trial court.

       </p>
       <p>
        Notice of intention by prosecution to ask that greater punishment be imposed because of prior convictions under this section must be given before arraignment or trial to provide accused with opportunity to resolve propriety of insisting on constitutional and statutory rights and this must be done by charging principal offense and prior convictions in two parts in complaint.

        §
        674(c), the third DLS adjudication does not allow criminal penalties if one or both of the earlier adjudications are vacated. Section 674(c) is a penalty-enhancement provision, and not a status offense. The Legislature's scheme, in decriminalizing first- and second-offense driving with a suspended license, was to reduce penalties, not to create new offenses. State v.

       <p>
        In a trial for driving with a suspended license, the evidence did not require the trial court to grant acquittal by its own motion. Although defendant argued that no one actually saw him drive into the store, one witness testified that defendant's van hit the store and that he saw defendant exit the van; another witness saw defendant behind the wheel moments after the accident; when the store owner arrived, defendant apologized for the damage; police testified that the van was registered to defendant; when police spoke with defendant the day after the accident, he asserted that he had been drinking the previous day and did not remember the accident; and police also testified that when they asked defendant if anybody was exiting the store at the time of the crash, defendant responded that no one had been leaving at the time. State v. LaFlam, 184 Vt. 629, 965 A.2d 519 (mem.) (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to convict defendant of driving with license suspended, State was not required to prove that his license was suspended for violating DUI statute, since evidence of defendant's failure to satisfy statute conditioning license reinstatement on his successful completion of alcohol and driving education program was sufficient for jury to find fact of the qualifying underlying suspension. State v. Longe, 170 Vt. 35, 743 A.2d 569 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        State does not have to prove each prior civil violation of driving with a suspended license (DLS) to convict a third time DLS violater on misdemeanor charge. State v. Lafountain, 160 Vt. 313, 628 A.2d 1243 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution for violating this section, evidence that driver's insurance had in fact never terminated was admissible to prove that the Department of Motor Vehicles was without authority to suspend driver's license pursuant to section 803 of this title for failure to show proof of financial responsibility.

        It was error to order defendant, who was convicted of driving with a suspended license, to pay restitution for damage to a store that he drove into. Vermont law required there to be a direct link between the loss for which restitution was ordered and the conduct for which a defendant had been convicted, and there was not such a link here.

        Where information alleged that defendant operated a motor vehicle on a public highway while her license to operate was suspended, and that defendant had previously been convicted of the same offense, but did not allege that the present violation occurred while defendant was under suspension as a result of a prior conviction for a violation of one of the six sections enumerated in subsec. (c) of this section, failure to allege the basis of the suspension in the information rendered the mandatory minimum sentence provisions of subsec. (c) inapplicable to defendant's case. State v.

        Change in law that reclassified as a civil violation, rather than a criminal offense, the operation of a motor vehicle with a suspended license after suspension period had expired and prior to reinstatement was applied retroactively since the change did not remove all liability for violative conduct.

       <p>
        In a repeat-offender prosecution for driving with a suspended license (DLS) in violation of 23 V.S.A.
        §
        674(c), the third DLS adjudication does not allow criminal penalties if one or both of the earlier adjudications are vacated. Section 674(c) is a penalty-enhancement provision, and not a status offense. The Legislature's scheme, in decriminalizing first- and second-offense DLS, was to reduce penalties, not to create new offenses. State v. LeClair, 167 Vt. 32, 702 A.2d 628 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Information that cited the recidivism statute defendant was accused of violating, dates of two previous civil violations, and penalty for present offense was sufficient to apprise defendant that criminal charge stemmed from prior civil violations. State v. Lafountain, 160 Vt. 313, 628 A.2d 1243 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        State does not have to prove each prior civil violation of driving with a suspended license (DLS) to convict a third time DLS violator on misdemeanor charge. State v. Lafountain, 160 Vt. 313, 628 A.2d 1243 (1993).

Since the great majority of motorcycle accidents involve inexperienced operators, a training program focused on inexperienced operators is the primary purpose of this legislation.

        Legislature did not intend to prohibit fellow employee exclusions in business auto policies where employees were already covered by workers' compensation. Davis v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., 19 F. Supp. 2d 193 (D. Vt. 1998), aff'd, 267 F.3d 124 (2d Cir. 2001).

        Statutory language that "no owner or operator of a motor vehicle . . . shall operate . . . the vehicle" without required insurance does not require each vehicle owned by an insured to have its own insurance, limiting in turn uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage to each individual's policy.

        Unlike the Fifth Amendment, the Fourth Amendment's protection against unreasonable searches and seizures fully applies in the civil context and, therefore, applied in the context of a traffic stop related to suspicion of motorist's failure to have automobile insurance. Diamondstone v. Macaluso, 148 F.3d 113 (2d Cir. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that Vermont may order citizens to provide proof of insurance in conjunction with a valid traffic stop or when they apply for their annual state inspection sticker does not, however, mean that the State Police may pull motorists over without probable cause for the sole purpose of asking them to provide proof of insurance. Diamondstone v. Macaluso, 148 F.3d 113 (2d Cir. 1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since driving without insurance is a civil infraction, not a criminal offense, the State may require motorists to provide proof of insurance and may draw an adverse inference from a motorist's refusal to do so, without infringing the Fifth Amendment. Diamondstone v. Macaluso, 148 F.3d 113 (2d Cir. 1998).

        Financial responsibility laws are separate from an insurer's obligation to cover insureds wherever they become victims of an uninsured or underinsured motorist.

       The text of this section is based on the harmonization of two amendments. During the 1999 Adjourned Session, this section was amended twice, by Act Nos. 102 and 160, resulting in two versions of this section. In order to reflect all of the changes enacted by the Legislature during the 1999 Adjourned Session, the text of Act Nos. 102 and 160 was merged to arrive at a single version of this section. The changes that each of the amendments made are described in the amendment notes set out below.

       <p>
        That one convicted of a traffic violation indicating fault is not entitled under subdiv. (a)(4) of this section to an independent hearing on the question of fault prior to license suspension is not a denial of due process or equal protection; the driver has the chance for a hearing on the issue by pleading "not guilty" to the violation. Wright v. Malloy, 373 F. Supp. 1011 (D. Vt.), aff'd, 419 U.S. 987, 95 S. Ct. 297, 42 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1974). (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that subdiv. (a)(3) of this section provides a hearing for drivers who may be at fault in an accident but are not convicted of a motor vehicle violation while subdiv. (a)(4) does not provide a hearing for those convicted of motor vehicle violations does not create an arbitrary and capricious classification in violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, since a defendant charged with a motor vehicle violation is afforded a hearing in a court of law. Wright v. Malloy, 373 F. Supp. 1011 (D. Vt.), aff'd, 419 U.S. 987, 95 S. Ct. 297, 42 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1974). (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Provision of subdiv. (a)(4) of this section requiring driver involved in accident to obtain either a written release from all persons who sustained damages as a result of the accident or a security deposit adequate to satisfy any judgment for damages in order to retain his license did not unconstitutionally discriminate against those who could not afford to pay the security deposit. Wright v. Malloy, 373 F. Supp. 1011 (D. Vt.), aff'd, 419 U.S. 987, 95 S. Ct. 297, 42 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1974). (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Provision of subdiv. (a)(4) of this section requiring security for past accidents was justified by State's compelling interest in reducing the imposition of financial disaster upon persons injured by insecure and uninsured motorists. Wright v. Malloy, 373 F. Supp. 1011 (D. Vt.), aff'd, 419 U.S. 987, 95 S. Ct. 297, 42 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1974). (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not unconstitutionally discriminate against a single class of potential debtors. Wright v. Malloy, 373 F. Supp. 1011 (D. Vt.), aff'd, 419 U.S. 987, 95 S. Ct. 297, 42 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Provision of subdiv. (a)(4) of this section regarding the posting of security, and provision of section 802(a) of this title enforcing such security provision, were an unconstitutional denial of procedural due process in that no hearing was provided for on the amount of security to be posted. Wright v. Malloy, 373 F. Supp. 1011 (D. Vt.), aff'd, 419 U.S. 987, 95 S. Ct. 297, 42 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1974). (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>
       <p>
        Insofar as subdiv. (a)(3) of this section required a showing of financial responsibility without any determination of possibility of fault, it was unconstitutional. McNamara v. Malloy, 337 F. Supp. 732 (D. Vt. 1971). (Decided under prior law.)

        The purpose of the financial responsibility law is to protect the public and ensure that those motor vehicle operators who cause accidents for which they are liable have adequate resources to satisfy any claims arising from the accidents. Wright v. Malloy, 373 F. Supp. 1011 (D. Vt.), aff'd, 419 U.S. 987, 95 S. Ct. 297, 42 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of the financial responsibility law is to reduce the imposition of financial disaster on the general public that may be injured through the negligence or recklessness of financially insecure and uninsured motor vehicle operators and as the legislation is neither arbitrary nor irrational it is, generally, constitutional. Miller v. Malloy, 343 F. Supp. 46 (D. Vt. 1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of this section is to require uninsured drivers involved in accidents to furnish evidence of financial responsibility for future accidents and the word "operator" used therein should be interpreted broadly. 1964-66 Op. Atty. Gen. 170.

Wright v. Malloy, 373 F. Supp. 1011 (D. Vt.), aff'd, 419 U.S. 987, 95 S. Ct. 297, 42 L. Ed. 2d 261 (1974). (Decided under prior law.)

        941(f), directs mandatory uninsured/underinsured motorists' coverage in all forms of motor vehicle insurance, including self insurance, so that all motorists have minimum protection from financially irresponsible drivers. Colwell v. Allstate Insurance Co., 175 Vt. 61, 819 A.2d 727 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Resolution of the question whether a self-insured employer's underinsured motorists' coverage was equal to or less than a tortfeasor-motorist's liability coverage required a factual inquiry into the limits of the employer's self-insurance plan because "self insurance" is a term with no specific legal meaning. Colwell v. Allstate Insurance Co., 175 Vt. 61, 819 A.2d 727 (2003).

        Although the financial responsibility portion of the motor vehicle law is unclear about the cancellation of an automobile policy and the lapse of any such policy, the purpose of the statute is to let the state agencies know when dangerous drivers may be forgoing their required insurance and to take steps appropriately, and in the absence of legislative direction, lapses and cancellations of these policies should be treated the same and the insurer should be required in both cases to notify the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles 15 days in advance of such lapse or cancellation.

      When evidence of the insuring of a person, convicted of a violation of a motor vehicle law within the terms of this title, is offered as proof of financial responsibility, the presentation of such proof shall include certification that the policy of insurance or indemnity bond has a certificate waiving, as against injured persons, all defenses based on false representation or breach of warranties as set forth in the application for the policy of insurance or indemnity bond by the insured attached. Such contract, bond, or policy of insurance shall be for the benefit of a person injured in person or property, to the amounts indicated, to satisfy the legal liability of the insured.

      In lieu of all or part of the insurance or bond required by section 881 of this title, a motor bus owner may file with the Commissioner a bond conditioned for the payment and discharge of all liability described in section 881 of this title provided the policy of insurance, if any, or bond is approved by an order of the Transportation Board filed with the Commissioner determining the amount, if any, of insurance to be procured and the amount of a bond in addition to or in substitution for insurance. The Board may approve a bond without surety if it determines, by order made upon proper showing, that a surety on the bond is not required by the public interest because of the proven financial responsibility of the obligor, or because of collateral security consisting of deposits in a Vermont bank or negotiable securities held by such bank as trustee, or a combination thereof, pledged to secure the performance of the bond upon terms and conditions prescribed by the Board. If the order requires insurance or a surety bond, the policy of insurance or surety bond shall be executed by a company authorized to do business in this State.

    </h5>
    <p>
     Insurer that issued a comprehensive general liability policy to a company was not required to provided uninsured/underinsured (UM/UIM) coverage to an executive officer who was injured while riding his personal motorcycle and while he was not on company business because under the circumstances, the executive officer was not an "insured" under the policy. Statutorily required UM/UIM coverage extended only to those insured under the policy. Mayhew v. Alterra Excess & Surplus Ins. Co., - F. Supp. 2d - (D. Vt. Jan. 25, 2012).
    </p>
    <p>
     The design of this subchapter is to protect a responsibly insured motorist against the unfortunate hazard presented by an injury inflicted in an accident with an irresponsible operator who is uninsured or has fled the scene, leaving the insured without recourse for the damage inflicted.

     The court must construe this subchapter and the insurance policy to achieve the primary purpose of the enactment. Rhault v. Tsagarakos, 361 F. Supp. 202 (D. Vt. 1973).
    </p>
    <p>
     This subchapter has fashioned the means to benefit an insured who has provided protection for others, to obtain protection for himself; thus, the law attempts to provide coverage in the insured's own policy, and at his premium, where it does not exist with the other operator. Rhault v. Tsagarakos, 361 F. Supp. 202 (D. Vt. 1973).

    </h5>
    <p>
     The purpose of this subchapter and a policy issued under it is to provide the insured with a source of recovery of damages caused by an uninsured motorist; thus, the policy is in the nature of a limited type of accident insurance, rather than the usual indemnity contract.

       <p>
        Vermont's uninsured/underinsured motorist statute now embraces both a "gap coverage" and "excess coverage" approach. Progressive Cas. Ins. Co. v. MMG Ins. Co., 197 Vt. 253, 103 A.3d 899 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Consistent with legislative intent and the plain language of the statute, the law now allows an injured individual to recover uninsured/underinsured motorist (UM/UIM) benefits under policies that he or she had purchased when a tortfeasor's liability insurance has been depleted by payments to multiple victims. In other words, rather than engaging in a strict limits-to-limits analysis in multi-victim accidents as in Colwell, it is now appropriate to consider how much an injured party actually recovers under a liability policy and to compare that value to the limits of the victim's own UM/UIM policies. Progressive Cas. Ins. Co. v. MMG Ins. Co., 197 Vt. 253, 103 A.3d 899 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Legislature's decision to predicate the application of the uninsured/underinsured motorist statute on the nature of the coverage rather than - as elsewhere in the chapter - the type of policy supports a conclusion that the Legislature fully intended the broad scope that the specific language commands. Absent any evidence of an intent to the contrary, therefore, there are no grounds to depart from the plain meaning of the statute. Insurance Co. of the State of Pennsylvania. v. Johnson, 186 Vt. 435, 987 A.2d 276 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        While uninsured/underinsured (UM/UIM) coverage arises in the context of automobile insurance, it is in essence self-insurance. By purchasing the mandated UM/UIM coverage, the insured is guaranteed at least that amount of recovery regardless of a lower level of liability insurance purchased by a tortfeasor; in that sense, the UM/UIM insurance attaches to the policy holder who purchases it, unlike liability coverage, which attaches to the vehicle insured. Hubbard v. Metro. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 182 Vt. 501, 944 A.2d 891 (Nov. 2, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where a tortfeasor-motorist's liability policy limits are greater than the injured party's underinsurance limits, but are insufficient to satisfy the injured party's damages because of payments made to other victims of the same accident, the tortfeasor is not underinsured under the plain language of subsec. (f) of this section. Colwell v. Allstate Insurance Co., 175 Vt. 61, 819 A.2d 727 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Subsec. (f) of this section directs mandatory uninsured/underinsured motorists' coverage in all forms of motor vehicle insurance, including self insurance, so that all motorists have minimum protection from financially irresponsible drivers. Colwell v. Allstate Insurance Co., 175 Vt. 61, 819 A.2d 727 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        In determining the level of underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage available to a single insured who is among multiple injured persons with claims against a tortfeasor's single-limit policy, subsec. (f) of this section requires comparison of the personal injury limits of liability in the tortfeasor's policy, irrespective of the number of claimants, to the maximum limit of liability available to any one person under the insured's UIM coverage. Derosier v. Pawtucket Mut. Ins. Co., 175 Vt. 76, 819 A.2d 739 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where underinsured motorist coverage is imposed by operation of 23 V.S.A.
        §
        941, the coverage does not include punitive damages that would have been assessed against a third-party tortfeasor. Pecor v. Elrac, Inc., - F. Supp. 2d - (D. Vt. July 11, 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        A motorist's intentionally throwing a tire iron at plaintiff's vehicle was not an "accident" under plaintiff's uninsured motorist coverage, and coverage therefor was not required by this section. Landry v. Dairyland Insurance Co., 166 Vt. 634, 701 A.2d 1035 (mem.) (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        The benefit that a policyholder receives from uninsured/underinsured motorist (UM/UIM) coverage is protection against the probability of deficient recovery from the tortfeasor, not guaranteed receipt of payment equal to the UM/UIM coverage. Travelers Cos. v. Liberty Mutual Insurance Co., 164 Vt. 368, 670 A.2d 827 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plain language of statute requires coverage only for the protection of persons insured under the policy; if the Legislature intended 941(a) to provide broader coverage, it would have substituted the phrase "for the protection of persons occupying said motor vehicle" in place of "for the protection of persons insured thereunder." Norman v. King, 163 Vt. 612, 659 A.2d 1123 (mem.) (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        It would be inequitable to allow a tortfeasor to escape liability whenever a plaintiff receives timely payment from her uninsured motorist carrier. Bradley v. H.A. Manosh Corp., 157 Vt. 477, 601 A.2d 978 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        The 1983 amendment to subsec. (c) of this section applied only to those policies that were actually new or renewed after the effective date of the amendment, July 1, 1983; the amendment did not apply to all insurance policies then in force. Brunet v. American Insurance Co.,, 660 F. Supp. 843 (D. Vt. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        The language of this section extends coverage to insured persons wherever they may be, provided that they are injured by an uninsured motorist. Sanders v. St. Paul Mercury Insurance Co., 148 Vt. 496, 536 A.2d 914 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section neither promotes nor prohibits stacking of uninsured motorist coverage. Sanders v. St. Paul Mercury Insurance Co., 148 Vt. 496, 536 A.2d 914 (1987).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Court does not read the uninsured/underinsured motorist statute to require an insurer effectively to provide "double liability insurance"; a concept that the court rejected in Hubbard, and an approach that has been uniformly rejected by other courts; this interpretation is consistent with the purpose of the law, with Hubbard, and with the conclusions reached by courts in other states. Thus, a passenger involved in a single-car accident who was not fully compensated under the host-vehicle policy's liability coverage because of the number of victims was not entitled to recover both liability and UIM benefits under the policy, which contained "owned-vehicle" and "covered-auto" exclusions. Progressive Cas. Ins. Co. v. MMG Ins. Co., 197 Vt. 253, 103 A.3d 899 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        Uninsured motorist statute did not apply to a policy that was issued and delivered not in Vermont, but to a Massachusetts company with its principal place of business in Massachusetts. The fact that the car in question, which the company provided to an employee, was garaged at the employee's house in Vermont did not mean that the statute applied. McGoff v. Acadia Ins. Co., 190 Vt. 612, 30 A.3d 680 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        On its face, the uninsured motorist statute limits the application of its requirements to policies "delivered or issued for delivery in this state." McGoff v. Acadia Ins. Co., 190 Vt. 612, 30 A.3d 680 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Uninsured motorist statute limits application of the statute to policies "delivered or issued for delivery in this state with respect to any motor vehicle registered or principally garaged in this state." The two key phrases are connected by the term "with respect to" and thus are conjunctive rather than disjunctive, thereby requiring both elements to be satisfied for the statute to apply. McGoff v. Acadia Ins. Co., 190 Vt. 612, 30 A.3d 680 (2011).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Financial responsibility laws are separate from an insurer's obligation to cover insureds wherever they become victims of an uninsured or underinsured motorist. Thus, a passenger who was injured while riding in his own uninsured vehicle was entitled to uninsured motorist coverage. Progressive Ins. Co. v. Brown, 184 Vt. 388, 966 A.2d 666 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the tortfeasor's liability coverage exceeded the UIM coverage provided to the injured insured by plaintiff, he did not fall into the statutory definition of underinsured and, despite the fact that defendant actually recovered less than the limit of UIM coverage provided by plaintiff, he was not entitled to UIM benefits. Concord Gen. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Estate of Lawton, 175 Vt. 475, 820 A.2d 196 (mem.) (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        The exclusivity provision of the workers' compensation statute does not bar recovery for underinsured motorists' (UIM) benefits from a self-insured employer because, as an employer, the company is also an insurer bound to provide UIM coverage on its motor vehicles and, when the employee seeks UIM payments from the employer, the employee is enforcing the employer's statutory obligation to provide UIM coverage irrespective of the method of insurance. Colwell v. Allstate Insurance Co., 175 Vt. 61, 819 A.2d 727 (2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vermont law does not allow insurers to condition uninsured motorist/underinsured motorist coverage on location of insured, nor on insured's status as motorist, passenger in private or public vehicle, or as pedestrian. Monteith v. Jefferson Insurance Co., 159 Vt. 378, 618 A.2d 488 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where policy limit for personal injury liability, $20,000, was not less than the $20,000 limit of uninsured motorist coverage, plaintiff who was passenger in vehicle involved in one-car accident was not entitled to recover under defendant's uninsured motorist coverage; vehicle was not underinsured. Stanhope v. Lumbermens Mutual Insurance Co., 155 Vt. 645, 582 A.2d 150 (mem.) (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Before an insured can recover under this section, he must establish only his right to recovery from the uninsured or hit-and-run motorist. Rhault v. Tsagarakos, 361 F. Supp. 202 (D. Vt. 1973).

       <p>
        Where a self-insurer provided a decedent with underinsured motorist (UIM) coverage pursuant to 23 V.S.A.
        §
        941, the UIM coverage did not include punitive damages that would have been assessed against a third party who caused a car accident in which the decedent was killed; thus, evidence of the third party's intoxication was irrelevant in the UIM dispute between the self-insurer and the decedent's estate. Pecor v. Elrac, Inc., - F. Supp. 2d - (D. Vt. July 11, 2003).
       </p>
       <p>
        Amount motorist was entitled to receive from uninsured-underinsured motorist insurer under "offset reduction" clause of uninsured motorist policy, which allowed reduction of "any amounts otherwise payable for damages," was difference between amount recovered from tortfeasor or his insurer and liability limit in policy declarations, not difference between amount recovered from tortfeasor or his insurer and actual amount of insured's damages. Webb v. United States Fidelity & Guaranty Co., 158 Vt. 137, 605 A.2d 1344 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not require that an insured receive the benefits he or she is entitled to under the uninsured motorist provision of his or her policy absent a deduction for reasonable costs incurred in obtaining those benefits. Preziose v. Lumbermen's Mutual Casualty Co., 152 Vt. 604, 568 A.2d 397 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        The definition in subsec. (f) of this section makes clear that underinsurance protection only applies to the amount by which the tortfeasor actually is underinsured; it does not apply to the amount by which his coverage differs from plaintiff's total damages or from plaintiff's other insurance coverages. Brunet v. American Insurance Co.,, 660 F. Supp. 843 (D. Vt. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where plaintiff was injured when uninsured motorist drove his car into her parents' home, where she resided, and plaintiff and her father each owned an automobile covered by separate insurance policy issued by defendant insurance company, father's policy covering plaintiff as to uninsured motorists, and each policy providing for the minimum $10,000 amount of uninsured motorist coverage for each person as required by this section and section 801 of this title, plaintiff could recover the statutory minimum from each policy, provided such recovery did not exceed the amount of her actual loss. Goodrich v. Lumbermens Mutual Casualty Co., 423 F. Supp. 838 (D. Vt. 1976).
       </p>
       <p>
        Once the policyholder has established the liability of the uninsured motorist, and has established his damages, the company's undertaking is to pay the policyholder as much of the judgment as can be satisfied within the limit specified in the uninsured motorist clause. Rhault v. Tsagarakos, 361 F. Supp. 202 (D. Vt. 1973).
       </p>
       <p>
        If an insured's injury exceeds the limit specified in the uninsured motorist clause he must look elsewhere for further recovery. Rhault v. Tsagarakos, 361 F. Supp. 202 (D. Vt. 1973).

       <p>
        Definition of "uninsured motor vehicle" that excluded any vehicle owned by the insured or a relative was unenforceable under the uninsured motorist (UM) statute. Thus, a passenger who was injured while riding in his own uninsured vehicle, which he had allowed a friend to drive, was entitled to UM coverage. Progressive Ins. Co. v. Brown, 184 Vt. 388, 966 A.2d 666 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Owned-vehicle exclusion meant only that an insured could not recover under both the liability portion and the uninsured/underinsured (UM/UIM) portion of the same contract, and such an exclusion was not at all inconsistent with the UM/UIM statute where the driver's liability and the insured passenger's UM/UIM coverages under the same policy were equivalent. Since no gap in coverage could occur, the statute's purpose was neither defeated nor impinged upon by enforcement of the exclusion. Hubbard v. Metro. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 182 Vt. 501, 944 A.2d 891 (Nov. 2, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any limit on uninsured motorist coverage may not reduce the recovery which would have been available to the insured had the tortfeasor purchased insurance with the same (or greater) limits as the insured. Feeley v. Allstate Insurance Co., 178 Vt. 642, 882 A.2d 1230 (mem.) (August 17, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Policy provision giving the insurance company the right to reduce its obligation under uninsured motorist coverage by "all amounts payable under any workers' compensation law" is unenforceable. Feeley v. Allstate Insurance Co., 178 Vt. 642, 882 A.2d 1230 (mem.) (August 17, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff did not qualify as an "insured" under a policy held by his mother's domestic partner as the "named insured." Congdon v. Automobile Club Ins. Co., 174 Vt. 586, 816 A.2d 504 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Policy provisions that merely establish priority of coverage among insurers without compromising coverage for insureds do not violate uninsured motorist statute, and thus a provision labeling uninsured motorist coverage as excess does not, in and of itself, violate Vermont law mandating such coverage. State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance Co. v. Powers, 169 Vt. 230, 732 A.2d 730 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        In dispute involving multiple uninsured motorist carriers, insurer whose policyholder was owner/operator of vehicle in which plaintiff was injured was primary insurer and was required to exhaust its policy limit before excess coverage of other insurers was tapped; where insurers' respective policy provisions unambiguously established a consistent method for prioritizing uninsured motorist coverage, court would honor that method because it neither reduced coverage to insured nor violated statutory law or public policy. State Farm Mutual Auto Insurance Co. v. Powers, 169 Vt. 230, 732 A.2d 730 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        In an action by decedent's estate to recover uninsured motorist benefits under a business automobile insurance policy covering a company car assigned to the decedent's mother, summary judgment for the insurer was not appropriate because the definition of "named insured" was ambiguous in the context of the family-oriented language of the contract. Lunge v. National Casualty Co.,, 977 F. Supp. 672 (D. Vt. 1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Insurance policy clause, which denied uninsured motorist coverage for accidents in which insured motorists were injured while occupying vehicles they owned but had not insured, was inconsistent with Vermont law and unenforceable. Monteith v. Jefferson Insurance Co., 159 Vt. 378, 618 A.2d 488 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Interpolicy, anti-stacking insurance provisions dealing with underinsured motorists violate this section's language and underlying purpose. Monteith v. Jefferson Insurance Co., 159 Vt. 378, 618 A.2d 488 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Clause in automobile insurance policy requiring insurer's written consent to insured's settlement with uninsured motorist was enforceable under this section. Travelers Indemnity Co. v. Eitapence, 924 F.2d 48 (2d Cir. 1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section did not require payment for wife's loss of consortium above and beyond what insurer already paid for husband's injuries, under motor vehicle policy limiting bodily injury liability to $20,000 "for all damages sustained because of the injury to one person." Whitney v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., 151 Vt. 510, 562 A.2d 467 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section requires every policy to have a minimum uninsured motorist coverage, rather than requiring every injury to be covered to a minimum level; therefore, an individual policy may not avoid the minimum statutory requirements by comparing its coverage with other insurance coverage an insured might have. Brunet v. American Insurance Co.,, 660 F. Supp. 843 (D. Vt. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        "Anti-stacking" and "excess-escape other insurance" clauses in a personal automobile policy, which permitted the insurer to reduce its liability from the face amount of the uninsured motorist coverage in the policy, were invalid since they violated the minimum statutory requirements for uninsured motorist coverage, which requires and makes the insurer liable for up to the full face amount of its uninsured motorist coverage on each policy. Brunet v. American Insurance Co.,, 660 F. Supp. 843 (D. Vt. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        If a clause in one automobile insurance policy vitiates the uninsured motorist coverage provided in another policy, the latter becomes, in effect, a policy without protection against uninsured motorists in violation of this section.

        Where plaintiff was injured when uninsured motorist drove his car into her parents' home, where she resided, and plaintiff and her father each owned an automobile covered by separate insurance policy issued by defendant insurance company, father's policy covering plaintiff as to uninsured motorists, and each policy providing for the minimum $ 10,000 amount of uninsured motorist coverage for each person as required by this section and section 801 of this title, "excess-escape" and "pro-rata" clauses in each policy, providing for payment less than that provided for by policy if other insurance applied, were repugnant to this section and invalid to extent that they purported to deny recovery for actual loss up to $ 20,000; if plaintiff's actual losses were found to be less than $ 20,000, the "pro-rata" clauses could be given effect for sole purpose of pro-rating loss between two policies to avoid "double recovery."

       <p>
        Subsec. (e) of this section applies only to payments a plaintiff receives from the uninsured motorist; it does not provide for reduction in uninsured motorist coverage for payments received from an insured third-party motorist.

        Where plaintiff's sustained injuries when the car in which they were passengers collided with an car driven by an uninsured motorist, once plaintiffs established that they were legally entitled to recover from the uninsured motorist, their host driver's insurer stood jointly liable with the uninsured motorist, or in his stead, up to the policy limits provided, and trial court properly refused to give effect to policy terms which provided for a reduction in uninsured motorist recovery by the amount recovered under liability coverage. Muir v. Hartford Accident & Indemnity Co., 147 Vt. 590, 522 A.2d 236 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under subsecs. (e) and (f) of this section, payments by the tortfeasor must be subtracted from the total of the plaintiff's uninsured motorist policies and the remaining uninsured motorist liability must be apportioned pro rata among such policies. Brunet v. American Insurance Co., 660 F. Supp. 843 (D. Vt. 1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any payments made by an insurer under uninsured motorist coverage in a personal automobile policy should be reduced by any amount paid under the insured's workers' compensation payments to the insured; taken together, uninsured motorist and workers' compensation payments cannot add up to more than the insured's total damages.

         7. Reimbursement of carrier.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Summary judgment was granted to insurer one on its claim against insurer two to recover a portion of underinsured motorist's coverage that insurer one had paid to insureds because the two insurers were excess insurers, and thus each had to pay a pro rata share to be consistent with public policy under 23 VSA
        §
        941(a). Wittik v. State Farm Ins. Cos., - F. Supp. 2d - (D. Vt. Jan. 12, 2004), affirmed by Wittik v. State Farm Ins. Co., 142 Fed. Appx. 525 (2d Cir. Vt., July 19, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        The obligation of an uninsured motorist carrier is to provide uninsured motorist coverage up to the limits of its policy, for the portion of the accident victim's total judgment that is unsatisfied by recovery from other sources; an uninsured motorist carrier is therefore entitled to reimbursement for payments it makes to an accident victim to the extent the victim's total recovery from all sources exceeds his or her damages. Bradley v. H.A. Manosh Corp., 157 Vt. 477, 601 A.2d 978 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Tortfeasors jointly liable with an uninsured motorist may not reduce their liability by the amount of payments made under uninsured motorist coverage because any potential windfall to the plaintiff will instead pass through to the uninsured motorist carrier as reimbursement for payments already made. Bradley v. H.A. Manosh Corp., 157 Vt. 477, 601 A.2d 978 (1991).

       <p>
        Where plaintiff was injured at defendant's maintenance garage when an automobile defendant's off-duty uninsured employee was repairing crushed her leg, and plaintiff was covered by an uninsured motorist policy, the uninsured motorist carrier was properly reimbursed from a tortfeasor jointly liable with the uninsured motorist to the extent that the award of damages from the tortfeasor combined with the uninsured motorist coverage exceeded plaintiff's total damages.

         8. Purpose.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Ultimate purpose of the uninsured/underinsured motorist (UM/UIM) statute, to guarantee the $200,000 protection purchased by plaintiffs, was satisfied by granting summary judgment for defendant. After receiving a $100,000 liability payment and a $100,000 UM/UIM payment, plaintiffs would be in the same position as if the UM/UIM driver's auto insurance carried the same amount of liability coverage as the UM/UIM coverage purchased by plaintiffs. Hubbard v. Metro. Prop. & Cas. Ins. Co., 182 Vt. 501, 944 A.2d 891 (Nov. 2, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        The burden of proof is properly on the insurer to show that the insured made a knowing rejection of higher uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage; a lesser requirement would be entirely inconsistent with the broad remedial purpose of the uninsured motorist statute. Lecours v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., 163 Vt. 157, 657 A.2d 177 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The purpose of this section is to benefit an insured who has provided protection for others to obtain protection himself; neither this section nor the policy behind it is designed for the benefit of the uninsured motorist. Bradley v. H.A. Manosh Corp., 157 Vt. 477, 601 A.2d 978 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section was designed to insure the victim of an underinsured motorist a statutory minimum coverage equal to that of the victim of an uninsured motorist. Brunet v. American Insurance Co.,, 660 F. Supp. 843 (D. Vt. 1987).

        Arbitration of a claim made under uninsured motorist provision of plaintiffs' automobile insurance policy did not contravene this section; procedural formalities associated with a trial are not guaranteed by this section. Preziose v. Lumbermen's Mutual Casualty Co., 152 Vt. 604, 568 A.2d 397 (1989).

         10. Lowering amount of coverage.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Original policyholder's written consent to have UM/UIM limits lower than his liability limits did not excuse insurer's obligation to seek specific instruction regarding lowered UM/UIM limits from plaintiff's mother at time she became an additional named policyholder. Dusharm v. Nationwide Insurance Co., 92 F. Supp. 2d 353 (D. Vt. 2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because this section does not create "separate and distinct" categories of coverage for uninsured and underinsured motorists, waivers of the statutory limits in subsec. (c) do not have to be separate for uninsured and underinsured coverages. The insurance carrier may require that the insured choose one "uninsured motorist" limit for uninsured and underinsured (and hit-and-run) motorist coverage. Merkel v. Nationwide Insurance Co., 166 Vt. 311, 693 A.2d 706 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any waiver of uninsured-motorist coverage in an initial insurance policy is extended to the renewal policy. Subsec. (c) does not require a new direction to set uninsured motorist coverage limits at each policy renewal. The specific mention of "renewed policies" in this provision, which language was added in 1983, was to provide an effective date for the requirements of the section and not to require a new direction at each policy renewal. Merkel v. Nationwide Insurance Co., 166 Vt. 311, 693 A.2d 706 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to show that insured's decision to lower coverage was informed and voluntary where insurance agent testified that insured requested that uninsured motorist (UM) coverage be lowered and insured's premium payment omitting earlier, higher UM coverage premium corroborated agent's testimony. Lecours v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., 163 Vt. 157, 657 A.2d 177 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court would not infer requirement that for a reduction in uninsured motorist coverage to be effective under 23 V.S.A.
        §
        941(c) it must be in writing. Lecours v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., 163 Vt. 157, 657 A.2d 177 (1995).

         11. Insurer's duty to inform.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Regardless of what the insurance agents understand about uninsured motorist (UM) statute, the most that can be inferred from the statutory language is that the insured must know that there are options with respect to UM coverage and that the default option is coverage consistent with liability coverage; no other explanation, such as the legislative purpose or advice as to whether to comply with that purpose, is required of the insurance company to make the insured's voluntary election for lower limits more knowing. Lecours v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., 163 Vt. 157, 657 A.2d 177 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although the purpose of the uninsured motorist statute is to encourage drivers to recognize that it is in their interest to adequately insure themselves against the risk of an accident with an uninsured motorist and although insured argued that such purpose is not furthered by a narrow interpretation of the insurer's burden to inform, there is no support in the statute or the legislative history to expand the insurer's burden. Lecours v. Nationwide Mutual Insurance Co., 163 Vt. 157, 657 A.2d 177 (1995).

        An uninsured motorist carriers' right of subrogation is limited because the carrier can obtain reimbursement only after the injured party is fully compensated. Korda v. Chicago Insurance Co., 180 Vt. 173, 908 A.2d 1018 (August 4, 2006).

         13. Excess policies.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In providing clearly and unambiguously that no policy insuring against liability arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of any motor vehicle could issue without uninsured/underinsured motorist (UM/UIM) coverage, the UM/UIM statute plainly encompassed the excess policies here at issue. Both policies provided coverage for amounts in excess of the limit provided by the retained or primary policy. Insurance Co. of the State of Pennsylvania. v. Johnson, 186 Vt. 435, 987 A.2d 276 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Nothing suggests that an excess or umbrella policy which - in the precise language of the uninsured/underinsured motorist (UM/UIM) statute - provides coverage against liability "resulting from the ownership, maintenance or use of a motor vehicle" should escape the reach of the statute merely because it depends on a primary policy or covers additional types of liability. This conclusion is also consistent with the "full recovery" nature of the statute, which provides that the limits of UM/UIM coverage shall be the same as those of the insured's basic liability coverage, and with the decisions of most courts construing similar statutes. Insurance Co. of the State of Pennsylvania. v. Johnson, 186 Vt. 435, 987 A.2d 276 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Uninsured/underinsured motorist statute, by its terms, does apply to excess or umbrella policies that provide coverage against liability arising out of the ownership, maintenance, or use of a motor vehicle.

         14. Offsets.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        As long as the total uninsured/underinsured motorist coverage is offset by the liability payment, the uninsured motorist statute is satisfied. Humphrey v. Vt. Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 186 Vt. 537, 979 A.2d 452 (mem.) (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Primary uninsured/underinsured motorist insurers are entitled to offset their coverage by the full amount of a tortfeasor's liability payment; any remaining offset inures to the excess insurer's benefit. Thus, a $100,000 liability payment nullified the primary UIM coverage of $50,000 and offset the excess UIM coverage by $50,000. Humphrey v. Vt. Mut. Auto. Ins. Co., 186 Vt. 537, 979 A.2d 452 (mem.)

        1081), establishing 50-mile per hour speed limit on certain highways, and placed it squarely within the application of this section. State v. Baril, 127 Vt. 394, 250 A.2d 732 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Information charging defendant with driving on interstate highway at Middlesex on April 6, 1967, "at rate of speed in excess of the established speed limit, to wit, 65 miles per hour, contrary to regulations governing use of interstate highway" was sufficient to inform defendant of place, nature, and cause of accusation presented against him and was entirely adequate to direct him to particular statute upon which the charge was laid, without any impairment to the preparation of his defense. State v. Baril, 127 Vt. 394, 250 A.2d 732 (1969).

        Under 23 V.S.A.
        §
        1007, a town is not permitted to regulate the speed limit on a State highway. State v. Yorkey, 163 Vt. 355, 657 A.2d 1079 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The Legislature clearly intended to distinguish between towns and cities in its enactment of 23 V.S.A.
        §
        1007, the provision governing local speed limits. State v. Yorkey, 163 Vt. 355, 657 A.2d 1079 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The plain, ordinary meaning of "town" is that it is an entity that was legislatively created as a town; the distinction between a town and a city is reasonably clear, both historically and legally, and even if there are contexts in which the distinction is not relevant or important \- as where all municipalities are treated together \- in 23 V.S.A.
        §
        1007 the Legislature adopted a statute in which the distinction is clearly expressed. State v. Yorkey, 163 Vt. 355, 657 A.2d 1079 (1995).

         2. Violations.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Local speed regulations do not duplicate or contradict general statutory provisions, but rather alter them, with the result that violations of the local speed regulations become violations of the applicable statutory provision contained in this title. Meacham v. Conway, 140 Vt. 191, 435 A.2d 961 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section and section 1081 of this title, establishing the State basic speed limit, indicate a general legislative intent to bring speed limits legally established by local authorities within the ambit of this title, so that their violation would have the same status as violation of the general speed limit set up by section 1081. Meacham v. Conway, 140 Vt. 191, 435 A.2d 961 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Violations of municipal ordinances or regulations relating to vehicle speed also constitute violations of the State statutory provisions relating to vehicle speed and, being moving violations, fall within the purview of section 673a of this title, authorizing revocation of the operator's license of any person convicted of eight or more moving violations within a consecutive period of five years. Meacham v. Conway, 140 Vt. 191, 435 A.2d 961 (1981).

         3. Burden of proof.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In order to prevail in a case involving a violation of a local speed limit, the State must prove not only the fact of excessive speed, but also the content of the ordinance imposing the speed limit and that it had legal effect. State v. Page, 142 Vt. 522, 457 A.2d 653 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where at defendant's trial for violation of a local speed limit, the State introduced a certified copy of the certificate of adoption of the speed limit, which stated that the selectmen had adopted the ordinance pursuant to this section, since the plain meaning of such statement was that the requisites set forth in this section were followed, the state met its burden of proving the local ordinance, its content, and its legal authority. State v. Page, 142 Vt. 522, 457 A.2d 653 (1983).

       </h5>
       <p>
        State's failure to furnish a certified copy of applicable village ordinance establishing the speed limit at the locality where defendant was stopped for speeding did not constitute reversible error where arresting officer testified that the speed limit was 25 miles per hour. State v. Gagne, 148 Vt. 587, 535 A.2d 790 (1987).

        Sovereign immunity precluded plaintiffs' action against State for personal injuries caused by accident with police cruiser that was traveling to scene of emergency, because plaintiffs' claimed that the State was liable for the trooper's negligence, and to find an operator of an emergency vehicle liable for injuries caused while responding to an emergency call, plaintiff must show that the operator acted recklessly.

        Sufficient material facts existed to preclude grant of summary judgment on negligence claims by parents of decedent against police officers where officers knew that decedent was riding a motorcycle with a damaged front wheel at high speed, officers had no suspicion that decedent had committed a violent crime, and there was evidence that at least two of the officers knew decedent and his family, which suggested that the chase may not have been necessary to apprehend decedent, and the chase covered 25 miles and lasted nearly one-half hour.

        Provision of subsec. 1050(c) of this title stating that operators of emergency vehicles are not relieved "from the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons using the highway" does not contradict the conclusion of this section allowing operators of emergency vehicles to violate certain rules of the road when driving to the scene of an emergency. A showing of recklessness is required to hold the driver liable. Rochon v. State, 177 Vt. 144, 862 A.2d 801 (August 27, 2004).

        Where the undisputed testimony of an officer was that defendant was driving left of the center of the road, and that, although the road was wide enough for two cars to pass, it was questionable whether an oncoming car could have passed by defendant because of his position in the center of the road, given defendant's failure to stay to the right, as required by statute, the officer was justified in stopping him. State v. Doyon, 171 Vt. 546, 758 A.2d 816 (mem.) (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the case of defendant convicted of operating a motor vehicle on the left side of the road, where accident victims testified that at the time of the accident defendant's oncoming vehicle swerved into their lane as it rounded a curve while their car was well within its own lane and the investigating officer testified that the road was wide enough to permit two cars to safely pass each other, that debris from defendant's car was found at the point of impact on the left side of the road, and that a skid mark was found which began on the right side of the road, crossed the crown, and ended at the point of impact, the evidence was sufficient to support the conviction, notwithstanding the fact that the road was unpaved, unmeasured, and without a clearly marked centerline.

        Bridge did not become an "obstruction" simply because operator was driving a truck too large to fit under it, and therefore exception contained in subdiv.

        Trooper who stopped defendant for crossing the center line had a reasonable and articulable suspicion under the Fourth Amendment that defendant committed a traffic violation, as even a slight crossing was sufficient to violate the driving-to-right statute. The fact that defendant might have a defense to the traffic violation was irrelevant in that the question was whether the officer had a reasonable suspicion of a wrongdoing, not whether defendant actually committed a wrongdoing. State v. Howard, 202 Vt. 51, 147 A.3d 88 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the trial court found that defendant crossed the centerline in violation of the "drive to the right" statute, either briefly or at length, it erred as a matter of law in finding the ensuing traffic stop unlawful and in granting defendant's motion to suppress.

        Violation of this section makes a prima facie case of negligence; it gives rise to a rebuttable, rather than a conclusive, presumption of negligence and proof of attendant circumstances may, in a civil case, counterbalance or overcome the effect of this section.

        It is not the part of reasonable prudence to travel in the lane of opposing traffic especially when traveling on a winding country road. Heath v. Orlandi, 127 Vt. 204, 243 A.2d 792 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plaintiff in automobile negligence action and operator of his care were entitled to assume, though operator was aware that another vehicle was approaching, from opposite direction, covered bridge over which they were passing, that other driver would obey law and keep to right of center of highway so as to allow safe passage, and might persist in that assumption until they saw, or in exercise of reasonable care ought to have seen, that it was unwarranted. Page v. McGovern, 110 Vt. 166, 3 A.2d 543 (1939).
       </p>
       <p>
        Driver of automobile along public highway, who sees another automobile approaching on the wrong side of the road, has a right to assume that it will observe the law of the road and move over to its right so as to pass without interference, and to proceed on this assumption, until he sees, or in the circumstances ought to see, that it is unwarranted. Hatch v. Daniels, 96 Vt. 89, 117 A. 105 (1922).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was error to refuse defendant's request to charge that the law presumed that he reasonably turned his car to the right of the center of the traveled part of the highway so as to pass the plaintiff without interference, and that this presumption was evidence in his favor and stood with him until overcome by evidence, in view of penalty for failure to so turn to the right. Thayer v. Glynn, 93 Vt. 257, 106 A. 834 (1919).

        In action arising out of automobile-truck collision evidence that truck crossed over into automobile's lane of traffic was sufficient to create jury questions as to truck driver's negligence. Heath v. Orlandi, 127 Vt. 204, 243 A.2d 792 (1968).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether plaintiff automobile driver who collided with truck which was in his lane of traffic exercised reasonable care in entering gradual curve at speed of 25 to 30 miles per hour while hauling boat trailer was question for jury. Heath v. Orlandi, 127 Vt. 204, 243 A.2d 792 (1968).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In a case where defendant was stopped because he failed to use a turn signal when exiting a rotary, the court could not agree that any exit from any rotary was necessarily a change of direction; it was possible that in some rotaries, the entry and exit locations would be located in such proximity to each other that a vehicle could travel through the rotary without making any discernible or significant change in direction. Given this kind of possibility, and because the turn-signal statute was silent on the subject of rotaries, and the only statutory provision addressing rotaries was silent on the subject of turn signals, it was necessary for the State to demonstrate that defendant's exit off this particular rotary constituted a change of direction in order to justify the traffic stop; thus, remand for an evidentiary hearing on defendant's motion to suppress was required. State v. Harris, 186 Vt. 225, 980 A.2d 785 (2009).

        Where two motor vehicles approach intersection, the rate of speed at which vehicle from favored direction is approaching is important, if not determinative, fact in establishing right of operator of vehicle approaching from disfavored direction to enter and cross intersection ahead of other vehicle.

        When two vehicles approach an intersection in point of time and at such distance and rate of speed that collision is to be reasonably apprehended, vehicle entering from disfavored direction must give way and await passage of vehicle favored by statute.

        Vehicle about to enter an intersection from favored direction does not have exclusive right to proceed without adequate observation and regard for vehicles approaching from disfavored direction. Verchereau v. Jameson, 122 Vt. 189, 167 A.2d 521 (1961).
       </p>
       <p>
        Vehicle about to enter intersection from favored direction has right to assume, in absence of anything to the contrary, that vehicle approaching from disfavored direction would observe section and approach and enter intersection slowly and with due care to avoid accident, but the duty is reciprocal, and first vehicle is not relieved from an equal compliance with statute, and the duty is made more imperative with an increase in the hazards. Fletcher v. White, 114 Vt. 377, 45 A.2d 569 (1946); Brown v. Gallipeau, 116 Vt. 290, 75 A.2d 694 (1950); Smith v. Squire, 119 Vt. 59, 118 A.2d 355 (1955).
       </p>
       <p>
        Finding that vehicle entering intersection from favored direction at 25 miles per hour on icy and slippery streets and with obstructed view did not exercise degree of care required by statute and was guilty of contributory negligence held not error. Brown v. Gallipeau, 116 Vt. 290, 75 A.2d 694 (1950).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that one vehicle has right of way over others crossing its path does not relieve vehicle thus favored from duty of exercising due care not to injure others at place of crossing. Jasmin v. Parker, 102 Vt. 405, 148 A. 874 (1930).

        Where automobile involved was within range of defendant's vision and close to intersection where accident occurred when defendant looked to right, his claim that he looked and saw no car was unavailing, since he was required to look effectively, with the care that a careful and prudent man would have exercised in like circumstances, and was presumed to have seen whatever was in range of his vision if he looked.

        Operator of motor vehicle has a duty to watch another vehicle approaching an intersection effectively, with the degree of care which a careful and prudent man would have exercised in like circumstances, and he is charged with knowledge of what he would have seen if he had looked.

        Violation of section relating to approaching intersecting highways did not establish negligence as a matter of law. Kent v. Smith, 404 F.2d 241 (2d Cir. 1968).

       <p>
        Violation of section, which provided that all intersecting highways were to be approached and entered slowly and with due care to avoid accidents, was prima facie evidence of negligence. Tolin v. Hasbrook, 116 Vt. 417, 77 A.2d 914 (1951).
       </p>

        To bar recovery plaintiff's violation of section governing right of way at intersecting highways must have been a proximate cause of accident. Lachance v. Myers, 98 Vt. 498, 129 A. 172 (1925); Kremer v. Fortin, 119 Vt. 1, 117 A.2d 245 (1955).

        Where two vehicles approach highway intersection so nearly at same time or at such rate of speed that if both proceed, each without regard to the other, collision or interference between them is reasonably to be apprehended, it is duty of vehicle approaching from disfavored direction to yield right of way to vehicle approaching from favored direction, and if under such circumstances operator of the vehicle approaching from disfavored direction fails to yield right of way, and such failure to yield is proximate cause of accident, he is guilty of actionable negligence.

       </p>
       <p>
        Although plaintiff, when approaching intersection of highways, failed to yield right of way to defendant who was approaching from right, such action was not contributory negligence as matter of law, notwithstanding provision of this section, as relative distance of vehicles from point of intersection and their relative rate of speed must be taken into account, and right of precedence at crossing given by such statute has no proper application except when vehicles on intersecting streets approach crossing so nearly at same time and at such rate of speed that if both proceed, collision or interference between them is reasonably to be apprehended.

        Provision of subsec. (c) of this section stating that operators of emergency vehicles are not relieved "from the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons using the highway" does not contradict the conclusion of section 1015 of this title allowing operators of emergency vehicles to violate certain rules of the road when driving to the scene of an emergency. A showing of recklessness is required to hold the driver liable. Rochon v. State, 177 Vt. 144, 862 A.2d 801 (August 27, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        The emergency provision of this section superseded the general right-of-way provisions of section 1054 of this title (now
        §
        1022). Simblest v. Maynard, 427 F.2d 1 (2d Cir. 1970).

        That fire truck was favored with statutory right of way did not authorize driver thereof to proceed in disregard of rights of others, but such right had to be exercised in reasonable manner in view of circumstances. Ferraro v. Earle, 105 Vt. 243, 164 A. 886 (1933).

        Where police officer observed defendant's automobile stop at an intersection, back up, and then go forward again, spinning its tires as it proceeded, State's theory that the spinning of the tires made it unsafe to proceed while the tires were in spinning motion was sound and consistent with the language of this section.

         2. Squealing tires.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        When defendant screeched his tires and revved his engine as he proceeded from a stop and turned the corner, and the road was dry and clear of snow and ice at the time, an officer could conclude that defendant's squealing of tires was intentional. It was thus reasonable for the officer to suspect that defendant did not have reasonable control of his vehicle, and the stop of defendant's vehicle therefore did not violate the Fourth Amendment and the Vermont Constitution. State v. Rutter, 189 Vt. 574, 15 A.3d 132 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Protections of the Vermont Constitution do not extend to prohibiting law enforcement officers from stopping motor vehicles where there is an objectively reasonable suspicion that a motor vehicle violation has occurred, even if in a particular situation these infractions may appear "trivial" or the officer's motivation is suspect. There was an objectively reasonable basis for stopping defendant for squealing his tires in violation of the statute applying to starting parked vehicles; therefore, defendant's argument of pretext lacked merit. State v. Rutter, 189 Vt. 574, 15 A.3d 132 (2011).

        Neither of the statutes governing turn signals contains any express exception to eliminate the requirement for use of a turn signal when a car is positioned in a turn-only lane; rather, the statutory language consistently mandates the use of a signal whenever a driver effects a turn, using the word "shall." The language of these statutes is not unclear or ambiguous. State v. Cook, 209 Vt. 98, 203 A.3d 509 (2018).
       </p>
       <p>
        Turn-signal statute provides that a signal of intention to turn right or left when required shall be given continuously during not less than the last 100 feet traveled by the vehicle before turning. The last two words, "before turning," unambiguously qualify the preceding command such that it does not apply unless a vehicle in fact turns; thus, the act of turning is an essential element of any violation of this provision. State v. Hutchins, 198 Vt. 431, 114 A.3d 906 (Feb. 6, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plain, ordinary meaning of the language of the statute regarding signals indicates that the operator of a motor vehicle must indicate an intention to turn within one hundred feet of turning regardless of traffic conditions; the "when required" proviso, by its placement in the sentence, refers to the requirement to use the signal at the intersection. Section 1064(d) requires a signal to commence at least one hundred feet before an intersection. State v. Fletcher, 187 Vt. 632, 996 A.2d 213 (mem.) (2010).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In a case where defendant was stopped because he failed to use a turn signal when exiting a rotary, the court could not agree that any exit from any rotary was necessarily a change of direction; it was possible that in some rotaries, the entry and exit locations would be located in such proximity to each other that a vehicle could travel through the rotary without making any discernible or significant change in direction. Given this kind of possibility, and because the turn-signal statute was silent on the subject of rotaries, and the only statutory provision addressing rotaries was silent on the subject of turn signals, it was necessary for the State to demonstrate that defendant's exit off this particular rotary constituted a change of direction in order to justify the traffic stop; thus, remand for an evidentiary hearing on defendant's motion to suppress was required. State v. Harris, 186 Vt. 225, 980 A.2d 785 (2009).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Although defendant here rotated his wheel, he did so to follow the natural course of a road; therefore, he did not "turn," and the turn-signal statute did not apply to him. He thus had not violated the statute, making a traffic stop illegal and requiring suppression of the evidence. State v. Hutchins, 198 Vt. 431, 114 A.3d 906 (Feb. 6, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Act of signaling and then not turning does not violate the turn-signal statute because the plain, unambiguous language of that provision makes turning an essential element of any violation. State v. Hutchins, 198 Vt. 431, 114 A.3d 906 (Feb. 6, 2015).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Based on the plain language of the statutes governing turn signals, defendant was required to signal prior to executing a right-hand turn, even though he was in a right-turn-only lane, and the officer who stopped his vehicle for failure to use a turn signal had a reasonable, articulable suspicion of wrongdoing. Furthermore, while it had been held that continuing on the natural arc of a road did not trigger the turn-signal requirement, here defendant's car changed directions from east to south when it made the right turn at the intersection, and there was no natural arc to be followed there. State v. Cook, 209 Vt. 98, 203 A.3d 509 (2018).

        Neither of the statutes governing turn signals contains any express exception to eliminate the requirement for use of a turn signal when a car is positioned in a turn-only lane; rather, the statutory language consistently mandates the use of a signal whenever a driver effects a turn, using the word "shall." The language of these statutes is not unclear or ambiguous. State v. Cook, 209 Vt. 98, 203 A.3d 509 (2018).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Based on the plain language of the statutes governing turn signals, defendant was required to signal prior to executing a right-hand turn, even though he was in a right-turn-only lane, and the officer who stopped his vehicle for failure to use a turn signal had a reasonable, articulable suspicion of wrongdoing. Furthermore, while it had been held that continuing on the natural arc of a road did not trigger the turn-signal requirement, here defendant's car changed directions from east to south when it made the right turn at the intersection, and there was no natural arc to be followed there. State v. Cook, 209 Vt. 98, 203 A.3d 509 (2018).

        Whether defendant was operating within the speed limit or was speeding was not dispositive on whether he was grossly negligent for purposes of his conviction for grossly negligent operation of a motor vehicle resulting in the death of a passenger, as he was required to operate his vehicle at a speed that was reasonable and prudent in the circumstances when going around a blind curve. State v. Cameron, 204 Vt. 52, 163 A.3d 545 (Dec. 23, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Violations of municipal ordinances or regulations relating to vehicle speed also constitute violations of this section and, being moving violations, fall within the purview of section 673a of this title, authorizing revocation of the operator's license of any person convicted of eight or more moving violations within a consecutive period of five years. Meacham v. Conway, 140 Vt. 191, 435 A.2d 961 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Local speed regulations do not duplicate or contradict the provisions of this section, but rather alter them, with the result that violations of the local speed regulations become violations of the applicable statutory provision contained in this title. Meacham v. Conway, 140 Vt. 191, 435 A.2d 961 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section and section 1007 of this title, prescribing procedures for establishment of local speed regulations, indicate a general legislative intent to bring speed limits legally established by local authorities within the ambit of this title, so that their violation would have the same status as violation of the general speed limit set up by this section. Meacham v. Conway, 140 Vt. 191, 435 A.2d 961 (1981).

         2. Evidence.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Witness's testimony was sufficient to raise an issue of negligence per se regarding violation of the speeding statute because he testified that the insured left the roadway in response to two oncoming vehicles driving nose-to-tail within foot of the centerline at an excessive rate of speed. Rotman v. Progressive Ins. Co., 955 F. Supp. 2d 272 (D. Vt. 2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where there was no evidence that plaintiff exceeded the speed limit of thirty-five miles per hour, it was an error for the court to give an instruction on the statute regarding a driver's duty not to drive "at a speed greater than is reasonable." Barber v. LaFromboise, 180 Vt. 150, 908 A.2d 436 (August 4, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the State presented a prima facie case of speeding against defendant based on the arresting officer's testimony that he had clocked defendant's vehicle, using a moving radar device in his patrol car, at sixty-one miles per hour in a fifty mile per hour zone, and defendant then undertook to present to the court, through her own testimony and that of her husband, neither of whom was an expert on radar, a series of possibilities which they claimed may have caused a malfunction in the radar device, but introduced no evidence that such possibilities did in fact cause a malfunction, the State was not required to show that a malfunction did not occur, and the trial court was not obligated to accept at face value the evidence of either defendant or her husband. State v. Murray-Miller, 143 Vt. 210, 465 A.2d 237 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant who had been convicted of speeding claimed that trial court erred in taking judicial notice of the radar device which the arresting officer had used to clock defendant's speed when evidence had been presented that indicated that potential problems with the radar were possible, since the court's rejection of that evidence did not constitute judicial notice of the accuracy of the radar device, there was no need for it to do so and the court's findings were supported by the evidence, trial court was justified in finding guilt beyond a reasonable doubt. State v. Murray-Miller, 143 Vt. 210, 465 A.2d 237 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Conviction for operating motor vehicle at a speed excessive for road conditions could not be sustained by evidence that respondent had exceeded the posted speed limit. State v. Lockerby, 135 Vt. 413, 377 A.2d 1388 (1977).
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to comply with federal regulation regarding attachment of license to radar unit did not preclude admissibility of radar data in prosecution for speeding. State v. Delaire, 127 Vt. 462, 252 A.2d 531 (1969).

       <p>
        Information alleging that defendant operated his motor vehicle on Interstate 89, at a rate of speed in excess of established speed limit of 65 miles per hour contrary to regulations governing use of interstate highway took the prosecution beyond the reach of this section and placed it squarely within the application of section 1010 of this title (now
        §
        1004), providing that Traffic Committee had exclusive authority to regulate speed limits on interstate and defense highways. State v. Baril, 127 Vt. 394, 250 A.2d 732 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        A criminal complaint based on this section, which alleged a rate of speed less than the maximum rate provided, had to specify the restricted area and the applicable speed limit as regulated by the Traffic Committee. State v. Delaire, 127 Vt. 462, 252 A.2d 531 (1969); State v. Baril, 127 Vt. 394, 250 A.2d 732 (1969).

       <p>
        Denial of acquittal was warranted with respect to a charge against defendant of grossly negligent operation of a motor vehicle resulting in the death of a passenger, as the jury could reasonably have found that he was grossly negligent for operating his vehicle around a blind corner at an intersection without extra caution because he drove in such a way that he could not control his car. State v. Cameron, 204 Vt. 52, 163 A.3d 545 (Dec. 23, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        To prove prima facie case of careless and negligent operation of motor vehicle, State was required to show that defendant disregarded a risk of death or injury of such a nature and degree that failure to perceive it, considering nature and purpose of his conduct and circumstances known to him, involved a gross deviation from standard of care a reasonable person would observe in defendant's situation. State v. Devine, 168 Vt. 566, 719 A.2d 861 (mem.) (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        The failure of a person to operate a vehicle in conformity with this section establishes a prima facie case of negligence; the burden then shifts to the party against whom the presumption operates to come forward with evidence to rebut the presumption. Duncan v. Wescott, 142 Vt. 471, 457 A.2d 277 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where in an action for negligence arising out of an accident which occurred while defendant was operating an automobile in which plaintiff was a passenger, defendant did not demonstrate that she did not violate this section and a doctor testified that with a reasonable medical certainty he could relate plaintiff's injuries to the accident, plaintiff proved negligence as a matter of law and should have been granted a directed verdict on that issue and that defendant's negligence proximately caused the accident and plaintiff's injuries. Duncan v. Wescott, 142 Vt. 471, 457 A.2d 277 (1983).

       </p>
       <p>
        A conviction for violating provision prohibiting operation of a motor vehicle in a careless or negligent manner, based on ordinary negligence, does not supply the requisite mens rea for conviction under separate provision penalizing vehicular homicide.

       <p>
        It was not harmless error to admit evidence of defendant's consumption of marijuana without the necessary expert testimony to connect it to whether defendant drove in a grossly negligent manner that caused the death of his passenger, as the jury was left to speculate as to the effect of his marijuana consumption and there is a significant likelihood that the jury was misled to the prejudice of the defendant. State v. Cameron, 204 Vt. 52, 163 A.3d 545 (Dec. 23, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was not entitled to acquittal of grossly negligent operation of a vehicle when the evidence showed that defendant chased his neighbor and passed him on a road that was barely as wide as defendant's car turned sideways, turned abruptly so that his car sat across the roadway, leaving four tire marks, and stopped just in front of the neighbor, requiring the neighbor to put on his brakes to avoid hitting defendant and defendant's car. The jury could reasonably conclude that this conduct put the neighbor at risk of injury, regardless of the neighbor's ability to stop in time to avoid a collision. State v. Putnam, 200 Vt. 257, 130 A.3d 836 (Sept. 4, 2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly denied defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal of grossly negligent operation of a motor vehicle. Defendant had aggressively closed in on two motorcycles, had pulled immediately in front of the lead motorcycle while both vehicles were traveling at a significant speed, and had suddenly and without cause decelerated. State v. Neisner, 189 Vt. 160, 16 A.3d 597 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        It was error to dismiss a charge of grossly negligent operation of a vehicle for insufficient evidence. A jury could find that defendant's decision to take her eyes off the road to look at her GPS device at a time when the risk of danger was heightened because of the presence of a bicyclist was gross negligence. State v. Carlin, 188 Vt. 602, 9 A.3d 312 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the evidence showed that defendant had an unobstructed view of the accident site for almost 400 yards, along a relatively straight stretch of road, during daylight hours, and amidst relatively light traffic, the jury could reasonably have concluded that his failure to observe and avoid striking the victim involved a gross deviation from the standard of care of a reasonable person. State v. Koch, 171 Vt. 515, 760 A.2d 505 (mem.) (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Charge of grossly negligent operation was properly dismissed for lack of a prima facie case, since defendant's inattention to pedestrian for three or four seconds, without any other indicia of negligence, was insufficient to support a conviction for grossly negligent operation. State v. Free, 170 Vt. 605, 749 A.2d 622 (mem.) (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Even assuming the sentence of eight to fifteen years imposed for careless and negligent driving under 23 V.S.A.
        §
        1091 was unprecedented, defendant, who was represented by counsel, should have known that the statute authorizes a minimum sentence of one year and a maximum sentence of fifteen years, and although defendant's trial lawyer later stated in an affidavit that he thought the chance of receiving the sentence imposed was unappreciable and that defendant entered the plea agreement without even considering the possibility, defendant's lawyer had advised defendant regarding the range of potential sentences; thus, plea of nolo contendere was entered knowingly, voluntarily, and intelligently. State v. Dove, 163 Vt. 429, 658 A.2d 936 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        A penalty is not constitutionally excessive unless it is grossly disproportionate or out of all just proportion to the offense; accordingly, defendant could not seriously challenge the Legislature's judgment in authorizing a one- to fifteen-year sentence for the crime of careless and negligent driving with serious injury resulting. State v. Dove, 163 Vt. 429, 658 A.2d 936 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court would place little significance on statistics offered by defendant in support of his contention that sentence imposed for careless and negligent driving under 23 V.S.A.
        §
        1091 was unprecedented since the statistics covered only a four-year period during which time only 21 such cases were disposed of, the statistics told nothing of the many factors considered in each case, and the statistics showed only that the minimum sentence imposed was unprecedented; in fact the maximum sentence had been imposed in one out of five recorded cases. State v. Dove, 163 Vt. 429, 658 A.2d 936 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to support conviction of careless and negligent operation of motor vehicle and leaving scene of accident, even though there was no direct evidence which served to place defendant in her car or as its driver at time of accident, as there was evidence that defendant's vehicle struck barricade, a broken part of which struck and injured a person, and that defendant continued on without stopping, rendering aid, or reporting the accident. State v. Campbell, 146 Vt. 25, 497 A.2d 375 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where at the time defendant lost control of the automobile she was driving there were no other cars in the area and there was no explanation offered by defendant or any witness as to why she lost control or why the vehicle left the road, the evidence warranted a finding that defendant operated her vehicle in such a manner as to jeopardize the safety of others in violation of this section.

       <p>
        Whether defendant was operating within the speed limit or was speeding was not dispositive on whether he was grossly negligent for purposes of his conviction for grossly negligent operation of a motor vehicle resulting in the death of a passenger, as he was required to operate his vehicle at a speed that was reasonable and prudent in the circumstances when going around a blind curve. State v. Cameron, 204 Vt. 52, 163 A.3d 545 (Dec. 23, 2016).

        Where the rate of speed of a vehicle is so great that there is a reasonable likelihood of injury to persons or property, the trier of fact may find negligence. State v. Stevens, 150 Vt. 251, 552 A.2d 410 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that defendant had experience driving at high speeds, that his automobile was built to operate safely at high speeds, and that road conditions at the time he was stopped were good with only light traffic would not prevent fact finder from concluding that defendant drove to endanger (the standard of this section before 1996 amendment) in driving at a speed of 103 miles per hour.

        §
        1091(b)," the trial court erred in advising the jury in response to a question about the charge that the grossly negligent count referred to defendant's conduct generally in operating his vehicle. State v. Aiken, 177 Vt. 566, 862 A.2d 285 (mem.) (September 23, 2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the trial court instructed the jury that the motor vehicle laws it cited were relevant to the issue of defendant's duty and whether he breached that duty and the court told the jury that if it found that plaintiffs "failed to prove negligence on the part of the defendant, then [its] deliberations are concluded," the entire jury charge reflected current Vermont law on negligence cases involving safety statutes.

       <p>
        It was plain error for the trial court to proceed against defendant on two counts of grossly negligent operation of motor vehicle. The State was required to hold defendant accountable for the injuries resulting from his actions by seeking an enhanced sentence under 23 V.S.A.
        §
        1091(b)(3), not by charging defendant with multiple violations. State v. LaBounty, 179 Vt. 199, 892 A.2d 203 (November 18, 2005).

       <p>
        Where there was evidence that defendant disregarded clear warnings that he was likely to fall asleep; indeed, he permitted himself to doze off "a couple of times" before his accident, this was plainly more than momentary inattention. A jury could find that defendant's conduct in these circumstances was a gross deviation from the care expected of a reasonable person in this situation. Accordingly, it was an error to dismiss the State's charge of grossly negligent operation of a motor vehicle, with serious injury resulting. State v. Valyou, 180 Vt. 627, 910 A.2d 922 (mem.)

         12. Restitution.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Vermont restitution statute is much narrower than restitution statutes in other jurisdictions and as such requires a direct link between the crime and the financial injury for which restitution is sought. The travel and storage expenses incurred by the decedent's family were not directly linked to the offense for which defendant was convicted, negligent operation of a motor vehicle; accordingly, there was no basis for the award of those expenses. State v. Kenvin, 191 Vt. 30, 38 A.3d 26 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Violation of the statute proscribing grossly negligent operation of a motor vehicle turns entirely on whether the driver's conduct involved a gross deviation from the care that a reasonable person would have exercised; the same conclusion follows, a fortiori, with respect to the lesser offense of negligent operation, which is defined strictly in terms of whether the defendant breached a duty to exercise ordinary care. Therefore, absent any element of injury or harm, defendant's conviction of negligent operation could not be causally linked to the decedent's death, and thus could not support a restitution award for any resulting financial loss. State v. Kenvin, 191 Vt. 30, 38 A.3d 26 (2011).

         13. Probable cause.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Defendant's arrest violated the Fourth Amendment and Vt. Const. Ch. I, Art. 11 because there was no probable cause to arrest him for negligent operation of a motor vehicle. His driving over a washed-out part of a driveway was not negligent, given that unpaved roads were commonplace in Vermont, and his speed of 25 mph did not change this conclusion since there was no evidence that his speed was excessive under the circumstances or unnecessary to traverse the washout as he did. State v. Hawkins, 193 Vt. 297, 67 A.3d 230 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        In sentencing defendant for negligent operation of a motor vehicle, the court did not exceed its broad discretion in considering the reasons for the accident and the relative contributions of defendant and the decedent to the tragedy that ensued while trying to understand defendant's character and the circumstances of the offense. These factors, all relevant to the determination of an appropriate sentence, were balanced by the court on the record and resulted in a 30-day sentence to serve well within sentencing guidelines. State v. Scott, 195 Vt. 330, 88 A.3d 1173 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        In reconsidering defendant's sentence for careless and negligent driving, the trial court did not err in finding that defendant had caused a motorcyclist's death. Nothing in the court's previous decision on appeal precluded such a finding, which was based on a review of the evidence regarding defendant's acts and the circumstances of the offense - factors within the trial court's discretion to consider. State v. Kenvin, 195 Vt. 166, 87 A.3d 454 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court was within its discretion to consider defendant's negligence and the cause of the decedent's death in designing defendant's sentence, which adhered to the statutory maximum for careless and negligent operation. State v. Kenvin, 195 Vt. 166, 87 A.3d 454 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Fact that causation is not an essential element of negligent operation of a motor vehicle does not mean evidence showing that a defendant's negligence substantially caused a death is irrelevant or improperly considered under a preponderance of evidence standard at sentencing.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In imposing its sentence for negligent operation of a motor vehicle, the sentencing court was well within its discretion when it found that defendant's negligence was a proximate cause of the accident and considered the facts of the fatality resulting from the crash, including its impact on the decedent's mother, at sentencing. The jury's decision to acquit defendant of grossly negligent operation and convict him of negligent operation did not, as a matter of law, resolve the issue of causation, and therefore could not preclude the court from doing so. State v. Scott, 195 Vt. 330, 88 A.3d 1173 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        In reconsidering defendant's sentence for careless and negligent driving, it was within the trial court's discretion to make a finding that defendant was "very negligent," even though the jury had acquitted him of grossly negligent operation, death resulting. The court's assessment of defendant's actions leading up to the motor-vehicle accident, characterized by the court as "lazy," was relevant to evaluating the appropriateness of defendant's sentence; moreover, the trial court supported this finding in its review of the circumstances of the accident and defendant's driving history. State v. Kenvin, 195 Vt. 166, 87 A.3d 454 (2013).

        Charge of operating a motor vehicle without consent of owner was improperly submitted for consideration of jury, and conviction could not stand, since it was not necessarily included within greater offense, grand larceny of automobile, with which defendant was charged. State v. Nicasio, 136 Vt. 162, 385 A.2d 1096 (1978), overruled on other grounds, State v. Savo (1981) 139 Vt. 644, 433 A.2d 292.

        The gist of the offense of taking and operating a motor vehicle without the consent of the owner is the wrongful taking and the unauthorized operation of the vehicle. State v. Bruley, 129 Vt. 124, 274 A.2d 467 (1970).

       <p>
        Actual possession of the vehicle was enough, prima facie, to sustain a charge of violating this section. State v. Bruley, 129 Vt. 124, 274 A.2d 467 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where complaining witness' ownership and custody of motor vehicle was established beyond dispute, violation of this section was complete when it was shown that the vehicle was taken from his possession and operated without his consent. State v. Bruley, 129 Vt. 124, 274 A.2d 467 (1970).

         1. Parking.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Violation of provision which prohibited person from leaving vehicle standing on traveled portion of highway in position that would interfere with traffic would not preclude recovery of damages to farm wagon left standing in highway unless offense was proximate cause of accident. Bessette v. Humiston, 121 Vt. 325, 157 A.2d 468 (1960).
       </p>
       <p>
        Term "parking," as applied to automobiles, includes not only voluntary act of leaving car on highway unattended, but also stopping car on highway, though occupied and attended, for length of time inconsistent with reasonable use of highway for purpose of travel; it does not generally include stopping at curb for purpose of taking in or letting out persons. Naylor v. Dragoon, 116 Vt. 552, 80 A.2d 600 (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        Parking on a highway so that traffic could travel in one direction only was parking so as to interfere with traffic as prohibited by this section. Naylor v. Dragoon, 116 Vt. 552, 80 A.2d 600 (1951).
       </p>
       <p>
        To "park" car means something more than mere temporary stoppage for temporary purpose. Palmer v. Marceille, 106 Vt. 500, 175 A. 31 (1934).

         2. Violation as negligence.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Mere stopping of a motor vehicle on traveled way does not constitute negligence unless this is proximate cause of resulting accident. Young v. Lamson, 121 Vt. 474, 160 A.2d 873 (1960); Smith v. Blow & Cote, Inc., 124 Vt. 64, 196 A.2d 489 (1963); Campbell v. Beede, 124 Vt. 434, 207 A.2d 236 (1965).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence that a driver was parked in such a manner as to partially obstruct the highway for a considerable length of time in the nighttime, without lights, and with no warning flares set out in the road, constituted a violation of this section, and made out a prima facie case of negligence. Smith v. Blow & Cote, Inc., 124 Vt. 64, 196 A.2d 489 (1963).
       </p>
       <p>
        Violation of this section made a prima facie case of negligence and gave rise to a rebuttable, rather than a conclusive, presumption of negligence, since proof of attendant circumstances could, in a civil case, counterbalance or overcome the effect of the statute. Farren v. McMahon, 110 Vt. 55, 1 A.2d 726 (1938); Naylor v. Dragoon, 116 Vt. 552, 80 A.2d 600 (1951).

       </p>
       <p>
        Whether truck was parked or left standing upon improved or used part of highway so as to interfere with traffic thereon in violation of this section was for jury. Palmer v. Marceille, 106 Vt. 500, 175 A. 31 (1934); Cooper v. Burnor, 170 Vt. 583, 750 A.2d 974 (mem.) (1999).

       <p>
        Reasonable care, under this section, required due care commensurate with the circumstances attending the event. Desrocher v. Perry, 123 Vt. 156, 184 A.2d 217 (1962).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section it is the duty of driver to make such use of his eyes and ears before and while backing as a careful and prudent man would make in like circumstances. Callahan v. Disorda, 111 Vt. 331, 16 A.2d 179 (1940); McKale v. Weeks, 115 Vt. 155, 55 A.2d 199 (1947); Hastings v. Soule, 118 Vt. 105, 100 A.2d 577 (1953); Roberts v.

       </p>
       <p>
        The due and reasonable care imposed by this provision on a person backing a motor vehicle was the care of a prudent man in like circumstances. Eisler v. Wilder, 108 Vt. 37, 182 A. 204 (1936), overruled on other grounds, Daniels v. Parker (1956) 119 Vt. 348, 126 A.2d 85.
       </p>
       <p>
        One backing motor vehicle across street has duty of looking for approaching vehicles before he begins to back, and of continuing to look and listen while backing. Eisler v. Wilder, 108 Vt. 37, 182 A. 204 (1936), overruled on other grounds, Daniels v. Parker (1956) 119 Vt. 348, 126 A.2d 85.
       </p>
       <p>
        It is duty of person, in backing his automobile in public highway, not only to look in all directions from which a traveler might be expected to approach him before beginning to back, but to continue looking while backing. Lee v. Donnelly, 95 Vt. 121, 113 A. 542 (1921).

     State v. Hurley,

    2015 VT 46 (March 6, 2015), the Vermont Supreme Court held that the prohibition of 23 V.S.A.

         1. Material obstruction required.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Operator of a motor vehicle violates the obstructing-windshields statute only when an object hanging behind the windshield materially obstructs the driver's view, and a traffic stop is thus impermissible unless the officer can demonstrate a reasonable, articulable suspicion that a hanging object materially obstructs the driver's view. State v. Hurley, 198 Vt. 552, 117 A.3d 433 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Determination that a hanging object must materially obstruct a driver's vision to run afoul of the obstructing-windshields statute leaves open the question of whether an object causes a material obstruction. The answer to that question would require a fact-specific inquiry; hanging objects may (or may not) constitute material obstructions depending on their size, their position relative to the driver's line of vision, and whether they are stationary or mobile. State v. Hurley, 198 Vt. 552, 117 A.3d 433 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although officer's stop of defendant for having a pine-tree-shaped air freshener suspended from his rearview mirror was based on a misapprehension of the law, i.e., that the obstructing-windshields statute prohibited the hanging of any item on the inside of a windshield without regard to whether the item materially obstructed the driver's vision, the officer's misapprehension was an objectively reasonable one under the circumstances. Therefore, the Fourth Amendment did not require exclusion of the evidence gathered from the traffic stop, and the trial court did not err in denying defendant's motion to suppress. State v. Hurley, 198 Vt. 552, 117 A.3d 433 (2015).

        The legislative purpose of this section is to prohibit drivers of motor vehicles from seeking to evade civil or criminal liability by escaping before their identity can be established, and from leaving persons injured, abandoned, and destitute of first aid or medical care. State v. Sidway, 139 Vt. 480, 431 A.2d 1237 (1981).

        Whether the judicial system ultimately determines that a defendant legally caused a motor vehicle accident or is guilty of vehicular homicide is not dispositive of whether the defendant "caused or was involved in" an accident. State v. Simpson, 160 Vt. 220, 627 A.2d 346 (1993).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The statutory duties imposed on a person "who has caused or is involved" in a motor vehicle accident apply not only to persons with actual knowledge that their conduct was the proximate cause of the accident, but also to persons with actual knowledge that their actions were a precipitating or contributing factor to the accident. State v. Simpson, 160 Vt. 220, 627 A.2d 346 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        The duty imposed upon a driver by this section in a collision is not a passive one; it requires that the driver take affirmative action by stopping to give aid and information. State v. Sidway, 139 Vt. 480, 431 A.2d 1237 (1981).

         4. Jury instructions.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Defendant was not entitled to a necessity defense instruction on the charge of leaving the scene of an accident. There was little question that defendant was driving his truck around the complaining witness's property and threatening same, thus creating any "emergency" that existed; furthermore, he had ample opportunity to inform the police of the accident and did not do so. State v. Myers, 190 Vt. 29, 26 A.3d 9 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Instruction on constructive knowledge, allowing the jury to impute to defendant knowledge that a reasonable investigation of the circumstances of the accident would reveal, was consistent with the spirit and doctrine of prior decision that a defendant could be "imputed" with knowledge that a reasonable person would have gathered from the circumstances of the accident or impact, i.e., what a reasonable evaluation of the circumstances would reveal, and did not constitute reversible error. State v. Keiser, 174 Vt. 87, 807 A.2d 378 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err by failing to affirmatively instruct the jury that it could not find defendant guilty if it found that he merely thought or suspected that he had hit (and thus injured) a person because constructive knowledge being an objective inquiry, defendant's subjective state of mind was not relevant to the inquiry. State v. Keiser, 174 Vt. 87, 807 A.2d 378 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err by failing to instruct the jury on the basis of defendant's argument that the statute should be read to require actual knowledge that an accident involved a person or property of another, separate and distinct from the element of knowledge regarding injury to such. State v. Keiser, 174 Vt. 87, 807 A.2d 378 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        After reversal of vehicular homicide conviction because charge permitted jury to convict on civil negligence standard rather than criminal negligence standard, remand for sentence reconsideration of hit-and-run conviction was necessary where sentencing hearing had focused solely on the vehicular homicide conviction. State v. Simpson, 160 Vt. 220, 627 A.2d 346 (1993).

         5. Elements of offense.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        If a defendant actually knows he was involved in an accident, and an examination of the circumstances of the accident would lead a reasonable person to conclude that a person or property had been injured, imposing criminal liability for a failure to render aid is not unreasonable. State v. Keiser, 174 Vt. 87, 807 A.2d 378 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under this section, failure either to stop and render assistance or to give the required information at a time and in a manner reasonable under the circumstances is sufficient to convict. State v. Loso, 151 Vt. 262, 559 A.2d 681 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        To prove the offense of leaving the scene of an accident, the State need only show that a person failed to stop after an accident or failed to give identification and other required information to the injured party or an enforcement officer. State v. Forcier, 162 Vt. 71, 643 A.2d 1200 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Actual knowledge on the part of the accused that he was involved in an accident is an essential element of the offense of leaving the scene of an accident. State v. Sidway, 139 Vt. 480, 431 A.2d 1237 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section requires not only knowledge of an accident, but also knowledge of resultant injury to either the person or property of another. State v. Sidway, 139 Vt. 480, 431 A.2d 1237 (1981).

        Lack of knowledge of the accident and of the resultant injury or damage is a complete defense to a violation of this section. State v. Sidway, 139 Vt. 480, 431 A.2d 1237 (1981).

         7. Evidence.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Trial court did not improperly overlook mitigating evidence or abuse its discretion in imposing sentence on the count of leaving the scene of an accident with death resulting, where defendant acknowledged that he observed an individual on the right side of the road and a parked vehicle on the left just before he swerved off the highway, and was aware of other vehicles in the vicinity. The evidence thus supported the court's finding of "a high likelihood that any impact of [defendant's] car would have an effect on the other traffic, the other vehicles and [the victim]." State v. Daley, 179 Vt. 589, 892 A.2d 244 (mem.) (January 6, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Jury verdict finding defendant guilty of leaving the scene of an accident, fatality resulting, would not be disturbed where the evidence fairly and reasonably supported a jury determination that defendant possessed either actual or constructive knowledge of injury to a person and therefore did not leave the finding of guilt uncertain or dependent on mere conjecture. State v. Keiser, 174 Vt. 87, 807 A.2d 378 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to support conviction of careless and negligent operation of motor vehicle and leaving scene of accident, even though there was no direct evidence which served to place defendant in her car or as its driver at time of accident, as there was evidence that defendant's vehicle struck barricade, a broken part of which struck and injured a person, and that defendant continued on without stopping, rendering aid, or reporting the accident. State v. Campbell, 146 Vt. 25, 497 A.2d 375 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for leaving the scene of an accident, the actual knowledge of impact required on the part of the accused may be proven either by means of direct or circumstantial evidence. State v. Sidway, 139 Vt. 480, 431 A.2d 1237 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for leaving the scene of an accident, since direct evidence of actual knowledge of impact on the part of the defendant, which is an essential element of the offense, is not normally available, the necessary knowledge may be imputed to the defendant by the use of circumstantial evidence. State v. Sidway, 139 Vt. 480, 431 A.2d 1237 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for leaving the scene of an accident, evidence of the force of the impact or, in certain circumstances, proof of an impact alone is sufficient to raise an inference of knowledge of injury on the part of the fleeing driver and to thereby permit the prosecution's case to withstand a motion for judgment of acquittal. State v. Sidway, 139 Vt. 480, 431 A.2d 1237 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        In order to prove knowledge of resultant injury or damage to person or property, an essential element of the offense of leaving the scene of an accident, the State need only show constructive knowledge on the part of the defendant; therefore, it is not necessary to show, by direct or circumstantial evidence, that the defendant had actual knowledge of any resultant injury or damage because, if an impact occurs under such circumstances that a reasonable person would anticipate injury to person or property, knowledge of that fact is imputed to the driver. State v. Sidway, 139 Vt. 480, 431 A.2d 1237 (1981).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Defendant's sentence of ten to fifteen years to serve for leaving the scene of an accident, fatality resulting, was not grossly disproportionate based on sentencing statistics spanning a roughly eleven-year period which showed that, while defendant's minimum was six years greater than the next highest minimum sentence imposed, his maximum sentence was only three years greater than the next highest maximum and, also, his to-serve sentence was five years less than the maximum penalty established by the Legislature for the offense. State v. Keiser, 174 Vt. 87, 807 A.2d 378 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Sentence of ten to fifteen years to serve for leaving the scene of an accident, fatality resulting, was not an abuse of the trial court's discretion based on its conclusions that defendant had actual knowledge that he had hit a person on the night in question; that, judging from the damage to defendant's car, it was clear to defendant the nature and extent of the accident; and that defendant nevertheless chose his own self-interest of avoiding a potential DWI charge over helping the victim who, as a result, lay on the side of the road for roughly ten hours suffering without medical attention. State v. Keiser, 174 Vt. 87, 807 A.2d 378 (2002).

        There had been no claim of surprise or prejudice where the information charging leaving the scene of an accident did not contain the word "immediately," nor could there be. The information and accompanying affidavit clearly explained the charged conduct and related it directly to the statute in question; defendant's ability to prepare his defense was in no way influenced. State v. Neisner, 189 Vt. 160, 16 A.3d 597 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Information charging leaving the scene of an accident was not insufficient under the Vermont Constitution because it did not contain the word "immediately." The plain meaning of the phrase "following the crash" and the allegation that there had been a serious injury to which defendant "did not render any assistance reasonably necessary" made clear that the State was not charging defendant with violating the statute by later driving past the scene after he had originally fled or when a trooper questioned him at his home. State v. Neisner, 189 Vt. 160, 16 A.3d 597 (2010).

    <cite class="vt-code">2007, No. 195</cite> (Adj. Sess.),
    
     §
    
    1 provides: "It is the intent of the General Assembly in this act [which amended this section] to address, among other issues, the Vermont Supreme Court's decisions in
    <i>
     State v. LaBounty,
    </i>
    2005 VT 124, and
    <i>
     State v. Martin,
    </i>
    2007 VT 96. In
    <i>
     LaBounty,
    </i>
    the Court held that if more than one person was injured, an offender could be charged with only one count of grossly negligent operation of a motor vehicle with injury resulting. Similarly, the Court held in
    <i>
     Martin
    </i>
    that if more than one person was killed, an offender could be charged with only one count of boating while intoxicated with death resulting. In this act, the General Assembly responds to
    <i>
     Martin
    </i>
    and
    <i>
     LaBounty
    </i>
    by amending several motor vehicle statutes to permit an offender to be charged with a separate count of violating the statute for each person who was killed or injured as a result of the offense."

       <p>
        The meaning of "under the influence" in subsec. (a) of this section developed in Vermont case law at a time before the use of chemical tests of any kind, and its relevance has always been to physical manifestations capable of observation by a witness and reported by testimony. State v. Carmody, 140 Vt. 631, 442 A.2d 1292 (1982).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The meaning of subsec. (a) of this section, which prohibits a person who is under the influence of intoxicating liquor from being "in actual physical control" of a vehicle, is not vague or uncertain within the constitutional strictures of the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment, since its language is sufficient to give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden. State v. Trucott, 145 Vt. 274, 487 A.2d 149 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section's provision that "a person shall not operate, attempt to operate, or be in actual physical control of any vehicle on a highway while under the influence of intoxicating liquor" is not unclear and meets the constitutional standard of a criminal statute, namely, that it must give a person of ordinary intelligence fair notice that his contemplated conduct is forbidden. State v. Stevens, 137 Vt. 473, 408 A.2d 622 (1979).

        Roadblocks to screen intoxicated drivers constitute a seizure within the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. State v. Martin, 145 Vt. 562, 496 A.2d 442 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        A warrantless seizure at a roadblock to screen intoxicated drivers is not per se illegal. State v. Martin, 145 Vt. 562, 496 A.2d 442 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Police officers conducting a roadblock to screen intoxicated drivers do not necessarily have to have a warrant, probable cause, or even a reasonable, articulable, individualized suspicion of illegal activity in order to stop a motorist on the public highway. State v. Martin, 145 Vt. 562, 496 A.2d 442 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        The constitutionality of a roadblock to screen intoxicated drivers will depend upon the reasonableness of the seizure, determined by weighing the public interest in the seizure against the degree of intrusion into personal privacy occasioned by the particular roadblock. State v. Martin, 145 Vt. 562, 496 A.2d 442 (1985).

        As a general rule, a roadblock to screen intoxicated drivers will pass constitutional muster if: (1) the initial stop and the contact between the officers in the field and the motorist involves an explanation of the nature of the roadblock and minimal detention of a nonimpaired driver; (2) the discretion of the officers in the field, as to the method to be utilized in selecting vehicles to be stopped, is carefully circumscribed by clear objective guidelines established by a high level administrative official; (3) the guidelines are followed in the operation of the roadblock; (4) approaching drivers are given adequate warning that there is a roadblock ahead; (5) the likelihood of apprehension, fear, or surprise is dispelled by a visible display of legitimate police authority at the roadblock; and (6) vehicles are stopped on a systematic nonrandom basis that shows drivers they are not being singled out for arbitrary reasons. State v. Martin, 145 Vt. 562, 496 A.2d 442 (1985).

       <p>
        Roadblocks to screen intoxicated drivers serve the public interest as a safety measure, operating as one method of detecting intoxicated drivers, and further the public interest in reducing the number of intoxicated drivers by acting as a deterrent to any person who might consider driving after drinking.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Criteria set forth by Supreme Court to be used in a balancing test to determine the reasonableness of a particular roadblock to screen intoxicated drivers are not absolute requirements, and trial courts considering those criteria in relation to the totality of the circumstances may find some of the criteria are not applicable or that additional or different criteria are equally important. State v. Martin, 145 Vt. 562, 496 A.2d 442 (1985).

        Where trial court ruled that a roadblock to screen intoxicated drivers violated defendant's Fourth Amendment rights, failure to make findings concerning the criteria suggested by the Supreme Court for determining the reasonableness of such roadblocks mandated reversal.

        In order to prove intoxication, the State need only prove that defendant had lost full control over the faculties of mind and body due to the effect of intoxicating liquor; the measure of that loss is immaterial. State v. Gray, 150 Vt. 184, 552 A.2d 1190 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence was sufficient to support DUI conviction under test of whether defendant, because of use of alcohol, had ceased to retain full control over faculties of mind; State was not required to prove that defendant lost full control of physical and mental abilities. State v. Abbott, 151 Vt. 618, 563 A.2d 640 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant who had taken codeine and consumed beer was charged with driving while under influence of intoxicating liquor under subdiv. (a)(2) of this section and not charged under subdiv. (a)(3), drug interaction was covered by offense charged so long as defendant was under influence of alcohol to some degree. State v. Frigault, 151 Vt. 537, 561 A.2d 895 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        A person is considered to be under the influence of intoxicating liquor when he or she has lost full control over the faculties of mind and body; the measure of that loss is immaterial. State v. LeBeau, 144 Vt. 315, 476 A.2d 128 (1984).

       <p>
        When ruling on a motion to suppress statements made by a defendant charged with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, finding that at the time defendant waived his constitutional rights his mental capacity was not so overborne by his alcoholic condition that he could not have been conceived to be able to comprehend such rights and make a knowing waiver thereof cited appellate review standard, applicable where the issue of competent waiver was not raised below. State v. Clark, 143 Vt. 11, 460 A.2d 449 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        When drugs other than alcohol are involved, subdiv. (a)(3) of this section requires not only that the driver be under the influence but also that the influence be to a degree which renders him incapable of driving safely. State v. Rifkin, 140 Vt. 472, 438 A.2d 1122 (1981).
       </p>
       <p>
        Instruction that if jury trying defendant charged with driving under the influence found him to have been in the slightest degree under the influence it would be enough to sustain a conviction was not error. State v. Wall, 137 Vt. 482, 408 A.2d 632 (1979), appeal denied, 444 U.S. 1060, 100 S. Ct. 993, 62 L. Ed. 2d 738 (1980).

       <p>
        In a prosecution for driving under the influence, wherein a test for alcohol content was not made, issue is whether defendant was under the influence, regardless of the amount needed to produce that state, and evidence of objective symptoms may be sufficient to convict.

        Defendant who inserted key in ignition in order to roll up windows was in "actual physical control" of vehicle, and fact that he intended to leave his car parked on street and ride with friend was irrelevant. State v. Kelton, 168 Vt. 629, 724 A.2d 452 (mem.) (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        The fact that a vehicle's occupant may have been asleep or otherwise unconscious does not prevent a finding of actual physical control within the meaning of this section. State v. Blaine, 148 Vt. 272, 531 A.2d 933 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        For purposes of determining whether defendant has "actual physical control" of a vehicle, it is not a necessary element of the offense that defendant be apprehended inside the vehicle and behind the steering wheel. State v. Stevens, 154 Vt. 614, 580 A.2d 493 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        In trial for being in control of motor vehicle on highway while under the influence, jury instruction stating that the State was required to prove defendant had the potential to operate vehicle was adequate; jury charge requiring State to prove defendant had immediate potential to operate vehicle was not required. State v. Stevens, 154 Vt. 614, 580 A.2d 493 (1990).
       </p>

        Defendant who was apprehended on an exit ramp of an interstate highway, kicking snow from under the wheels of a vehicle whose motor was running and which was straddling a snow bank and who responded in the negative to officer's inquiry as to whether there was anyone else with defendant had "actual physical control" of the vehicle for purposes of this section. State v. Stevens, 154 Vt. 614, 580 A.2d 493 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        In trial for being in control of motor vehicle on highway while under the influence, jury instruction stating that defendant could not be in "actual physical control" of vehicle if vehicle were inoperable was not required where officer who called wrecker to remove vehicle from snow bank did not attempt to move the vehicle nor did he testify at trial that the vehicle was inoperable. State v. Stevens, 154 Vt. 614, 580 A.2d 493 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Conviction of being in actual physical control of a vehicle on a highway while under the influence of intoxicating liquor under this subdivision does not require a demonstration by the State that defendant's vehicle was fully operable.

State v. Trucott, 145 Vt. 274, 487 A.2d 149 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was in "actual physical control" of a motor vehicle within meaning of this section where he was found by police with his auto in the highway and blocking one lane at 3:30 a.m., the motor was running and the taillights on, the key was in the ignition and the shift lever in "park," defendant was slumped behind the wheel either sleeping or unconscious and was roused with some effort, although there was no evidence he was touching any mechanism by which the vehicle could be controlled.

       <p>
        The trial court's rationale could have been adopted by the Legislature to prohibit driving or control of a vehicle while intoxicated wherever it occurs, but by including as an element of the offense that the operation or control occur on a "highway" and defining the term as it did, the Legislature opted for a more narrow approach. State v. McNeil, 164 Vt. 129, 665 A.2d 51 (1995).

       </p>
       <p>
        Evidence that road on which defendant was travelling was an interstate highway, and that a number of vehicles were travelling on the same roadway at the time of the offense, was sufficient to allow jury to conclude that road was highway within the meaning of this section.

       <p>
        Evidence that road where defendant drove while under the influence of intoxicating liquor was maintained and plowed by town and provided secondary access to store and school supported trial court's finding that road was open to general circulation of public and, therefore, a highway, even though road was privately owned and "no trespassing" and "private drive" signs indicated exclusion of public.

        No reasonable officer could have found arguable probable cause under the Fourth Amendment to arrest a driver for a violation of this section solely based on the video and audio of the field sobriety tests (FST) as the two clues in the FST were minimal, the driver's performance was otherwise satisfactory, and all remaining evidence tending to show probable cause was disputed; the arrest was the officer's first DUI arrest and he was motivated to arrest the driver to complete his field training, and the jury could conclude that he unreasonably exaggerated the minimal flaws in the driver's performance on the FST and determine that there was no probable cause for the driver's arrest upon which to base qualified immunity for the officer. Sakoc v. Carlson, 656 Fed. Appx. 573 (2d Cir. Aug. 24, 2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Any error by the trial court in finding that probable cause existed for defendant's arrest existed before a preliminary breath test was administered was harmless. Considering defendant's poor performance in field sobriety exercises, there was no question that a trooper had probable cause to arrest after the administration of the field-sobriety tests; thus, the trial court's statement that probable cause also existed earlier during the encounter between the trooper and defendant did not change the outcome - either way, the trooper had probable cause to make the arrest when he did. State v. McGuigan, 184 Vt. 441, 965 A.2d 511 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because defendant was not under arrest for a violation of this section when he was detained by customs inspector for secondary inspection at border crossing, there was no violation of the requirement that the inspector have prior certification giving him the power of arrest, and, therefore, the trial court properly denied defendant's motion to suppress evidence secured pertinent to his subsequent arrest at the port of entry by a State Police officer.

        To arrest, without a warrant, for public intoxication, the additional element of disturbing the public or domestic peace and tranquility must be present; and where the facts and law in evidence did not warrant such a conclusion, court would not rule that police officers who saw apparently intoxicated individual had the authority and duty to prevent him from entering and operating automobile, so that it could not be said that State was estopped from prosecuting the individual for driving while intoxicated. State v. Adams, 131 Vt. 413, 306 A.2d 92 (1973), overruled on other grounds, State v. Dacey (1980) 138 Vt. 491, 418 A.2d 856.

(a)(1) of this section and with operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of subdiv. (a)(2) of this section and convicted of violating subdiv. (a)(1), since the trial court's instructions to the jury clearly explained the differences between the two charges, delineated the essential elements of each charge, told the jury that if they found that defendant had violated one subdivision they need not consider whether he violated the other and that they could find defendant guilty of either charge, but not both, these instructions safeguarded the defendant from any prejudice when both violations were presented to the jury and defendant's right to due process of law was not violated by the State trying him for both violations.

        Where this section provided that "a person may not operate, attempt to operate or be in actual physical control of any vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor," it was not a substantial defect for the complaint to omit an allegation that operation was on a public highway; therefore, instruction that jury must find that operation was on a public highway was overly restrictive in appellant's favor and he could point to no prejudice arising from the fact that the complaint did not allege operation on a public highway. State v. McGrail, 134 Vt. 91, 353 A.2d 342 (1976).

        Where information charged defendant with operating an automobile on a public highway with a blood alcohol content of .15 percent and chemical analysis of defendant's breath sample showed a .149 percent blood alcohol content, the variance was immaterial and not prejudicial, since the chemical analysis established a blood alcohol content greater than the level prohibited by subdiv. (a)(1) of this section. State v. Lamelle, 133 Vt. 378, 340 A.2d 49 (1975).

        Subsec. (f) of this section provides an affirmative defense that excuses the offense of operating a vehicle while intoxicated under certain factual circumstances. Because the subsection specifies that it provides an affirmative defense, defendant bears the burden of establishing a prima facie case on the statutory elements. State v.

       </p>
       <p>
        At trial for driving while intoxicated, where there were no concessions made by defendant's counsel of any elements of the offense, it was incumbent upon the State to prove beyond a reasonable doubt all three elements of the crime: (1) operation of a motor vehicle; (2) on a public highway; (3) while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.

        Suppression of defendant's statements about his alcohol consumption had no bearing on the outcome of his case because other evidence, including the result of a preliminary breath test and a trooper's observations, was sufficient to support the trooper's decision to arrest defendant for driving under the influence. Thus, any potential error under the Fifth Amendment and the Vermont Constitution was harmless. State v. McGuigan, 184 Vt. 441, 965 A.2d 511 (2008).
       </p>
       <p>
        When at a criminal trial for driving under the influence, a defendant objects to the admission of testimony a defendant has given at his or her civil suspension merits hearing, the defendant must meet the initial burden of producing evidence that the testimony was in fact provided by the defendant at the civil suspension hearing. Once this is established, if the evidence is to be admitted, the prosecution must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the testimony was not provided by the defendant at his or her civil suspension hearing. State v. Neumann, 183 Vt. 1, 944 A.2d 228 (Nov. 21, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        When a driving-under-the-influence defendant objects to the admission of evidence which the defendant contends is the fruit of his or her civil suspension testimony, the defendant must meet the burden of producing evidence of a relationship between the defendant's civil suspension hearing testimony and the alleged derivative evidence to which the defendant has objected. Once this prima facie showing has been made, the objection must be sustained unless the prosecution proves by a preponderance of the evidence the lack of any impermissible relationship between the testimony at the suspension hearing and the evidence offered in the criminal proceeding, and that the evidence offered in the criminal proceeding has a source independent of the suspension hearing testimony; to facilitate this procedure, the defendant should timely file a motion in limine to identify for the court any such issue about which the defendant is aware sufficiently in advance of trial so as to avoid unnecessary delay in the criminal proceeding. State v. Neumann, 183 Vt. 1, 944 A.2d 228 (Nov. 21, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        When defendant at his trial for driving under the influence of alcohol had failed to make any claim regarding the specific use, either direct or derived, of immunized testimony derived from his civil suspension hearing, there was no reason to reverse his conviction. The trial court took appropriate steps to ensure that defendant enjoyed the full extent of this immunity, and defendant had not alleged any actual use of immunized testimony, which was all that the civil suspension immunity statute prohibited. State v. Neumann, 183 Vt. 1, 944 A.2d 228 (Nov. 21, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        The State is entitled to use evidence of defendants' refusals in a prosecution for criminal refusal without violating the general Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. State v. Morale, 174 Vt. 213, 811 A.2d 185 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecutions for criminal refusal, Miranda's protections did not apply to evidence of defendants' refusal to submit to breath tests, and thus their rights were not violated. State v. Morale, 174 Vt. 213, 811 A.2d 185 (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor in violation of subdiv. (a)(2) of this section, the trial court abused its discretion by prohibiting defense counsel from questioning the State's expert on the variability of partition ratios; that is, the potential variability among different persons at different times in the conversion rate between their breath-alcohol and blood-alcohol concentration. State v. Hanks, 172 Vt. 93, 772 A.2d 1087 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because defendant was charged with driving while under the influence in violation of subdiv. (a)(2) of this section, rather than driving with an alcohol concentration exceeding the statutory limit, admitting scientifically accepted evidence concerning the variability of partition ratios would not negate a statutory offense or even an element of a statutory offense; rather, it would merely allow defendant to challenge the permissive inference and the State's charge that he was impaired. State v. Hanks, 172 Vt. 93, 772 A.2d 1087 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for driving under the influence in violation of subdiv. (a)(2) of this section, trial court's limitation of relevant and potentially exculpatory testimony concerning the variability of partition ratios could not be deemed harmless. State v. Hanks, 172 Vt. 93, 772 A.2d 1087 (2001).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court at trial for driving under the influence did not err in admitting results of Datamaster infrared breath test which showed defendant's blood alcohol content, where defendant conceded at trial that he had been under the influence, and there was thus no perceivable prejudice to defendant from the Datamaster results. State v. Lamb, 168 Vt. 194, 720 A.2d 1101 (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Testimony of police officer who had been at scene of accident that defendant was intoxicated was sufficient to prove defendant's guilt beyond reasonable doubt, and whether defendant's breath test should have been suppressed became irrelevant once the trial court convicted him under subdiv. (a)(2) of this section. State v. Bedell, 151 Vt. 14, 556 A.2d 101 (1989).

       <p>
        At trial for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor, officer could testify as to defendant's behavior and demeanor during routine questioning for booking; because the questioning was not of an incriminatory nature, it was not subject to Fifth Amendment privilege.

       <p>
        At trial for being in actual physical control of motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, the trial court's error, if any, in admitting evidence that defendant refused to submit to alco-sensor test was harmless where it was clear beyond a reasonable doubt that the jury would have rendered a verdict of guilty absent the offending evidence. State v. Curavoo, 156 Vt. 72, 587 A.2d 963 (1991).

        There is no restriction imposed by subdiv.

        Testimony that a person was under the influence of intoxicating liquor is admissible and is not a legal conclusion or an invasion of the province of the jury in its determination of the ultimate issue. State v. Norton, 134 Vt. 100, 353 A.2d 324 (1976).

        For results of breath test of driver suspected of being under the influence to be admissible, the chain of custody need not be perfectly established; the circumstances need only establish reasonable assurance of the identity of the sample. State v. Stevens, 137 Vt. 473, 408 A.2d 622 (1979); State v. Comstock, 145 Vt. 503, 494 A.2d 135 (1985).

        Where sample of defendant's breath arrived at the State Laboratory for analysis in the same condition it was in when the police officer who administered the test prepared it for mailing and there was no evidence of tampering with, change in, or confusion of the sample during the mailing, the chain of custody was sufficiently established at defendant's trial for driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor.

       <p>
        In driving while intoxicated prosecution, where police officer who had taken defendant's breath sample gave testimony sufficiently establishing chain of custody of the breath sample from officer to police station to chemist to trial, the breath sample and results of chemist's test of it were properly placed before the jury accompanied by instruction directing jury to decide reliability of the test results, despite the fact that an identifying number had been changed on the exhibit, the chemist stating he had discovered he had assigned the wrong number to it and had changed it as the number originally assigned to it related to another person's analysis.

        Although the trial court in a driving-under-the-influence case had good reasons for questioning the validity of the State's retrograde extrapolation analysis based on the lack of evidence about defendant's eating and drinking patterns, the trial court's concerns related to the proper weight to be afforded the evidence, not whether the evidence was admissible in the first place.

         34. Aiding in commission of DUI.

       <p>
        A person who aids in the commission of the offense of driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol may be held criminally liable for the acts of the principal. State v. Millette, 173 Vt. 596, 795 A.2d 1182 (mem.) (2002).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Without a challenge to the trial court's findings that defendant was not ordered to submit to a preliminary breath test or field sobriety tests - or further factual development at the hearing, such as testimony from defendant indicating that he was coerced to participate against his will - the court rejected defendant's argument that circumstances amounting to no more than a classically mundane police encounter rendered his participation involuntary.

         36. Reasonable suspicion.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Regardless of whether speeding in a snowstorm or being slow to pull over could properly be considered factors in the analysis, or whether the trooper could also properly consider the unopened bottles of beer in places such as defendant's jacket pocket and the center console, the factors of an odor of alcohol, defendant's admission to drinking, and the appearance of watery eyes were sufficient indicia of driving under the influence to validate an order for defendant to exit his vehicle. State v. Burgess, 188 Vt. 235, 5 A.3d 911 (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court could not affirm the trial court's conclusion that a trooper's suspicion of driving under the influence became unreasonable for the sole reason that defendant passed two field sobriety tests; rather, the trooper was still faced with a situation in which defendant smelled of alcohol, had watery and bloodshot eyes, and admitted to drinking alcohol. The trooper testified that his training and experience suggested that the first two factors indicated possible impairment, and the third required no such training or experience to militate in favor of further investigation. State v. Mara, 186 Vt. 389, 987 A.2d 939 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although defendant's performance on walk-and-turn and one-leg-stand tests might not, by itself, have supported a reasonable suspicion of driving under the influence, it also did not as a matter of law compel a trooper to cease his roadside investigation. Although defendant did not "fail" the tests, his performance was not flawless, and the officer did not have to evaluate the test results in a binary fashion. State v. Mara, 186 Vt. 389, 987 A.2d 939 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trooper's decision to administer a preliminary breath test (PBT) to defendant rather than allow him to continue driving when defendant smelled of alcohol, admitted to drinking, and had bloodshot eyes was premised on a reasonable suspicion of driving under the influence (DUI), imposed a minimal intrusion on defendant's liberty, and was aimed at preventing serious danger to the public; it did not violate either the Vermont or the United States Constitution. The results of the PBT, in turn, provided probable cause to arrest defendant for DUI. State v. Mara, 186 Vt. 389, 987 A.2d 939 (2009).

       <p>
        Officer need not evaluate field sobriety test results in a binary fashion. Rather, the officer must interpret the test results based on his training and experience in light of the totality of the circumstances, and some discretion inheres in that interpretation. State v.

       </h5>
       <p>
        With regard to an evidentiary-test-refusal charge, there was no plain error as to defendant's claim that a request for a test was not reasonable because an officer interfered with his right to consult with an attorney. Although the officer made no attempt to contact the specific lawyer defendant mentioned, he asked defendant if he would like to speak with a public defender, and defendant declined. State v. Perley, 200 Vt. 84, 129 A.3d 93 (2015).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Term "reasonable grounds" in the evidentiary-test refusal provision is akin to probable cause. The purpose of the "reasonable grounds" language is simply to require that a certain amount of evidence exist before an officer may take a breath test. State v. Perley, 200 Vt. 84, 129 A.3d 93 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        With regard to a charge of refusing an evidentiary test, there was sufficient evidence to allow the jury to conclude that the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that defendant had been driving under the influence of alcohol. The officer knew that defendant had been involved in a car accident around noon on a day when the roads were clear and that he had fled the scene; defendant showed signs of intoxication at the time the officer found him in his father's car a little less than two hours later; and there was no evidence of post-operation consumption. State v. Perley, 200 Vt. 84, 129 A.3d 93 (2015).

        Because a defendant can argue that consent under Vermont's implied consent law was not given voluntarily for purposes of Article 11, and the trial court here did not hold an evidentiary hearing on the issue of voluntariness after defendant raised it, erroneously deciding instead that such a challenge was precluded by the implied consent law, remand for an evidentiary hearing was required.

        The void-for-vagueness doctrine does not apply to a standardized warning read to DUI suspects. It is the statute, not the warning, that establishes the elements of the offense, and it is the statute that must fairly advise suspects of the prohibited conduct. State v. Coburn, 179 Vt. 448, 898 A.2d 128 (April 14, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because the statutory right to advisement goes above and beyond any due process requirement of statutory clarity (in that the majority of suspects receive no warning whatsoever before committing a crime, but are nonetheless held accountable to criminal sanctions prescribed in Vermont's statutes), all that is required to satisfy this right is that the warning convey the information listed in the statute. State v. Coburn, 179 Vt. 448, 898 A.2d 128 (April 14, 2006).
       </p>
       <p>
        Although it grants a right to counsel, 23 V.S.A.
        §
        1202 contains little detail about that right, and so when called upon to define the nature of the right, the courts have often looked to the public defender act, specifically 13 V.S.A.
        <span class="s1">
         §
        </span>
        5234 of that act, reasoning that 23 V.S.A.
        <span class="s1">
         §
        </span>
        1202 and 13 V.S.A.
        <span class="s1">
         §
        </span>
        5234 should be read in pari materia. State v. Fuller, 163 Vt. 523, 660 A.2d 302 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The person being processed under 23 V.S.A.
        §
        1202 must be informed of his right to consult with counsel before deciding whether to submit to a chemical test. State v. Fuller, 163 Vt. 523, 660 A.2d 302 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The rights contained in the public defender act are not directly applicable to the right in the implied consent law to consult counsel before deciding whether to take a blood-alcohol test; the public defender act implements the general right to counsel provided by the Sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution as well as Article 10 of Chapter I of the Vermont Constitution while the right to consult with counsel contained in the implied consent law is purely statutory, created by 23 V.S.A.
        §
        1202(c), and is not constitutionally mandated because the decision whether to take the breath test is not a critical stage of the prosecution. State v. Fuller, 163 Vt. 523, 660 A.2d 302 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The public defender act applies only when the defendant is detained or charged and only with respect to conditions in which a person having his own counsel would be entitled to be so represented, whereas the implied consent statute applies whenever a person is asked to take a blood-alcohol test irrespective of whether the person is detained at the time. State v. Fuller, 163 Vt. 523, 660 A.2d 302 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        13 V.S.A.
        §
        5237 states specifically that it relates only to persons informed of the right to counsel under 13 V.S.A.
        <span class="s1">
         §
        </span>
        5234 and the waiver of rights created in the public defender act, and thus by its terms the statute does not apply to rights created by the implied consent law and advice given under that law. State v. Fuller, 163 Vt. 523, 660 A.2d 302 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        A written waiver rule is not necessary to implement or safeguard the right to counsel; the court has held that oral waivers of the right to counsel are effective under Miranda, and if a constitutional right to counsel can be waived orally, it would appear that a statutory right to counsel can be so waived. State v. Fuller, 163 Vt. 523, 660 A.2d 302 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        The right to counsel provision of the implied consent law and the waiver provision of the public defender act are not to be held in pari materia, and therefore the written waiver requirement of 13 V.S.A.
        §
        5237 is inapplicable to the waiver of the right to consult counsel prior to deciding whether to take a blood-alcohol test. State v. Fuller, 163 Vt. 523, 660 A.2d 302 (1995).

        The principal purpose of this section is to encourage the availability of scientific evidence of the presence or absence of alcohol in a person's blood. State v. Lund, 144 Vt. 171, 475 A.2d 1055 (1984), overruled on grounds, State v. Dumont (1985) 146 Vt. 252, 499 A.2d 787, State v. Begins (1987) 148 Vt. 186, 531 A.2d 595.
       </p>
       <p>
        The primary purpose of the Legislature, in authorizing breath and blood tests, was to make available to law enforcement officers an alternative and more science-related aid in detecting the extent of alcohol impairment, if any, of persons suspected of DUI. State v. Begins, 148 Vt. 186, 531 A.2d 595 (1987).

        Implied consent law was meant to deal with persons operating vehicles while under the influence of liquor or drugs, promote public safety and welfare and lessen, so far as possible, the danger to the public from persons operating vehicles while under the influence of liquor or drugs, and encourage availability of scientific evidence of presence or absence of alcohol or drugs.

       <p>
        A police officer who asks a person suspected of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor to submit to a preliminary field alcohol test is not required to inquire of the motorist the state of his or her driving record, or to calculate the length of revocation of the motorist's license if there is an election not to take a test, or to inform the motorist of the latest developments in the law.

        Officers arresting driver suspected of driving while intoxicated fully explained requirements of implied consent law to driver and did all that was required of them by such law where they advised him of his rights, though not required to, read standard implied consent law form to him, asked which test he wished to take, allowed him to read form, answered request for breath test given by a doctor with answer that doctor could not give it but a State trooper would, told him he could have an additional test given by a doctor of his choice, and ended the discussion when, after breath test was set up, driver refused to take it and consistently demanded a saliva test, for which facilities were not available, which nonavailability had been explained to driver.

        Law enforcement officers are not required to offer to, or request of, DUI suspects a breath or blood test as a precondition for prosecution under section 1201(a)(2) of this title; overruling State v. Lund (1984) 144 Vt. 171, 475 A.2d 1055, to the extent of inconsistency. State v. Begins, 148 Vt. 186, 531 A.2d 595 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section mandates that whenever a State Police officer or a certified officer has reasonable grounds to believe that a person was driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, the officer must request that the suspect operator submit to testing. State v. Lund, 144 Vt. 171, 475 A.2d 1055 (1984), overruled on other grounds, State v. Dumont (1985) 146 Vt. 252, 499 A.2d 787, State v. Begins (1987) 148 Vt. 186, 531 A.2d 595.

       <p>
        Law enforcement agents not certified by the Vermont Criminal Justice Training Council to administer a breath test to a person suspected of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor do not have an obligation under this section to request a breath sample and may process suspects without requesting a sample; however, under those circumstances, a prosecution could only proceed for driving under the influence and not for driving while there is .10 percent or more alcohol in the blood. State v. Lund, 144 Vt. 171, 475 A.2d 1055 (1984), overruled on other grounds, State v. Dumont (1985) 146 Vt. 252, 499 A.2d 787, State v. Begins (1987) 148 Vt. 186, 531 A.2d 595.

        In those instances where it is impossible for a qualified officer to either make a request that a person suspected of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor give a breath or blood sample or to secure a breath or blood sample of the suspect, the State is free to proceed to prosecute the suspect in the same manner as if the defendant had refused to submit to testing, or as if there were no personnel or facilities reasonably available to obtain a sample of the defendant's breath or blood. State v. Lund, 144 Vt. 171, 475 A.2d 1055 (1984), overruled on other grounds, State v. Dumont (1985) 146 Vt. 252, 499 A.2d 787, State v. Begins (1987) 148 Vt. 186, 531 A.2d 595.

        Where sheriff who arrested defendant for driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor was certified to operate breath testing equipment and had the requisite probable cause to request that defendant submit to a breath test, his failure to make the required request violated this section and required reversal of defendant's conviction despite the fact that there was evidence to support the jury's verdict. State v. Lund, 144 Vt. 171, 475 A.2d 1055 (1984), overruled on other grounds, State v. Dumont (1985) 146 Vt. 252, 499 A.2d 787, State v. Begins (1987) 148 Vt. 186, 531 A.2d 595.

        Mandatory aspect of word "shall" as used in this section concerns the duties of the investigating police officers, and in situation where operator is suspected of driving while intoxicated, officers are required to make request that suspect operator submit to testing, although driver retains his statutory option to refuse and suffer consequences.

        The purpose of requirement of subsec.

        In the case of defendant convicted of driving while there was .10 percent or more by weight of alcohol in his blood, trial court properly refused to give defendant's requested instruction asking the jury to decide whether the arresting officer had reasonable grounds to request a breath test when defendant acted normally and appeared in control of his faculties, since defendant had informed the officer that he had done a lot of drinking and could "pack it away" without visible effects, and, therefore, reasonable grounds for further investigation existed as a matter of law.

        .
       </p>
       <p>
        When the trial court found that defendant repeatedly stated to the police officer his belief that everything, including his conversation with counsel, was being recorded, yet the police officer said nothing to contradict defendant's belief, a reasonable person in defendant's circumstances could conclude that the conversation was being recorded given the officer's silence in response to defendant's multiple statements that he knew he was being recorded. Accordingly, the motion to suppress should have been granted. State v. Gagne, 202 Vt. 255, 148 A.3d 986 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        State did not violate the statute governing consent to taking tests to determine blood alcohol content when the officer took all reasonable steps to provide defendant with his statutory right to counsel: the officer called the two public defenders on duty, allowed defendant to speak privately with the available attorney, again called the two attorneys after defendant said he had been placed on hold, and gave defendant the full thirty-minute period to wait for the attorneys to return his calls. Additionally, defendant was able to reach a public defender and speak with him on the phone, however briefly. State v. Aiken, 200 Vt. 247, 129 A.3d 87 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no indication here that the on-call public defender who put defendant on hold was acting under any directive or enforcing any policy of the Defender General in his interaction with defendant. Thus, there was no violation of the statute governing consent to taking tests to determine blood alcohol content. State v. Aiken, 200 Vt. 247, 129 A.3d 87 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court's cases involving the statute governing consent to taking tests to determine blood alcohol content emphasize the importance of privacy in the detainee's consultation with an attorney; the statutory mandate is fulfilled when reasonable efforts are made to allow an arrestee to consult privately with counsel. Although the consultation here was brief, an attorney-client relationship was formed, and peering behind the veil of that privacy to ascertain the quality of the consultation would open the door to eroding the privacy afforded to detainees in their right to counsel. State v. Aiken, 200 Vt. 247, 129 A.3d 87 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        Relying upon testimony about the content of confidential communication with counsel is unworkable and puts the State in the position of guarantor that the content of the communication is minimally adequate. The best course is to not allow the content of confidential communications to be the basis for determining a violation of the statute governing consent to taking tests to determine blood alcohol content. State v. Aiken, 200 Vt. 247, 129 A.3d 87 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        A DUI suspect's statutory right to consult an attorney prior to deciding whether to submit to an evidentiary test does not entitle the suspect to a consultation with the attorney of the suspect's choosing. State v. May, 178 Vt. 575, 878 A.2d 250 (mem.) (April 14, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Having a statutory right to consult with an attorney is completely ineffective unless police inform defendants of that right before administering an evidentiary breath test; further, the conversation must be meaningful and reasonably private. State v. Powers, 176 Vt. 444, 852 A.2d 605 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's right to private consultation with an attorney before submitting to a breath test is not absolute; however, police may only monitor a suspect's conversation if the likelihood that the suspect will flee or present a threat to himself or others outweighs the right. State v. Powers, 176 Vt. 444, 852 A.2d 605 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        When faced with a challenge under the statute governing defendant's right to private consultation with an attorney before submitting to a breath test, where defendant does not present a security risk, a court must determine if the police justifiably monitored the consultation and whether that monitoring caused defendant to feel inhibited during the conversation under an objective standard. State v. Powers, 176 Vt. 444, 852 A.2d 605 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        State violated defendant's right to a reasonably private consultation with an attorney where an officer respecting defendant's right to a private consultation with an attorney, turned off the audio recording, but because defendant was told that the processing was being recorded, defendant reasonably believed that his conversation with his attorney was also being recorded. State v. Powers, 176 Vt. 444, 852 A.2d 605 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant made no showing that there was any causal connection between the misinformation in the form used to advise him of his right to consult an attorney before submitting to a breath test and his refusal to take the test, his failure to claim or demonstrate some minimal level of prejudice prevented suppression of the breath test. State v. Roya, 174 Vt. 451, 807 A.2d 371 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Requesting an attorney under subsec. (c) of this section was not equivalent to invoking constitutional right to an attorney, and therefore fact that defendant exercised his statutory right to contact an attorney before taking breath test did not affect validity of his subsequent waiver of right to counsel, which he signed prior to being questioned by police. State v. Stenson, 169 Vt. 590, 738 A.2d 567 (mem.) (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Consent form read to DUI suspect, informing him of his right to counsel prior to deciding whether to take breath test, failed to adequately advise him that he had right to speak to a public defender regardless of his income level, and therefore District Court properly entered judgment for suspect in his subsequent civil license suspension hearing. State v. Madonna, 169 Vt. 98, 726 A.2d 498 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Constitutional protections available in criminal proceedings do not attach to statutory right to counsel under implied consent statute, either at the time a breath sample is requested, or at a subsequent license-suspension hearing, and therefore
        Miranda
        warnings do not apply to blood or chemical tests requested or taken under Vermont's implied consent law. State v. Nemkovich, 168 Vt. 8, 712 A.2d 899 (1998).

       </p>
       <p>
        District Court erred in suppressing results of DUI defendant's evidentiary breath test due to invalid waiver of his

        rights; validity of waivers of
        <i>
         Miranda
        </i>
        rights and of implied consent rights should be analyzed independently, and where State trooper read defendant his implied consent rights from processing form, defendant acknowledged his understanding of those rights, and then signed written waiver of right to consult an attorney, this valid waiver of defendant's implied consent rights was not tainted by earlier invalid
        <i>
         Miranda

       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant was told he had a right to talk to a lawyer before questioning and specifically, and in writing, waived that right, defendant executed a written waiver to fully satisfy the requirement of the public defender act, and requiring a written waiver a second time around to respond to the question of whether defendant would take the breath test would be overly formalistic, even ritualistic.

        Although form used by processing officer to record advice given DUI suspect did not indicate defendant was advised of right to consult attorney at public expense before making decision whether to submit to breath test, reversal of suspension of operator's license was not required; defendant had burden of production on issue of prejudice, and was required to introduce some evidence that any deficiency in the advice he received was prejudicial.

        In the absence of any language to the contrary, the blood alcohol test consent statute does not require a trooper to inform the defendant of the possibility that a hospital would waive the charge for an independent test and later seek reimbursement from the Office of the Defender General. State v. Richard, 202 Vt. 519, 150 A.3d 1093 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court rejects the suggestion that Webb stands for the proposition that a police officer may never tell a defendant that he or she must pay for an independent test before its administration. Rather, a possible violation of the blood alcohol test consent statute emerges only if the officer does so inaccurately, and it is the defendant's burden to prove that inaccuracy; indeed, by its plain language, the statute specifically requires a trooper to inform the defendant that an independent test will be at the defendant's own expense. State v. Richard, 202 Vt. 519, 150 A.3d 1093 (2016).

        There was no statutory violation when the Department of Health's mislabeling and destruction of defendant's blood sample prevented him from obtaining an independent test.

        Breath-testing equipment was not reasonably available for purposes of the implied consent statute. It was not reasonable for an officer to remove defendant from the hospital where he was being treated to obtain a breath test, as he could not determine when the treatment would end and the two-hour permissive inference window would soon close; moreover, there was no evidence that the officer could have reached another location and administered a breath test to defendant within the two-hour window.

        Where perceived monitoring of his conversation with an attorney caused defendant to feel inhibited from asking questions, his inability to get answers to these questions contributed in large part to his decision to refuse the evidentiary breath test, and there was therefore a sufficient causal nexus between the police violation of his statutory right with an attorney and his refusal to submit to the evidentiary breath test; the District Court erred when it denied defendant's motion to suppress the evidence of that refusal and, because that evidence was central to the State's case in the civil suspension hearing, the court further erred in suspending defendant's driver's license.

        Mechanism established by the Legislature for providing DUI detainees an opportunity to obtain professional advice from counsel before deciding whether to submit to a test places clear responsibilities on two agencies of State government: the police, who must comply with their statutory obligation to contact the public defender at the appropriate time during DUI processing, and the public defenders, who equally must comply with their statutory obligation to counsel detainees.

        The right to consultation is the right for DUI detainees to obtain accurate information about their legal options; it is not the right to unassailable legal advice. State v. Velez, 174 Vt. 448, 819 A.2d 712 (mem.) (2002).

        Defendant's statutory right to counsel before deciding whether or not to take a breath test is violated where the police unjustifiably monitor a defendant's legal consultation and the monitoring inhibits, coerces, or otherwise restricts the defendant's ability to meaningfully engage with his attorney. State v. Sherwood, 174 Vt. 27, 800 A.2d 463 (2002).

       <p>
        Conclusion that the State violated defendant's right to a private consultation with his lawyer prior to his decision to take or forego a breath test by taping the conversation was warranted because the tape itself was evidence that defendant's conversation with counsel was not, in fact, private, and, as the trial court found, the State did not have a legitimate security concern regarding defendant. State v. Sherwood, 174 Vt. 27, 800 A.2d 463 (2002).

       <p>
        Even though the State violated defendant's right to a private consultation with his lawyer prior to his decision to take or forego a breath test, suppression of his refusal to submit to the test was neither appropriate nor required because some causal nexus must exist between the alleged illegality and the evidence a defendant seeks to keep from the jury, and defendant's refusal to provide an evidentiary sample of his breath could in no way be construed as the product of the surreptitious videotaping of which he was completely unaware at the time he decided to refuse to submit to the test.

        Police officer's refusal to provide criminal record information, and counsel's subsequent refusal to provide legal advice to DUI suspect, did not amount to total denial of suspect's opportunity to consult with counsel; mandate of subsec.

        Fact that arresting officer unintentionally provided erroneous information to public defender concerning number of prior DWI convictions defendant had did not mean defendant was deprived of meaningful opportunity to consult with counsel; right to counsel contained in this section concerns an arrestee's opportunity to consult freely with an attorney, not with attorney's right to consult with, or obtain correct information from, police.

        Defendant was not denied effective assistance of counsel under subsec. (c) of this section, even though police officers remained within sight and range of hearing during defendant's telephone conversation with his attorney, where defendant knew from his experience as a law enforcement officer that he could have asked for more privacy, there was no evidence that the police attempted to eavesdrop or that they used information obtained from the conversation to defendant's detriment, and defendant made no showing as to what else he might have desired to ask his attorney had there been no officers nearby.

        Trial court did not abuse its discretion in denying petition for extraordinary relief of defendant whose operator's license had been suspended; defendant's stance what he would take breath test only after consulting lawyer he knew to be unavailable was tantamount to refusal under this section.

       </p>
       <p>
        Under the totality of the circumstances test, defendant's delay in taking a blood alcohol evidentiary test amounted to a refusal of such test; the officer made a reasonable effort to contact his attorney of choice several times and did manage to contact a public defender to speak with the defendant; the relevant statute does not require that the defendant speak with the attorney of his choice, just that he be afforded an opportunity to speak with an attorney.

       <p>
        Defendant's right to consult with an attorney before deciding whether or not to take a breath test was not compromised by the fact that he consulted with his attorney before he was asked to take the test, rather than after the request was made, where after the conversation with the attorney defendant told a police officer that he had been advised to take the breath test.

        Defendant's right to consult with counsel before submitting to a breath test under subsec.

       <p>
        When unlawful police conduct relates solely to police activity that is unconnected to the decision to take the evidentiary breath test, and has no negative consequences to the criminal charge, suppression of a breath test is inappropriate. State v. May, 178 Vt. 575, 878 A.2d 250 (mem.) (April 14, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant's purpose in requesting cell phone calls to his father or his attorney at roadside was specifically to seek advice on whether to submit to a preliminary, nonevidentiary breath screening, no causal nexus existed between the refusal to permit the phone calls and any statements that were made after the officer's refusal; therefore, suppression of an evidentiary breath test taken later at the station was error. State v. May, 178 Vt. 575, 878 A.2d 250 (mem.) (April 14, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        To suppress evidence of refusal to submit to a breath test, defendant must show a causal nexus between the alleged illegality and the evidence a defendant seeks to suppress. State v. Powers, 176 Vt. 444, 852 A.2d 605 (2004).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant was not denied a fair trial because arresting officer, during cross-examination by defense counsel, twice made reference to giving defendant an alco-sensor test. State v. Beattie, 157 Vt. 162, 596 A.2d 919 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Finding in civil license suspension proceeding that defendant was not given enough time to decide whether to take breath test did not collaterally estop State from introducing evidence at criminal DUI trial that defendant refused to take test, since State did not have full and fair opportunity in civil proceeding to litigate issue of whether defendant refused to take test. State v. Stearns, 159 Vt. 266, 617 A.2d 140 (1992).
       </p>
       <p>
        Results of breath test should have been suppressed, where trial court made a finding that the defendant was informed by officer at police station that refusal to take the test could result in overnight lodging. State v. Kozel, 146 Vt. 534, 505 A.2d 1221 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Motorist was unduly prejudiced by admission of results of improperly obtained breath test, requiring reversal of conviction for driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, where numerical test result was admitted merely as corroboration that motorist had been drinking, the results were not related back to the time of operation, and the State emphasized the importance of the test results in its closing argument. State v. Kozel, 146 Vt. 534, 505 A.2d 1221 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the case of defendant found guilty of operating a motor vehicle on a public highway while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, trial court was without error in denying motion to suppress evidence in connection with breath alcohol test which revealed an excess of .10 percent of alcohol in defendant's blood where the officer had reasonable grounds to request the test. State v. LeBeau, 144 Vt. 315, 476 A.2d 128 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since subsec. (b) of this section explicitly states that a preliminary breath test is a screening device only, to be used to aid an officer in determining whether further and more accurate testing is required, and provides that its results are inadmissible as substantive evidence of intoxication, a defendant charged with driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor may not waive the prohibition against using the results of such tests. State v. Hull, 143 Vt. 353, 465 A.2d 1371 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the case of defendant convicted of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, trial court did not err in granting State's motion in limine to exclude any evidence relating to alco-sensor preliminary breath test which measured defendant's blood alcohol at .12 percent, as a result of which he was taken to police barracks and given a gas chromatograph breath test, which showed a reading of .20 percent blood alcohol. State v. Hull, 143 Vt. 353, 465 A.2d 1371 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the case of defendant convicted of operating a motor vehicle while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, where the court granted defendant's motion to suppress all evidence relating to a breath test, trial court did not err in refusing to allow defendant to introduce evidence of the fact that he voluntarily took the test, since the possibility of jury speculation as to the suppressed results was sufficient to render the admissibility of the fact that the test was taken a matter of trial court's discretion. State v. Johnson, 143 Vt. 355, 465 A.2d 1366 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the defendant, who was charged with driving under the influence and who remained at the police station without being arrested, while being processed by the police preliminary to being asked for a breath test, was refused the right to call her boyfriend until after the thirty minute waiting period, provided in subsec. (c) of this section, such refusal constituted an unauthorized restraint on the defendant sufficient to cloud the proceedings held pursuant to section 1205 of this title, relating to the defendant's refusal to submit to the test, rendering evidence of that refusal inadmissible on trial, and was cause for remand for a new trial without the inadmissible evidence. State v. Carmody, 140 Vt. 631, 442 A.2d 1292 (1982).

        Defender General's specific direction to on-call attorneys not to provide any legal services to a DUI detainee unless the police officer disclosed the operator's prior record breached the Defender General's statutory responsibility to provide twenty-four hour counsel.

        Because the State failed to comply with subsec. (g) of this section, defendant could not obtain legal advice to aid him in weighing his options as the law intended, and the only fair remedy was to suppress the result of defendant's uninformed choice.

       <p>
        Because credibility determinations are solely within the province of the fact finder, the trial court in a civil driver's license suspension proceeding did not err in choosing to discredit a forensic chemist's testimony where it directly contradicted the State's own training manual, which provided that in the event of a fatal error, a machine should be taken out of service. The trial court properly grounded its decision that the second test to actually yield a result was not conducted in a valid or reliable manner in accordance with the Department of Health's methodology. State v. Spooner, 192 Vt. 465, 60 A.3d 640 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Read in light of one another, the driver's license civil suspension statute and the implied consent statute dictate that if a person elects to have a second blood alcohol test, the methods of that test are reviewable for validity and reliability by the court at a final civil-suspension hearing. State v. Spooner, 192 Vt. 465, 60 A.3d 640 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Driver's license civil-suspension statute clearly calls on the trial judge to review both the reliability of any evidentiary tests conducted and compliance with the implied consent statute. The implied consent statute affords a person a right to a second blood alcohol test, which must be conducted in a reliable fashion; if a court finds that the second test was conducted in an unreliable fashion, the State has necessarily failed to carry its burden to establish compliance with the implied consent statute, and the court must then deny the civil suspension of a defendant's license. State v. Spooner, 192 Vt. 465, 60 A.3d 640 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutory compliance is an element the State had the burden to establish to prevail in its civil-suspension complaint. The trial court correctly concluded that the lack of a reliable second test deprived the State of an essential element to establish its civil-suspension case. State v. Spooner, 192 Vt. 465, 60 A.3d 640 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where after the first breath test of defendant, he asked to take a second test, and when the officer attempted to perform the test, the machine malfunctioned, there was no reason to suppress the results of the first test because there was no evidence that the test was invalid or that the police officer acted in bad faith, and defendant was properly informed of his right to take an independent test but chose not to do so. State v. Vezina, 177 Vt. 488, 857 A.2d 313 (mem.) (July 1, 2004).

        That defendant accused of driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor had not been arrested or taken into custody prior to the time he consented to a blood test to determine alcoholic content did not render the results of the test inadmissible.

       <p>
        It was not essential that devices for testing breath, such as the photoelectric intoximeter, be operated by a scientist, or that the operator understood the technical and scientific functioning of the device before the operator could be found competent to testify to the results. State v. Magoon, 128 Vt. 363, 264 A.2d 779 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Proper administration of a breath test must be fully established before results may be admitted in evidence, including full proof that the equipment was in proper order, the operator qualified, and the test correctly given. State v. Magoon, 128 Vt. 363, 264 A.2d 779 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where officer administering breath test with photoelectric intoximeter had sufficient knowledge, experience, and training to properly set up, operate, and read the intoximeter, the fact that he was unable to explain the technical workings of the intoximeter or precisely identify the constituents of the chemical substances used did not render the results of the test inadmissible as a matter of law. State v. Magoon, 128 Vt. 363, 264 A.2d 779 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        The results of accepted chemical testing methods need not be infallible to be admissible, and if a test affords reasonable assistance to the triers of facts, technical shortages in the manner or method of proof may affect the weight of the results but do not control their admissibility. State v. Magoon, 128 Vt. 363, 264 A.2d 779 (1970).
       </p>
       <p>
        Failure to give defendant who voluntarily took intoximeter test warnings as to his right to counsel and to remain silent did not preclude admission of evidence as to result of the test. State v. LaFleche, 127 Vt. 482, 253 A.2d 124 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        Arrest was not a statutory prerequisite to the admissibility of a chemical breath test analysis under the provisions of this section if such test was administered with the respondent's consent. State v. Brown, 125 Vt. 58, 209 A.2d 324 (1965), overruled on other grounds. State v. Dacey (1980) 138 Vt. 491, 418 A.2d 856.

        Trooper's decision to administer a preliminary breath test (PBT) to defendant rather than allow him to continue driving when defendant smelled of alcohol, admitted to drinking, and had bloodshot eyes was premised on a reasonable suspicion of driving under the influence (DUI), imposed a minimal intrusion on defendant's liberty, and was aimed at preventing serious danger to the public; it did not violate either the Vermont or the United States Constitution. The results of the PBT, in turn, provided probable cause to arrest defendant for DUI. State v. Mara, 186 Vt. 389, 987 A.2d 939 (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        It is reasonable, under both the Fourth Amendment and the Vermont Constitution, for an officer to administer a preliminary breath test to a suspect if the officer can point to specific, articulable facts indicating that an individual has been driving under the influence of alcohol.

        When defendant did not challenge the trial court's findings that a trooper had reasonable grounds to request that he submit to a preliminary breath test and that the results of that preliminary test provided a further basis to request performance of other field sobriety exercises, the officer's administration of these tests thus met the constitutional requirements imposed by the Vermont Constitution and the Fourth Amendment.

        Under the plain language of the testing statute, when an officer has a reasonable suspicion of driving under the influence, the officer may "request" that the suspect provide a breath sample, but not order such participation; this conclusion is in keeping with the prior interpretation of this statutory language, which delineates that drivers may not be forced to comply with a request to take a preliminary breath test (PBT) and have a right to refuse to take the PBT. Thus, even though there is no statutory or constitutional obligation on law enforcement to inform suspects of their right to refuse, law enforcement officers must "request" - rather than order - a detained motorist to provide a breath sample for a PBT.

       <p>
        Because a trooper failed to request that defendant take a preliminary breath test (PBT), but simply held it up to him, his actions contravened the testing statute's directive. Therefore, the PBT was improperly obtained and the result should not have been considered in the court's determination of whether there was sufficient probable cause to arrest defendant for driving under the influence. State v. Therrien, 191 Vt. 24, 38 A.3d 1129 (2011).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plain meaning of the words that an officer must have "reason to believe" that a person "may be" driving under the influence indicates that an officer need not have incontrovertible proof of the underlying offense and need not even have probable cause of the DUI; at the point a preliminary breath test is administered, the officer needs only to have some basis for believing that a suspect may be driving under the influence. This basis can also be expressed as reasonable, articulable facts supporting the belief that criminal behavior is afoot. State v. Santimore, 186 Vt. 638, 987 A.2d 332 (mem.) (2009).
       </p>
       <p>
        At the point a preliminary breath test (PBT) was administered, an officer needed only to have some basis for believing that a suspect might be driving under the influence; thus, when an officer smelled alcohol and saw that defendant's eyes were bloodshot and watery, this was enough to provide him with reasonable suspicion that defendant had been driving under the influence (DUI) and justified administration of the PBT and the subsequent dexterity tests. The results of those tests (including a 0.106 blood alcohol content and failure of six measures of dexterity) combined with the other observed indicia of intoxication provided the officer with probable cause to arrest defendant for DUI. State v. Santimore, 186 Vt. 638, 987 A.2d 332 (mem.) (2009).

        Where State's chemist provided a reasonable explanation that leakage was responsible for the 0.000 percent result following blood-alcohol test on one of defendant's breath samples and chemist also testified that both samples were analyzed in compliance with the Department of Health's rules, there was no reason to believe that the 0.168 percent result (following test of second sample) was unreliable.

        Even if the court accepted defendant's argument that the word "results" in the statute governing admission of breath tests encompassed not just numerical data, but a defendant's choice to refuse a preliminary breath test (PBT), it was proper to admit defendant's refusal to take a PBT in the refusal stage of her trial for refusal to take a breath test, as the statute allowed use of a PBT "result" to demonstrate whether the officer had a reasonable basis to ask for a test, which was the purpose for which it was introduced here.

       </p>
       <p>
        Breath test results were admissible in a criminal case when both times a result was sought, the machine returned an error message, then produced a result after being restarted. Because the fact that the officer was able to obtain results indicated that the machine was operating properly at the time of the tests, a chemist's affidavit was sufficient to meet the standard for admissibility; furthermore, while expert testimony was relevant to show that the test results were unreliable, it did not undermine the admissibility of those results, and the discrepancy between the two test results of .229 and .260 was insufficient to undermine the foundation facts necessary for admissibility.

        Error in admitting the results of a preliminary breath test (PBT) was harmless. Just as an officer's observations - the odor of alcohol, defendant's watery eyes, an empty alcohol container, and defendant's admission of drinking - provided reasonable suspicion to request a PBT, they also provided reasonable suspicion to conduct field sobriety tests, and defendant's poor performance of the dexterity tests combined with the officer's other observations provided probable cause to arrest defendant for driving under the influence.

When seeking to use the test results at trial as evidence of a driver's BAC, the State may lay the foundation for the results of infrared breath tests by showing that the analysis met the performance standards contained in the regulations; a defendant faced with criminal charges or civil suspension may contest these foundation facts, but may not otherwise challenge the test's admissibility. State v. Rolfe, 166 Vt. 1, 686 A.2d 949 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the case of defendant convicted of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor, the State did not fail to lay a proper foundation for admission of blood alcohol test when it failed to call as an expert witness the doctor who drew the blood sample used for the test but instead called a police officer who had observed the doctor as he acquired the sample, since the officer, in testifying as to his observations of the doctor taking the sample, was relating a procedure that required only common knowledge and experience to judge; expert testimony was not needed. State v. Harris, 144 Vt. 81, 472 A.2d 755 (1984).
       </p>
       <p>
        Contention that container for breath sample, set aside for driver when breath sample were taken for purpose of measuring amount of alcohol in blood, was found to be improperly sealed upon receipt of it by attorney for driver charged with driving under the influence of alcohol, did not make results of test by police inadmissible where this section's provision requiring that sample be taken and set aside for driver did not require its container to be sealed. State v. Ladieu, 130 Vt. 496, 296 A.2d 215 (1972).

        Without a challenge to the trial court's findings that defendant was not ordered to submit to a preliminary breath test or field sobriety tests - or further factual development at the hearing, such as testimony from defendant indicating that he was coerced to participate against his will - the court rejected defendant's argument that circumstances amounting to no more than a classically mundane police encounter rendered his participation involuntary.

        Vermont's statutory scheme does not provide a DUI suspect with the right to an independent blood test at the State's expense; it is only when the facility where the sample is drawn is unable to obtain payment from the person seeking a test that the Defender General becomes responsible for the costs and, even then, the Defender General may attempt to recoup those costs from the suspect. State v. Benoir, 174 Vt. 632, 819 A.2d 699 (mem.) (2002).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Because defendant did not counter the trooper's statements that he would have to pay $75 before a hospital would administer an independent test, the trooper had not improperly denied him his right to get the test. State v. Richard, 202 Vt. 519, 150 A.3d 1093 (2016).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no statutory violation when the Department of Health's mislabeling and destruction of defendant's blood sample prevented him from obtaining an independent test. There was no evidence that the State trooper acted in bad faith or did anything to prevent defendant from obtaining an independent blood sample; it was the Department that failed to correctly label the sample, resulting in it being misfiled and eventually destroyed. State v. Gentes, 193 Vt. 669, 70 A.3d 967 (mem.) (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant's request for an independent blood sample was refused by a hospital because he did not have the money to pay for it, there was no state interference with defendant's statutory right, and therefore suppression of an evidentiary breath test was unwarranted. State v. Benoir, 174 Vt. 632, 819 A.2d 699 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a DUI criminal and civil suspension case, there was no basis to infer that defendant was prevented or improperly discouraged from exercising his right to an independent blood test. Defendant cited no authority for the proposition that an officer was barred from accurately reminding defendant that the test was at his own expense or from attempting to respond to defendant's questions; he did not demonstrate that the officer's responses were, in fact, inaccurate; and he acknowledged that he was never told that he would be required to pay for the test that night. State v. Webb, 188 Vt. 137, 998 A.2d 709 (2010).

        Where various sections of this subchapter showed that Legislature had decreed that chemical tests, including breath tests, be taken to determine presence of alcohol in the driver's blood, and various sections referred to weight of alcohol in the blood, expressed as a percentage, as the determining factor, provision of this section that "weight of alcohol in the person's blood or breath" could create presumption of influence was not unconstitutionally vague due to the reference to weight of alcohol in the breath, but the words "or breath" were unnecessary and would be held severed from the section, for the section did not create a presumption based on weight of alcohol in the breath. State v. Stevens, 137 Vt. 473, 408 A.2d 622 (1979).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Legislature has recognized the necessity that an evidentiary test be timely by allowing a permissive inference that a test result of .10 or greater "within two hours" of operation shows operation under the influence of alcohol. Therefore, it is reasonable for an officer to request a test that can be completed within the two-hour window. State v. Dubuque, 193 Vt. 180, 67 A.3d 238 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        A blood-alcohol-content (B.A.C.) of .149 percent cannot be rounded off to fall within terms of this section, under which a B.A.C. level of .15 percent or more within the hours of an alleged offense permits an inference that a person was in violation of section prohibiting operation of vehicle under the influence of intoxicating liquor. State v. Parah, 155 Vt. 655, 587 A.2d 403 (mem.) (1991). (Decided under prior law.)
       </p>
       <p>
        In order for mandatory presumption under subdiv. (a)(1) of this section to be properly raised, there must be expert testimony relating the blood alcohol content test results back to the time of operation. State v. Lombard, 146 Vt. 411, 505 A.2d 1182 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant's blood alcohol content test results were never introduced into evidence, defendant could not avail himself of the mandatory presumption under subdiv. (a)(1) of this section. State v. Lombard, 146 Vt. 411, 505 A.2d 1182 (1985).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where at defendant's trial for operating a motor vehicle on a public highway while under the influence of intoxicating liquor trial court charged the jury that if it found that at the time defendant operated the vehicle she had a blood alcohol content of 0.05 percent or less, it was "permitted to infer" that she was not under the influence of intoxicating liquor, since subdiv. (a)(1) of this section created a mandatory presumption that if the jury found defendant's blood alcohol content to be 0.05 percent or less, they could not find her to be under the influence, it was reversible error for the court to charge the jury otherwise. State v. Young, 143 Vt. 413, 465 A.2d 1375 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution for driving under the influence of intoxicating liquor, subdiv. (a)(3) of this section permits but does not compel a jury finding that defendant was under the influence of intoxicating liquor while operating a motor vehicle upon proof of .10 percent or more blood-alcohol content by weight at the time of operation, but in order to take advantage of this inference, the State must produce expert testimony relating the blood-alcohol test results back to the time of operation. State v. Carter, 142 Vt. 588, 458 A.2d 1112 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Inference created by this section is that defendant was under the influence at the time of operation and can only be based on evidence of blood-alcohol content at the time of operation; therefore, for the inference to be raised properly there must be expert testimony relating the test results back to the time of operation, and this section should not be charged to the jury in absence of such relation back. State v. Dacey, 138 Vt. 491, 418 A.2d 856 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section's provision that "the amount of alcohol in the person's blood . . . at the time alleged as shown by chemical analysis of the person's blood or breath shall give rise to the following presumptions" creates a permissive inference, not a mandatory presumption, shifts no burden to defendant, and permits, but does not compel, a jury finding that defendant was under the influence, if it is shown he had .10 percent or more blood-alcohol content; and prior contrary cases are overruled. State v. Dacey, 138 Vt. 491, 418 A.2d 856 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        In prosecution for driving under the influence, instruction that this section gives State a presumption that .10 percent alcohol content means defendant was under the influence, which frequently referred to "presumption" which included statute's mandatory language, and which had the effect of placing at least the burden of producing evidence on defendant when the statute did not compel defendant to do so, was reversible error. State v. Dacey, 138 Vt. 491, 418 A.2d 856 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the court's instructions relating to subdiv. (a)(3) of this section, which allows the jury to find that the defendant was under the influence at the time of operation upon proof of .10 percent blood alcohol content at that time, gave the section the effect of a burden-shifting presumption, rather than the effect of a permissive inference, there was reversible error. State v. White, 139 Vt. 23, 421 A.2d 1283 (1980).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where the breath sample taken from the defendant showed a .18 percent blood alcohol concentration, and the court instructed the jury that it might presume the defendant to be under the influence of intoxicating liquor if it found at the time alleged in the information that there was .10 percent or more by weight of alcohol in the defendant's blood, the instruction was consistent with the statutory scheme and with the underlying scientific data. State v. Stevens, 137 Vt. 473, 408 A.2d 622 (1979).

       <p>
        Trial court did not commit plain error in giving "permissive inference" instruction at DUI trial, since jury did not need to rely on that instruction to reach its verdict as there was ample credible evidence to support conclusion that defendant was under influence of intoxicating liquor at time of operation. State v. Carpenter, 170 Vt. 371, 749 A.2d 1137 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court at DUI trial properly refused instruction that if defendant's blood-alcohol content was found to be 0.05 percent or less, jury could presume that defendant was not under the influence of intoxicating liquor; for presumption to arise under then-effective version of "permissive inference" statute, results of breath or blood test must have been introduced into evidence and related back to the time of operation. State v. Zumbo, 157 Vt. 589, 601 A.2d 986 (1991).

       <p>
        Since the right of an operator of a motor vehicle to refuse to submit to a test of alcohol content of breath or blood is a creature of statute and granted by legislative grace and is not a constitutional right, the Legislature may properly condition the exercise of the right by providing that any refusal may be introduced as evidence in a criminal proceeding, and admission of refusal evidence does not violate privilege against self-incrimination. State v. Brean, 136 Vt. 147, 385 A.2d 1085 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Introduction of evidence of driver's refusal to take a breath test did not violate his constitutional privilege against self-incrimination under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Welch v. District Court, 461 F. Supp. 592 (D. Vt. 1978), aff'd, 594 F.2d 903 (2d Cir. 1979).
       </p>
       <p>
        Admission of refusal to consent to breath test for blood alcohol content upon arrest for suspected driving under the influence was not in violation of privilege against self-incrimination. State v. Welch, 136 Vt. 442, 394 A.2d 1115 (1978).

        Consent form read to DUI suspect, informing him of his right to counsel prior to deciding whether to take breath test, failed to adequately advise him that he had right to speak to a public defender regardless of his income level, and therefore District Court properly entered judgment for suspect in his subsequent civil license suspension hearing. State v. Madonna, 169 Vt. 98, 726 A.2d 498 (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        DUI defendant was not deprived of his constitutional right to counsel when his telephone conversation with counsel was observed at close proximity by a police officer, even though officer later testified about defendant's demeanor during the call at defendant's trial; no use was made at trial of the conversation's content, and no evidence was presented that defendant was inhibited in his conference with counsel. Brow v. District Court of Vermont, 153 Vt. 488, 572 A.2d 1347 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Driver's license of defendant suspected of driving while intoxicated should not have been suspended, where his refusal to submit to blood alcohol test was premised on State's inability to provide him with a consultation with a lawyer before he was required to make up his mind whether to take the test. State v. Garvey, 157 Vt. 105, 595 A.2d 267 (1991).

       <p>
        In view of provisions of this section protecting an operator's right to refuse to take any test when a serious criminal case is involved, the request to submit to a chemical test can rise to level of a "critical stage" in the proceedings, and therefore, police officers may not, without reason, deny access between an accused and his lawyer, when such access is requested and is readily available and will not interfere with investigation of the matter at hand.

       </p>
       <p>
        Plain language of this section indicated Legislature intended the summary suspension to be of a civil nature, where title was "civil suspension; summary procedure" and statute embodied distinctly civil procedures. State v. Strong, 158 Vt. 56, 605 A.2d 510 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        For purposes of double jeopardy protections, civil license suspension was not a "punishment," where governing statute's plain language indicated suspension was of civil nature, statutory scheme was not so punitive as to negate Legislature's intent to make it civil in nature, suspension was actually the revocation of a privilege voluntarily granted, license suspensions had historically served a regulatory purpose, element of deterrence present in suspension was common in all losses of licenses or privileges and was not primary focus of statutory scheme, and suspension served rational remedial purpose of protecting public safety.

        The summary refusal hearing held pursuant to subsec. (a) of this section is in the nature of an administrative proceeding and is the determination of a civil matter, involving only the question of suspension. Pfeil v. Rutland District Court, 147 Vt. 305, 515 A.2d 1052 (1986).

       <p>

       <p>
        Where the jury at defendant's criminal trial for driving under the influence returned a general verdict of not guilty, but did not specify the grounds upon which the verdict stood (whether defendant's blood alcohol content (BAC) was under the legal limit, or, regardless of defendant's BAC, there was an affirmative defense of necessity), because defendant did not, therefore, establish that determination of his BAC was necessary and essential to the criminal verdict, collateral estoppel did not apply and the trial court was correct to allow relitigation of the BAC issue at his driver's license civil suspension proceeding. State v. Pollander, 167 Vt. 301, 706 A.2d 1359 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant failed to satisfy the element of collateral estoppel which requires that applying preclusion in a later action is fair.
    While he argued that the State's failure at his criminal trial to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that his blood alcohol content (BAC) was .08 percent or more precluded the State, at his driver's license suspension hearing, from proving that his BAC was above the legal limit, he ignored that what cannot be proven beyond a reasonable doubt may still be proven by a preponderance of the evidence.

       </h5>
       <p>
        The plain language of subsec. (g) of this section indicates the Legislature's intent to limit the issues that may be presented at a driver's license civil suspension hearing to those enumerated.
    Excluding the necessity defense and other affirmative defenses serves the goals of the statute by minimizing procedural delay. State v. Pollander, 167 Vt. 301, 706 A.2d 1359 (1997).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether State Police officer had the right to make an independent judgment, upon observing driver, that driver was unable to give a sufficient sample of his breath for test to determine blood alcohol content is a substantial issue of law affecting merits of hearing to determine reasonableness of driver's refusal to take the test. Miner v. District Court, 136 Vt. 426, 392 A.2d 390 (1978).
       </p>

        Upon refusal to submit to a test, the only relevant question for the court to decide at the summary hearing is whether the facts and circumstances provide a reasonable basis for officer's judgment that driver was operating, attempting to operate or in actual physical control of a vehicle while under the influence.

        In a "reasonableness" hearing under this section, the duty of the court is to evaluate the facts and circumstances presented as persuading the officer that he should request the respondent to take a test, and such evaluation is not a test of compliance with evidentiary rules restricting hearsay, but an examination into the reasonableness of officer's belief.

        The Department of Health regulations relating to infrared breath tests used to determine blood-alcohol content (BAC) of defendants charged with driving under the influence of alcohol meet the statutory requirements of 23 V.S.A.
        §§
        1203(d) and 1205(g) and are valid. When seeking to use the test results at trial as evidence of a driver's BAC, the State may lay the foundation for the results of infrared breath tests by showing that the analysis met the performance standards contained in the regulations; a defendant faced with criminal charges or civil suspension may contest these foundation facts, but may not otherwise challenge the test's admissibility.

        When defendant at his trial for driving under the influence of alcohol had failed to make any claim regarding the specific use, either direct or derived, of immunized testimony derived from his civil suspension hearing, there was no reason to reverse his conviction. The trial court took appropriate steps to ensure that defendant enjoyed the full extent of this immunity, and defendant had not alleged any actual use of immunized testimony, which was all that the civil suspension immunity statute prohibited. State v. Neumann, 183 Vt. 1, 944 A.2d 228 (Nov. 21, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        When at a criminal trial for driving under the influence, a defendant objects to the admission of testimony a defendant has given at his or her civil suspension merits hearing, the defendant must meet the initial burden of producing evidence that the testimony was in fact provided by the defendant at the civil suspension hearing. Once this is established, if the evidence is to be admitted, the prosecution must prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the testimony was not provided by the defendant at his or her civil suspension hearing.

        When a driving-under-the-influence defendant objects to the admission of evidence which the defendant contends is the fruit of his or her civil suspension testimony, the defendant must meet the burden of producing evidence of a relationship between the defendant's civil suspension hearing testimony and the alleged derivative evidence to which the defendant has objected. Once this prima facie showing has been made, the objection must be sustained unless the prosecution proves by a preponderance of the evidence the lack of any impermissible relationship between the testimony at the suspension hearing and the evidence offered in the criminal proceeding, and that the evidence offered in the criminal proceeding has a source independent of the suspension hearing testimony; to facilitate this procedure, the defendant should timely file a motion in limine to identify for the court any such issue about which the defendant is aware sufficiently in advance of trial so as to avoid unnecessary delay in the criminal proceeding.

Defendant's citing of the provision concerning whether the law enforcement officer had reasonable grounds to believe the person was operating, attempting to operate, or in actual physical control of a vehicle in his list of issues to be raised at the civil suspension hearing necessarily gave notice to the prosecutor that defendant was preserving his right to question the validity of the underlying stop; after the Court's decision in Lussier, the provision included as a matter of law the issue of the validity of the underlying stop.

       <p>
        To rebut the presumption in subsec. (n) of this section, defendant must only produce evidence sufficient to support a finding that his BAC was under 0.08 percent at the time of operation. A party is not required to overcome the presumption with evidence, but must only produce evidence fairly and reasonably tending to show that the real fact is not as presumed, and once he has done so, the fact in question is to be established by evidence as are other questions of fact, without aid from the presumption. State v. Giard, 178 Vt. 544, 871 A.2d 976 (mem.) (March 23, 2005).

        The State could not rely on the presumption in subsec.

State v. Lowe, 169 Vt. 575, 740 A.2d 348 (mem.) (1999).
       </p>
       <p>
        Nothing in the wording of subdiv. (g)(4) of this section, which governs the issues that may be heard at civil suspension proceedings, suggests that a presumption of admissibility exists in regard to test results; instead, the language of the section sets up an aid in proving that testing methods were valid and reliable and that the test results were accurate and accurately evaluated by establishing a presumption that these issues are resolved by a showing that the test was taken and evaluated in compliance with Department of Health rules, which affects the burden of production of evidence but not its admissibility.

       <p>
        Trial court erred in refusing to suspend defendant's automobile operator's license following civil license suspension hearing where defendant introduced evidence raising a theoretical possibility that the presumption that a person is intoxicated at the time of operation if his blood alcohol content is .10 percent or more within two hours of operation may not be true in all cases, because defendant's evidence, which was of a general, theoretical nature, was insufficient to rebut the statutory presumption.

       </p>
       <p>
        It is true that evidence that the test was taken and evaluated in compliance with rules adopted by the Department of Health shall be prima facie evidence that the testing methods used were valid and reliable and that the test results are accurate and were accurately evaluated.

        At the hearing on civil suspension of a driver's license, the State can rely on the officer's affidavit to prove the officer had reasonable grounds to believe that the person was driving while under the influence, that the officer explained the person's rights, and that a test taken by a properly trained officer indicated a BAC level of 0.08 or more. The State can then rely on the affidavit of a chemist who works for the Department of Health, certifying that the test complied with Health Department regulations on breath-testing methods and was an accurate and valid indication of the alcohol concentration in the defendant's system at the time of the test. Thus, if a test result produces a reading of 0.08 or more, and there is no question of relating the test result back to the time of operation, the summary suspension hearing is indeed summary. State v. Anderson, 179 Vt. 43, 890 A.2d 68 (July 22, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        The necessary prerequisite of a civil suspension notice is an affidavit from the processing officer stating that he requested a breath test and "the test indicated that the person's alcohol concentration was 0.08 or more." The officer's affidavit necessarily can attest only to the result generated by the test taken during the processing of the operator. State v. Anderson, 179 Vt. 43, 890 A.2d 68 (July 22, 2005).
       </p>
       <p>
        For a civil suspension of a driver's license to proceed there must be either a refusal or a test result indicating a BAC of 0.08 or more at the time of operation. That BAC can be shown by the rebuttable presumption or through relation back evidence. But first there must be a test result of at least 0.08. State v. Anderson, 179 Vt. 43, 890 A.2d 68 (July 22, 2005).

        No violation of separation of powers existed in State Supreme Court-created administrative motor vehicle license suspension procedure, where civil suspension rule was authorized by both State Constitution and subsec. (p) of this section, and Constitution itself established judicial power for rule promulgation. State v. O'Brien, 158 Vt. 275, 609 A.2d 981 (1992).

        Requirement in this section that notice of intent to suspend a person's operating license be mailed immediately is directory, not mandatory; compliance is not essential to a proceeding's validity. State v. Camolli, 156 Vt. 208, 591 A.2d 53 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where this section requires immediate notice of intent to suspend a person's operating license, the time period begins to run when the law enforcement officer receives the results of the person's alcohol concentration test. State v. Camolli, 156 Vt. 208, 591 A.2d 53 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        District Court finding that the time for giving "immediate notice of intent to suspend" under this section begins when the sample is analyzed was reversed. State v. Camolli, 156 Vt. 208, 591 A.2d 53 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Provision of this section requiring "immediate" notice of intent to suspend a person's operating license was complied with where police officer mailed notice one day after receiving the results of defendant's blood-alcohol content test. State v. Camolli, 156 Vt. 208, 591 A.2d 53 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Court at operator's license suspension hearing properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss for failure of State to meet statutory time limits concerning notice of suspension, officer's affidavit, and holding of hearing; time limits were directory and not essential to validity of proceeding because this section did not specify any consequence for failure to comply, and defendant was not prejudiced by failure to meet the time limits. State v. Skilling, 157 Vt. 647, 595 A.2d 1346 (mem.) (1991).

       <p>
        Once a court finds that there was a reasonable basis for a request that a person suspected of driving while under the influence of intoxicating liquor submit to a breath test, the ensuing license revocation is accomplished purely by administrative action, since neither the court nor the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles has been granted discretionary power under this section. Carpenter v. Vermont Dep't of Motor Vehicles, 143 Vt. 329, 465 A.2d 1379 (1983).

         24. Review.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Under the civil-suspension statute, a trial court is expressly authorized to consider the reliability of testing procedures and the accuracy of results, and whether a test is reliable or accurate is a factual finding. Therefore, the trial court's determination of reliability is not a question of law, but rather a question of fact which the appellate court reviews for clear error, recognizing that the trier of fact is in the best position to determine the weight and sufficiency of the evidence presented. State v. Nugent, 195 Vt. 411, 88 A.3d 429 (2014).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section authorizes an appeal from any adverse decision made by the District Court under this section; right to appeal is not limited only to defendant. State v. Camolli, 156 Vt. 208, 591 A.2d 53 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant's argument that State could not appeal District Court decision which was based on jurisdictional and procedural grounds where this section provided "that a decision of the district court under this section may be appealed as a matter of right to the supreme court" was rejected; "section" referred to the entire section, not just one of its subsections, and fact that court's decision was based on jurisdictional and procedural grounds did not take the proceeding out from under this section. State v. Camolli, 156 Vt. 208, 591 A.2d 53 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        Denial of relief from court order suspending driver's license was affirmed, where defendant failed to demonstrate interference with right to fair trial or to counsel and provisions of this section mandating automatic suspension for refusal to submit to evidentiary test were held constitutional. Brow v. District Court of Vermont, 153 Vt. 488, 572 A.2d 1347 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        Review of summary refusal hearing is by way of a proceeding for extraordinary relief in the nature of a writ of certiorari ordinarily brought in Superior Court. State v. Lynaugh, 148 Vt. 124, 530 A.2d 555 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Hearing on petition for extraordinary relief to review summary refusal hearing is not de novo and, unlike an appeal, reaches only questions of law and is discretionary according to the merits of the case made by the petition and the record. State v. Lynaugh, 148 Vt. 124, 530 A.2d 555 (1987).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since there is no statutory right to appeal from an adverse ruling in a refusal hearing held pursuant to subsec. (a) of this section, the review available is by way of a petition for extraordinary relief under V.R.A.P. 21. Pfeil v. Rutland District Court, 147 Vt. 305, 515 A.2d 1052 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Superior Court does not have jurisdiction under V.R.C.P. 75 to review order of District Court requiring suspension of driver's license for refusal to submit to alcohol testing. Pfeil v. Rutland District Court, 147 Vt. 305, 515 A.2d 1052 (1986).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where person charged with driving while intoxicated did not present to trial court the claim that failure of police to advise him of alleged right to counsel to assist in decision whether to take breath test denied right to counsel at critical stage of the proceedings and made refusal inadmissible at trial, the claim could not be considered on appeal, and Supreme Court could find no glaring error so grave that it struck at heart of constitutional rights and allowed consideration of the claim under the "'plain error" rule. State v. Welch, 136 Vt. 442, 394 A.2d 1115 (1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Record in summary hearing to determine question whether driver's license should be suspended was separate and distinct from, and not a part of, subsequent criminal prosecution for driving under the influence of alcohol, and could not be considered on appeal from conviction in the criminal case, so that claim of error presented on appeal and founded on testimony in summary hearing was without foundation in the evidence in the criminal case and could not be considered. State v. McGrath, 130 Vt. 400, 296 A.2d 636 (1972).
       </p>
       <p>
        A petition for a writ of certiorari is an appropriate remedy to review questions of law arising in the course of a summary hearing held under the implied consent law. State v. Lyon, 129 Vt. 141, 274 A.2d 478 (1971).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Legislature, when it enacted subsec. (t) of the driver's license civil suspension statute, intended to make the time limits in subsecs. (g) and (h) directive for first offenses, but mandatory and jurisdictional for second or subsequent offenses. Thus, for second or subsequent offenses, the court must comply with the 21-day rule in subsec. (g) and the 21-day and 42-day rules in subsec. (h), absent consent by the defendant or good cause shown, or the civil suspension hearing must be dismissed for lack of jurisdiction. State v. Love, 205 Vt. 418, 174 A.3d 761 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because for second or subsequent offenses, both the 21-day rule in subsec. (g) of the driver's license civil suspension statute and the 21-day rule in subsec. (h) were mandatory and jurisdictional, and defendant's final hearing was scheduled more than 21 days after her preliminary hearing, her civil suspension had to be dismissed. State v. Love, 205 Vt. 418, 174 A.3d 761 (2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court properly denied defendant's motion to dismiss a civil suspension proceeding. There was no dispute that in his request for a continuance, defendant had waived the deadline for a final hearing, and nothing in the legislative language reflected a design for the deadline to recur at any point following a continuance with a defendant's consent. State v. Hawkins, 193 Vt. 297, 67 A.3d 230 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Civil driver's license suspension proceeding should have been dismissed, since final hearing was not held within forty-two days of alleged offense as required by statute, and there was no evidence to support District Court's assumption that State did all it could to bring proceeding in a timely manner. State v. Tongue, 170 Vt. 409, 753 A.2d 356 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutory time limit governing final hearings in civil license suspension proceedings is mandatory, rather than directory; accordingly, if final hearing is not held within forty-two days of date of alleged offense, proceeding must be dismissed unless State demonstrates either that it had defendant's consent or good cause for delay. State v. Singer, 170 Vt. 346, 749 A.2d 614 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        State failed to show good cause for delay in civil license suspension proceeding and thus trial court's dismissal of proceeding was proper, and fact that State was relying on blood test, rather than breath test, did not in and of itself constitute good cause for delay. State v. Singer, 170 Vt. 346, 749 A.2d 614 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        The trial court did not have to dismiss a driver's license civil suspension even though conducting the proceeding a year after the original criminal driving-under-the-influence processing allegedly undermined the statutory objective of a speedy license-suspension process.
    Not only did defendant not show how such a delay prejudiced him, but he requested the continuances that effectuated the delay. State v. Pollander, 167 Vt. 301, 706 A.2d 1359 (1997).

       <p>
        Because credibility determinations are solely within the province of the fact finder, the trial court in a civil driver's license suspension proceeding did not err in choosing to discredit a forensic chemist's testimony where it directly contradicted the State's own training manual, which provided that in the event of a fatal error, a machine should be taken out of service. The trial court properly grounded its decision that the second test to actually yield a result was not conducted in a valid or reliable manner in accordance with the Department of Health's methodology. State v. Spooner, 192 Vt. 465, 60 A.3d 640 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Read in light of one another, the driver's license civil suspension statute and the implied consent statute dictate that if a person elects to have a second blood alcohol test, the methods of that test are reviewable for validity and reliability by the court at a final civil-suspension hearing. State v. Spooner, 192 Vt. 465, 60 A.3d 640 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Driver's license civil-suspension statute clearly calls on the trial judge to review both the reliability of any evidentiary tests conducted and compliance with the implied consent statute. The implied consent statute affords a person a right to a second blood alcohol test, which must be conducted in a reliable fashion; if a court finds that the second test was conducted in an unreliable fashion, the State has necessarily failed to carry its burden to establish compliance with the implied consent statute, and the court must then deny the civil suspension of a defendant's license. State v. Spooner, 192 Vt. 465, 60 A.3d 640 (2012).
       </p>
       <p>
        Statutory compliance is an element the State had the burden to establish to prevail in its civil-suspension complaint. The trial court correctly concluded that the lack of a reliable second test deprived the State of an essential element to establish its civil-suspension case. State v. Spooner, 192 Vt. 465, 60 A.3d 640 (2012).

       <p>
        In a DUI civil-suspension case, there was no merit to defendant's argument that a chemist could not rely on a breath-alcohol testing device's printout ("ticket") because it was not admitted into evidence. Under the liberal evidentiary rules that applied in DUI civil-suspension proceedings, an expert could rely on information not admitted into evidence in forming an opinion. State v. Taylor, 200 Vt. 96, 129 A.3d 660 (2015).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a civil driver's license suspension case, the trial court properly found the expert's calculation to be unreliable because her assumed alcohol elimination rate of 0.015 percent per hour was speculative. The expert offered no credible reason why her assumed elimination rate was reliable as applied to defendant, nor did she testify as to the likelihood that defendant's blood alcohol content was below 0.08 while driving.

        Since deciding whether to refuse to take a test is a decision upon a purely administrative matter, i.e. the possible resultant suspension of license for six months following a civil summary hearing on reasonableness of refusal, failure of an arresting officer to advise person arrested of his right to counsel before requiring him to decide whether he will take intoxication test does not violate his constitutional rights or prevent a finding that refusal to submit to test was unreasonable.

        Driver's belief that officer had no cause to request him to submit to test did not excuse him from submitting to test. McGarry v. Costello, 128 Vt. 234, 260 A.2d 402 (1969).

        A claim of innocence of offense charged, even if vindicated by acquittal, afforded no legal justification for refusing a test; the questions at the summary proceeding to determine reasonableness and the issues at the criminal trial were distinctly different.

        By providing for mandatory one-year license suspension for DUI with fatality resulting, and vesting Commissioner of Motor Vehicles with exclusive authority to calculate suspensions and revocations, Legislature did not expressly or impliedly preempt trial court's probationary power to limit a defendant's operating privileges for longer periods; had Legislature actually intended to eliminate trial court's discretion to prohibit a defendant from driving as a condition of probation for grave vehicular offenses, it would have plainly said so.

        Given that the breathalyzer test results were well above the legal limit of 0.08, combined with expert testimony from the State that defendant's blood alcohol content (BAC) was higher at the time of operation, and absent any evidentiary basis to believe that defendant's BAC could have been lower at the time of operation, the trial court was correct to rule against defendant in a civil suspension hearing.

        Where plaintiff was convicted for out-of-state instance of DUI subsequent to enactment of Driver License Compact and to amendment of statute to allow out-of-state convictions to be used to calculate subsequent convictions for purposes of license suspension and revocation, fact that newly enacted and amended statutes were applied to add out-of-state conviction to previous Vermont conviction did not constitute impermissible ex post facto application of statutes; statutory amendments would have had no impact on plaintiff absent a new act by him (the out-of-state conviction) which triggered the new rule.

        Failure to allege a prior conviction in an information charging violation of section 1183 of this title (now
        §
        1201), operating under the influence, did not prevent the Commissioner of Motor Vehicles from revoking the offender's driver's license upon conviction for the second offense and from refusing to reissue such license until the expiration of six years, as provided by this section, since the suspension was not penal in nature but was designed to promote public safety and therefore the "recidivist" statute, section 674 of this title, did not apply, and also because the revocation was not by the convicting court, but by the Commissioner pursuant to valid regulations. 1966-68 Op.

       <p>
        Charging defendant as habitual criminal was not "double enhancement" of his prior convictions for DUI, and since defendant properly faced charge punishable by life imprisonment, he could lawfully be held without bail. State v. Gardner, 167 Vt. 600, 709 A.2d 499 (mem.) (1998).
       </p>
       <p>
        Absence of language in subsec. (f) of this section expressly allowing concurrent prosecution under general provisions of criminal law did not indicate legislative intent to change common law rule allowing such prosecution. State v. Perry, 151 Vt. 637, 563 A.2d 1007 (1989).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Element of causation in cases of driving under the influence with death resulting in common law standard of direct causation; an intervening cause of death that is not result of defendant's acts would require verdict of not guilty. State v. Yudichak, 151 Vt. 400, 561 A.2d 407 (1989).
       </p>
       <p>
        Driving under the influence with a fatal accident resulting requires the death of a person resulting from the defendant's operation of a vehicle on a highway while under the influence of intoxicating liquor. State v. Poirier, 142 Vt. 595, 458 A.2d 1109 (1983).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since an essential element of the crime of driving under the influence with a fatal accident resulting is that the defendant be under the influence of intoxicating liquor, while the crime of manslaughter does not require this element, trial court did not err in denying motion of defendant, charged with both crimes, to require the State to elect between the charges, although the same act gave rise to each.

        Any confusion as to which of three DUI convictions jury weighed in its deliberations was harmless, and therefore court was not required to decide whether earliest conviction should have been excluded, since statute required only two prior convictions for enhanced penalties to apply and defendant's two later convictions were admissible under statute's amended "forgiveness period," because they were less than fifteen years old. State v. Carpenter, 170 Vt. 371, 749 A.2d 1137 (2000).

        The Supreme Court's interpretation of the Public Defender Act, announced in State v. DeRosa, 161 Vt. 78, 633 A.2d 277 (1993), which held that when a trial judge denies counsel to an indigent defendant because a sentence of imprisonment will not be imposed, the trial judge may not impose on the defendant a conditionally suspended sentence and probation, applies to earlier convictions (i.e., convictions which were final before DeRosa was decided) that may be used for enhancement purposes under a recidivist statute such as subsec. (d). State v. Brown, 165 Vt. 79, 676 A.2d 350 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        A prior conviction for which an indigent defendant was denied counsel and sentenced to a suspended sentence may not be used for enhancement purposes, whether or not the defendant was actually imprisoned for the offense. State v. Brown, 165 Vt. 79, 676 A.2d 350 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Prior uncounseled convictions, including those where the defendant was sentenced to a suspended sentence, may be used for sentence enhancement purposes where the defendant validly waived his right to counsel. State v. Brown, 165 Vt. 79, 676 A.2d 350 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        To challenge the use of a prior conviction for sentence enhancement purposes, a defendant must affirmatively show that counsel was denied improperly, and may not simply rely on a record indicating that counsel was denied and a suspended sentence imposed. State v. Brown, 165 Vt. 79, 676 A.2d 350 (1996).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court did not err in finding that defendant's three prior DUI convictions were valid, raising the offense charged to a felony, where State presented credible evidence disputing defendant's claim that at a change of plea hearing for one of the prior offenses the judge indicated that his conviction would be treated as a first offense and defendant's testimony was insufficient to suggest the existence of any defect. State v. Tatro, 161 Vt. 182, 635 A.2d 1204 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        Where defendant offered no evidence to refute the validity of his prior DUI convictions, the prior convictions were validly factored in to the determination of defendant's enhanced sentence. State v. Tatro, 161 Vt. 182, 635 A.2d 1204 (1993).
       </p>
       <p>
        In the case of defendant found guilty of manslaughter, driving under the influence with a fatal accident resulting, driving while license suspended, and driving while intoxicated with injuries resulting, where the State introduced evidence that after the accident defendant showed physical characteristics symptomatic of intoxication, that a breath test taken at the police station showed a blood-alcohol content of 0.26 percent, that he struck a motorcycle head-on in the motorcycle's lane of traffic, and that as a result of the collision the motorcycle driver was killed and a passenger injured, the jury was justified in finding defendant guilty beyond a reasonable doubt on all four counts; therefore, defendant's motion for judgment of acquittal was properly denied. State v. Poirier, 142 Vt. 595, 458 A.2d 1109 (1983).

       <p>
        Defendant failed to establish that trial court abused its discretion in granting new trial on conviction of driving motor vehicle under influence of alcohol while leaving intact jury finding in separate proceeding of defendant's liability to enhanced punishment as subsequent offender where improper prosecutorial comments which necessitated reversal of DUI conviction could not have prejudiced enhancement phase of proceedings and defendant offered no evidence to counter State's enhancement case. State v. Baril, 155 Vt. 344, 583 A.2d 621 (1990).
       </p>
       <p>
        At bifurcated trial in which substantive charge of driving motor vehicle under the influence of alcohol was adjudicated prior to separate proceeding to determine defendant's liability for enhanced punishment as a subsequent offender, trial court acted within its authority in ordering new trial on substantive offense, on basis of prosecutor's improper closing arguments, while leaving intact jury's finding from enhancement phase of trial for use if defendant were found guilty on retrial.

        At trial for driving under the influence, death resulting, where evidence was admitted that victim had made several suicide attempts during a two-week period before the accident and that her behavior contributed in large measure to her demise, but evidence pointed to fault on defendant's part in failing to see and appreciate the decedent's plight and to take defensive measures to avoid hitting her, the jury could reasonably have concluded that defendant's actions were the cause of death, not merely a cause of death. State v. Papazoni, 157 Vt. 337, 596 A.2d 1276 (1991).
       </p>
       <p>
        In trial for driving under the influence, death resulting, although the evidence of causation, the nexus between defendant's intoxicated state and the collision, was not strong, taken in the light most favorable to the State and excluding modifying evidence, there was sufficient evidence to fairly and reasonably support a finding of proximate cause beyond a reasonable doubt.

       <p>
        Savings clause accompanying 1991 amendment to drunk driving penalty statute was not available to defendant, who had already been convicted of driving under the influence (DUI) three times prior to 1991, and therefore District Court erred in dismissing charge of DUI, fifth offense and amending charge to DUI, second offense. State v. LeBlanc, 171 Vt. 88, 759 A.2d 991 (2000).
       </p>
       <p>
        Because only one of defendant's prior DUI convictions occurred before 1991, he had no right to fifteen-year forgiveness period specified in savings clause, and therefore he could properly be convicted of DUI, third offense, even though more than fifteen years had elapsed between his first conviction and the date his third offense was allegedly committed.

         9. Prior convictions.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        There was no plain error with respect to the trial court's use of defendant's prior DUI conviction for purposes of sentence enhancement as to his second DUI conviction, as he did not challenge the prior DUI conviction, but rather how it was established and accepted by the trial court, such that no prejudice was shown. State v. Bangoura, 205 Vt. 36, 171 A.3d 50 (June 9, 2017).
       </p>
       <p>
        Plain language of the statute allows the same prior driving-under-the-influence conviction to be used both as an element of criminal refusal and to enhance the penalty for the refusal. State v. Wainwright, 195 Vt. 370, 88 A.3d 423 (2013).
       </p>
       <p>
        Under the statutory scheme, the recidivist penalties apply to all successive violations of the driving-under-the-influence statute, regardless of the type. Therefore, although a criminal refusal might be defendant's first such offense, it was a successive violation of the DUI statute, and therefore the recidivist penalties applied. State v. Wainwright, 195 Vt. 370, 88 A.3d 423 (2013).

        Driving-under-the-influence penalty statute does not contain the additional requirement that one of the convictions cannot be a conviction for criminal refusal, at least if it is the first such conviction. Absent such an indication, the Vermont Supreme Court will not impose this added restriction to implementation of the statute. State v. Wainwright, 195 Vt. 370, 88 A.3d 423 (2013).

        Any absence of adequate State supervision of motor vehicle inspection stations and inspections had no relevancy to liability to fine of defendant found guilty of driving uninspected vehicle. State v. Diamondstone, 132 Vt. 303, 318 A.2d 654 (1974).
       </p>
       <p>
        Defendant found guilty of operating uninspected motor vehicle presented nothing for Supreme Court's consideration to condemn inspection law on the alleged grounds that it is an improper delegation of power to private enterprises and has no practical relation to community health and safety. State v. Diamondstone, 132 Vt. 303, 318 A.2d 654 (1974).

        Defendant found guilty of operating uninspected motor vehicle could take nothing from complaint that police should have prevented him from operating the vehicle rather than giving him a ticket. State v. Diamondstone, 132 Vt. 303, 318 A.2d 654 (1974).

       </h5>
       <p>
        Where there was a reasonable possibility that defendants were committing the offense of operating a vehicle without a valid inspection certification, this situation, and the fact that both vehicles were stopped after dark, making a passing examination of the date of the vehicles' current inspection certification difficult or impossible, were sufficient to establish a reasonable and articulable suspicion that a traffic offense was being committed and, as such, the officers legally stopped defendants' vehicles in order to investigate possible wrongdoing. State v. Thompson, 175 Vt. 470, 816 A.2d 550 (mem.) (2002).
       </p>
       <p>
        Officers legally stopped defendants' vehicles in order to investigate possible wrongdoing because defendants did not meet requirements of the Vermont Periodic Inspection Manual, i.e., that any motor vehicle manufactured or assembled with a bumper must have a bumper, and that any motor vehicle manufactured or assembled with a driver's side rearview mirror must have such a mirror, and therefore there was a reasonable possibility that defendants were committing a traffic offense - operating a vehicle without a valid inspection certification. State v. Thompson, 174 Vt. 172, 807 A.2d 454 (mem.) (2002).

        Where defendant was convicted of knowingly operating a motor vehicle to which an unassigned certificate of inspection was attached in violation of this section, since the vehicle was registered to defendant's wife, the sticker was ripped, its back side, which faced the driver, was completely devoid of any markings indicating the date or place of issuance, nor did the sticker show the month of next inspection, as required by section 1222 of this title, governing inspection of registered vehicles, there was ample circumstantial evidence from which the trial court could infer that defendant knew of the invalidity of the affixed sticker.

         1. Constitutionality.

       </h5>
       <p>
        Motorcycle helmet law is entitled to presumption of constitutionality. Benning v. State, 161 Vt. 472, 641 A.2d 757 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        There is no heightened concerns for personal liberty embedded in the Vermont Constitution that would render motorcycle helmet law unconstitutional. Benning v. State, 161 Vt. 472, 641 A.2d 757 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Link between safety for highway users and motorcycle helmet law is rational, since it minimizes the extent of injuries for which government or individuals are financially responsible. Benning v. State, 161 Vt. 472, 641 A.2d 757 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Motorcycle helmet law is not void for vagueness, since statute clearly proscribes failure to wear a helmet and "approved helmet" standards were sufficiently defined or ascertainable. Benning v. State, 161 Vt. 472, 641 A.2d 757 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        In equal protection challenge to motorcycle helmet law, there is rational basis between motorcyclists and automobile drivers, whose vehicles afford them substantially more protection than does a motorcycle; there is also rational basis for distinction between motorcyclists and moped riders, since the latter travel at a lower rate of speed and are forbidden from riding on State highways. Benning v. State, 161 Vt. 472, 641 A.2d 757 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        It lies within power of the Legislature to adopt reasonable measures for the promotion of safety upon the public highways in the interests of motorists and motorcyclists and others who may use them. State v. Solomon, 128 Vt. 197, 260 A.2d 377 (1969).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section applies to all motorcyclists equally, is directly related to highway safety, bears a real and substantial relation to the promotion of the welfare and safety of the general public as distinguished from the welfare solely of the individual motorcycle riders, did not deprive operator convicted of failure to wear protective headgear of his liberty, or restrain his person or actions, is a reasonable requirement, to be observed so that the public safety will not be jeopardized, and as legislation intended to protect persons in other vehicles from exposure to danger created by a motorcycle out of control, is clearly within the State's police power and in no way violates the State or Federal Constitution. State v. Solomon, 128 Vt. 197, 260 A.2d 377 (1969).

Except as provided in subsection (c) of this section, a copy shall also be available in the towing vehicle and must be available for inspection on demand of a law enforcement officer. Before operating a traction engine, tractor, trailer, motor truck, or other motor vehicle, the person to whom a permit to operate in excess of the weight, width, indivisible overlength, and height limits established by this title is granted shall pay a fee of $40.00 for each single trip permit or $112.00 for a blanket permit, except that the fee for a fleet blanket permit shall be $112.00 for the first unit and $6.00 for each unit thereafter. At the option of a carrier, an annual permit for the entire fleet, to operate over any approved route, may be obtained for $112.00 for the first tractor and $6.00 for each additional tractor, up to a maximum fee of $1,000.00. The fee for a fleet permit shall be based on the entire number of tractors owned by the applicant. An applicant for a fleet permit may apply for any number of specific routes, each of which shall be reviewed with regard to the characteristics of the route and the type of equipment operated by the applicant. When the weight or size of the vehicle-load are considered sufficiently excessive for the routing requested, the Agency of Transportation shall, on request of the Commissioner, conduct an engineering inspection of the vehicle-load and route, for which a fee of $300.00 will be added to the cost of the permit if the load is a manufactured home. For all other loads of any size or with gross weight limits less than 150,000 pounds, the fee shall be $800.00 for any engineering inspection that requires up to eight hours to conduct. If the inspection requires more than eight hours to conduct, the fee shall be $800.00 plus $60.00 per hour for each additional hour required. If the vehicle and load weigh 150,000 pounds or more but not more than 200,000 pounds, the engineering inspection fee shall be $2,000.00. If the vehicle and load weigh more than 200,000 pounds but not more than 250,000 pounds, the engineering inspection fee shall be $5,000.00. If the vehicle and load weigh more than 250,000 pounds, the engineering inspection fee shall be $10,000.00. The study must be completed prior to the permit being issued. Prior to the issuance of a permit, an applicant whose vehicle weighs 150,000 pounds or more, or is 15 or more feet in width or height, shall file with the Commissioner a special certificate of insurance showing minimum coverage of $250,000.00 for death or injury to one person, $500,000.00 for death or injury to two or more persons, and $250,000.00 for property damage, all arising out of any one crash.

A prepayment shall be credited to the account of the person making the prepayment and the account shall be reduced to the extent of any fees due from that person under this section; provided, however, fees may not be charged to the account in excess of the account balance. Upon oral application of any person having prepaid fees, the Commissioner may issue a permit with an identifying number, and the permit shall become effective immediately. Upon application, the Commissioner shall return any unused portion of the prepayment to the person originally making the prepayment.

In that event, the Agency of Transportation shall review the route or routes requested, making its determination for approval based on safety and engineering considerations, after considering input from local government and regional planning commissions or the metropolitan planning organization. The Agency shall maintain consistency in its application of acceptable highway geometry when approving other routes. The Agency may authorize safety precautions on these highways, if warranted, which shall include precautionary signage, intelligent transportation system signage, special speed limits, and use of flashing lights.

        A person who aids in the commission of the offense of driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol may be held criminally liable for the acts of the principal. State v. Millette, 173 Vt. 596, 795 A.2d 1182 (mem.) (2002).

        There was insufficient evidence to establish that defendant aided in the commission of a driving a motor vehicle while under the influence of alcohol based on facts that, when defendant exited the bar, he was aware that he and his friend had consumed too much alcohol to drive safely, defendant attempted to persuade his friend that they should sleep in the car rather than drive home, and his friend took the keys from defendant's pocket.

       The text of this section is based on the harmonization of two amendments. During the 1983 Adjourned Session, this section was amended twice, by Act Nos. 104 and 141, resulting in two versions of this section. In order to reflect all of the changes enacted by the Legislature during the 1983 Adjourned Session, the text of Act Nos. 104 and 141 was merged to arrive at a single version of this section. The changes that each of the amendments made are described in the amendment notes set out below.

        Decedent's 2006 registration application did not effectively transfer an interest in the vehicle to appellant, his daughter. Form VD-119 on its own did not purport to serve as a legal mechanism for the transfer of ownership; the decedent failed to assign an interest in the vehicle to appellant in the space provided on the title certificate; and there was no evidence of a bill of sale recording the decedent's transfer of an interest in the vehicle to appellant.

     <p>
      If a dealer buys a vehicle, holds it for resale, and obtains the certificate of title from the owner or the lienholder, then the certificate need not be sent to the Commissioner. When the dealer transfers the vehicle to a person, other than by the creation of a security interest, he or she shall simultaneously execute the assignment and warranty of title by filling in the spaces on the certificate of title or as prescribed by the Commissioner or, if title is held by a finance source, execute a form prescribed by the Commissioner that provides proof of the transfer but does not release the lien. The certificate shall be mailed or delivered to the Commissioner with the transferee's application for a new certificate.

        It was not error for a bankruptcy court to conclude that a creditor's interest was unsecured because the prior lienholder properly returned the certificate of title to the debtor and the creditor did not take any affirmative steps to assure that its security interest in the debtor's commercial truck was protected.

        A creditor perfects its security interest in a vehicle by delivering an application for a certificate of title in accordance with subsec. (b) of this section, despite a clerical failure to note the encumbrance on the title. In re Farnham, 57 B.R. 241 (Bankr. D. Vt. 1986).

        A security interest in a vehicle is perfected once the creditor has presented the proper application for a certificate of title; a clerk's erroneous omission of the lienholder's name on the certificate of title will not defeat perfection of the lien.

       <p>
        In view of explicit statutory commands regarding what is essential for the creation and perfection of a security interest in a previously registered motor vehicle, reliance on principles and precepts of the Uniform Commercial Code relative to the subject is misplaced.

        The wording of this section indicates that to the extent that they are inconsistent with the provisions of this subchapter, provisions of the Uniform Commercial Code governing perfection of security interests have been superseded by this subchapter. 1970-72 Op. Atty. Gen. 348.

      In the case of motor vehicles or trailers, notwithstanding any other provision of law, a transaction does not create a sale or security interest merely because it provides that the rental price is permitted or required to be adjusted under the agreement either upward or downward by reference to the amount realized upon sale or other disposition of the motor vehicle or trailer.

       <p>
        Requiring a seller to refund the purchase price under the salvage title law without receiving the car in return would be a windfall for the buyer. Therefore, at the buyer's election, either the seller had to reimburse the buyer for the purchase price of the car, along with taxes and fees, in exchange for the return of the car, or the buyer could keep the car and the seller had to prove the actual value of the car as a salvaged vehicle and reimburse him for the difference between his purchase price and the newly established value. Gregory v. Poulin Auto Sales, Inc., 188 Vt. 619, 9 A.3d 679 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        Trial court erred in finding that buyer intended to keep car where buyer took car back to dealership and demanded immediate refund of purchase price together with cost of his repairs, and when buyer did not obtain satisfaction, he took car with him and had his attorney write and advise dealership that he was revoking acceptance and would return car at time and place that was mutually convenient. Jensvold v. Town & Country Motors, Inc., 162 Vt. 580, 649 A.2d 1037 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        After offer to tender vehicle for refund is rejected, buyer's use of vehicle does not nullify offer, otherwise any seller could deprive buyer of refund remedy under Salvage Title Act by refusing to refund purchase price and forcing buyer to retain vehicle. Jensvold v. Town & Country Motors, Inc., 162 Vt. 580, 649 A.2d 1037 (1994).
       </p>
       <p>
        Buyer's visit to dealership, to demand immediate refund of purchase price together with cost of repairs, and attorney's letter were each independently sufficient to notify seller that buyer did not want vehicle and did not desire to retain it. Jensvold v. Town & Country Motors, Inc., 162 Vt. 580, 649 A.2d 1037 (1994).
       </p>

        Buyer was entitled to refund of purchase price, taxes, license fees, and similar governmental charges where seller knew vehicle was "clipped" but did not disclose that fact to buyer. Jensvold v. Town & Country Motors, Inc., 162 Vt. 580, 649 A.2d 1037 (1994).

       <p>
        Nothing in the salvage title law suggests protection for an innocent seller nor requires that the seller be aware of any defect; the application of the statute is not predicated on the seller's knowledge of any title defects. Accordingly, there was no merit to a seller's argument that there was no violation of the statute because the seller had no knowledge that the car it sold was salvaged. Gregory v. Poulin Auto Sales, Inc., 188 Vt. 619, 9 A.3d 679 (mem.) (2010).
       </p>
       <p>
        There was no merit to a seller's argument that the car it sold did not fall under the purview of the salvage title statute because the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV) had failed to issue a salvage title. While the statute laid out facets of the inspection the DMV had to undertake before issuing a salvage title, it placed any liability and all responsibility squarely on the seller; the question was the condition of the vehicle and the demand for a refund, not the status of the title. Gregory v. Poulin Auto Sales, Inc., 188 Vt. 619, 9 A.3d 679 (mem.) (2010).

         1. Constitutionality.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        This section is not constitutionally infirm because of its failure to require a hearing prior to suspension of motor vehicle operator's license, since Due Process Clause does not require that Vermont provide a separate presuspension hearing determining degree of hardship suspension will cause to motorists who face possible suspension of their operator's licenses; opportunity to contest the actual traffic offense in court provides the motorist with a hearing which is sufficient to meet due process standards. Calabi v. Malloy, 438 F. Supp. 1165 (D. Vt. 1977), judgment amended, 468 F. Supp. 76 (D. Vt. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        This section does not violate Equal Protection Clause since rational basis exists for providing presuspension hearings for Vermont licensees who have been convicted of motor vehicle offenses in other states and who are deemed improper or incompetent to operate motor vehicles, while denying presuspension hearings for Vermont licensees convicted of traffic offense in Vermont; those convicted of traffic offenses outside Vermont who are provided with presuspension hearings would otherwise have no opportunity to be heard in Vermont, while those traffic offenders inside Vermont who are denied presuspension hearings retain the right to a full judicial hearing in Vermont on the facts underlying the charges against them. Calabi v. Malloy, 438 F. Supp. 1165 (D. Vt. 1977), judgment amended, 468 F. Supp. 76 (D. Vt. 1978).
       </p>
       <p>
        Since Commissioner's procedural guidelines, administered in suspending motor vehicle operator's licenses, are reasonably specific and ascertainable and prescribe suspensions which are both within the statutory maximum and within normally acceptable limits, the scheme of this section does not unconstitutionally fail to provide standards for the exercise of administrative discretion. Calabi v. Malloy, 438 F. Supp. 1165 (D. Vt. 1977), judgment amended, 468 F. Supp. 76 (D. Vt. 1978).

         2. Fines.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Fifty dollar fine for operating uninspected motor vehicle was not excessive as to defendant claiming penalty provision violated Fourteenth Amendment as it imposed a fine without reference to violator's income, and did not violate his equal protection rights.

         3. Jury trial.
        </b>

        Driving without insurance is a civil infraction, rather than a criminal offense, under Vermont law; the sanctions imposed for driving without insurance in Vermont are not sufficiently punitive as to transform the offense from a civil, regulatory violation into a criminal one.

        Change in law that reclassified as a civil violation, rather than a criminal offense, the operation of a motor vehicle with a suspended license after suspension period had expired and prior to reinstatement was applied retroactively since the change did not remove all liability for violative conduct.

       For the purpose of identifying habitually reckless or negligent drivers and frequent violators of traffic regulations governing the movement of vehicles, a uniform system is established assigning demerit points for convictions of violations of this title or of ordinances adopted by local authorities regulating the operation of motor vehicles. Notice of each assessment of points may be given. No points shall be assessed for violating a provision of a statute or municipal ordinance regulating standing, parking, equipment, size, or weight, or if a Superior judge or Judicial Bureau hearing officer has waived the assessment of points in the interest of justice and in accordance with subsection (b) of this section. The conviction report from the court shall be prima facie evidence of the points assessed unless points are specifically waived in the conviction report. The Department of Motor Vehicles also is authorized to suspend the license of a driver when the driver's driving record identifies the driver as a habitual offender under section 673a of this title.

      When a sufficient number of points has been acquired, the Commissioner shall suspend the license of an operator or the privilege of an unlicensed individual or nonresident to operate a motor vehicle, upon not less than 10 days' notice, and upon hearing, if requested for verification of the conviction records. The suspension shall be for 10 days for an accumulation of 10 points, 30 days for 15 points, 90 days for 20 points, and for a period increasing by 30 days for each additional 5 points; except the suspension period for a conviction for first offense of sections 1091, 1094, 1128, and 1133 of this title shall be 30 days, for a second conviction 90 days, and for a third or subsequent six months, or the suspension period under the point values, whichever is greater. If a fatality occurs, the suspension shall be for a period of one year in addition to the suspension under the point values. For purposes of this section, a month equals 30 days and one year equals 365 days.

       Before commencing business, on application, a distributor shall first procure a license from the Commissioner permitting him or her to continue or to engage in business as a distributor. Before the Commissioner issues a license, the distributor shall file with the Commissioner a surety bond in a form and with sureties as the Commissioner may require for a sum based on an estimate of the tax liability for a two-month period, but not to exceed $700,000.00, conditioned upon the issuance of the report and the payment of the tax, penalties, and fines provided in this subchapter. Upon approval of the application and bond, the Commissioner shall issue to the distributor a nonassignable license that shall continue in force until surrendered or revoked.

If the Commissioner determines that release or reduction of the bond will not unreasonably jeopardize State revenues, the bond shall be released or reduced, notwithstanding subdivision (1) of this subsection.
    Upon a finding to the contrary, the Commissioner shall retain the bond.
    If a bond is released or reduced under this subdivision, the Commissioner may reimpose a bond or increase the bond in accordance with subdivision (1) of this subsection if he or she determines that a material change in circumstances has occurred and State revenues will be unreasonably jeopardized without the reimposition or increase.
    A distributor aggrieved by a decision of the Commissioner to retain, reimpose, or increase a bond may request a hearing, which shall be conducted in accordance with sections
    105-107 of this title, and appeals shall be governed by section 3115 of this chapter.

       The text of subsec. (b) of this section is based on the harmonization of two amendments. During the 2001 Adjourned Session, subsec.

In order to reflect all of the changes enacted by the Legislature during the 2001 Adjourned Session, the text of Act Nos. 75 and 143 was merged to arrive at a single version of subsec. (b). The changes that each of the amendments made are described in the amendment notes set out below.

        Where a defendant's unlawful act is established in the chain of direct legal causation, he is criminally responsible for the course of events which naturally follow from that act, unless the act of another breaks the chain of causation of the original negligent actor. Thus, in a boating-while-intoxicated case which resulted in two deaths, the trial court correctly instructed that defendant's actions had to be a cause, rather than the sole cause, of the accident. State v. Martin, 182 Vt. 377, 944 A.2d 867 (Sept. 7, 2007).

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        In a prosecution for boating while intoxicated, although there was no direct evidence of the precise global positioning system (GPS) location of the boat at the moment it capsized, the State's evidence, which included GPS recordings based on the recollections of three rescuers who were found to be credible, unbiased, and confident in their recollections, was sufficient for the trial court to infer beyond a reasonable doubt that the boat was in Vermont waters at the time of the capsize. State v. Martin, 182 Vt. 377, 944 A.2d 867 (Sept. 7, 2007).
       </p>
       <p>
        In a boating-while-intoxicated case, the trial court did not unconstitutionally shift the burden of proof to defendant to establish where the boat was at the time of capsize. The trial court expressly found that the State had established beyond a reasonable doubt that the boat capsized within the boundaries of the State of Vermont, and its statement that there was "insufficient evidence to tie the defense expert's general information about lake currents to the particular time and place at issue here" was in the context of its explanation of why it did not credit defendant's evidence over the State's evidence. State v. Martin, 182 Vt. 377, 944 A.2d 867 (Sept. 7, 2007).

         3. Multiple convictions.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Multiple convictions are prohibited for a violation of the first section of the boating-while-intoxicated statute, for just as the statute prohibiting grossly negligent operation of a motor vehicle defines the prohibited act "solely by reference to the standard of care required of drivers," with enhanced sentence provisions depending on the consequences, the act prohibited by the boating-while-intoxicated statute is defined solely by the operation of a vessel while intoxicated, with enhanced sentencing provisions depending on the consequences. Because death resulting was not included in the actus reus - the criminalized conduct of the offense - defendant's second conviction could not stand when two children had died in the boating accident he caused. State v. Martin, 182 Vt. 377, 944 A.2d 867 (Sept. 7, 2007).

     Construing the Driver License Compact and statute requiring Commissioner of Motor Vehicles to give persons notice and opportunity to be heard prior to revocation or suspension of a Vermont operator's license based on out-of-state convictions, the statutes are best harmonized by giving effect to the provisions of each; therefore, notice and opportunity to be heard are required prior to such revocations or suspensions.

    <p>
     Where plaintiff was convicted for out-of-state instance of DUI subsequent to enactment of Driver License Compact and to amendment of statute to allow out-of-state convictions to be used to calculate subsequent convictions for purposes of license suspension and revocation, fact that newly enacted and amended statutes were applied to add out-of-state conviction to previous Vermont conviction did not constitute impermissible ex post facto application of statutes; statutory amendments would have had no impact on plaintiff absent a new act by him (the out-of-state conviction) which triggered the new rule.

      The purpose of this chapter is to implement 49 U.S.C. ch. 313, as may be amended, and the federal Commercial Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1986, Title XII of Pub. L. No. 99-570, as amended, and reduce or prevent commercial motor vehicle accidents, fatalities, and injuries by permitting commercial drivers to hold only one license, disqualifying commercial drivers who have committed certain criminal or other offenses or serious traffic violations, and strengthening licensing and testing standards. This chapter is a remedial law and shall be liberally construed to promote the public health, safety, and welfare. To the extent that this chapter conflicts with general operator licensing provisions, this chapter prevails. Where this chapter is silent, the general operator licensing provisions apply.
