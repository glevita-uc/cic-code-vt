       <p>
        The superior court was without authority to consider the visitation petition of plaintiff, the female partner of a child's adoptive mother, as it was without equitable powers to adjudicate a dispute that could not be brought in statutory proceedings within the family court's jurisdiction, there being no public policy considerations which compelled a judicially created right of equitable adoption. Were such a right created, it would establish, in effect, a two-tiered system in which persons who could not bring their visitation and custody petitions in statutory proceedings before the family court would turn to the superior court for relief. The Legislature did not contemplate such a system, and the law does not compel it. Titchenal v. Dexter, 166 Vt. 373, 693 A.2d 682 (1997).

        §
        448, where two sisters, who were similarly situated except that one was adopted as a child, were treated differently in regard to their rights of inheritance from collateral kin, the classification was based on an impermissible premise that the adopted child was a second-class member of the adoptive family, the discriminatory application of former 15 V.S.A.

        448 was not reasonably related to a valid public purpose, and the section was unconstitutional insofar as it denied adopted children the right to inherit from collateral relatives. MacCallum v. Seymour's Administrator, 165 Vt. 452, 686 A.2d 935 (1996).

       <p>
        The superior court was without authority to consider the visitation petition of plaintiff, the female partner of a child's adoptive mother, as it was without equitable powers to adjudicate a dispute that could not be brought in statutory proceedings within the family court's jurisdiction, there being no public policy considerations which compelled a judicially created right of equitable adoption. Were such a right created, it would establish, in effect, a two-tiered system in which persons who could not bring their visitation and custody petitions in statutory proceedings before the family court would turn to the superior court for relief. The Legislature did not contemplate such a system, and the law does not compel it. Titchenal v. Dexter, 166 Vt. 373, 693 A.2d 682 (1997).

       <p>
        Requirement of probate court, in its rules of procedure, that the commissioner of social welfare sign consent to an adoption petition at the time of its filing, where his department has the minor in question in charge, is not in conflict with statutory law and does not appear to be so unreasonable as to constitute an abuse of authority on the part of the court. 1952-54 Op.

         2. Abandonment.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Burden of proving abandonment requires a showing of absolute, complete and intentional abandonment. In re Bingham, 149 Vt. 211, 541 A.2d 1197 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Probate court's finding that minor children visited the home of their paternal grandparents and that their father saw the children and was with them during those visits adequately supported its determination that the father had not "abandoned the care and support " of his children within the contemplation of subdivision (1) of this section. In re Bingham, 149 Vt. 211, 541 A.2d 1197 (1988).
       </p>
       <p>
        Abandonment or desertion within purview of this section must be absolute, complete and intentional. Whitton v. Scott, 120 Vt. 452, 144 A.2d 706 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        Abandonment of child imports may conduct on part of parent which evinces settled purpose to forego all parental duties and relinquish all parental claims to child. Whitton v. Scott, 120 Vt. 452, 144 A.2d 706 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        Whether abandonment of child rendering unnecessary parent's consent to adoption exists is question of fact, depending largely on parent's intention, to be determined on competent evidence after notice to parents. Whitton v. Scott, 120 Vt. 452, 144 A.2d 706 (1958).
       </p>
       <p>
        Issue of abandonment would have to be decided by probate court in order to authorize department of social welfare to give consent to adoption of child under subdivision (5) of this section. 1962-64 Op. Atty. Gen. 318.

         3. Consent by state agency.
        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        Department of social welfare may not consent to an adoption based on initial commitment order awarding custody of child to that department in absence of statement on mittimus that such custody is given without limitation in respect to adoption. 1962-64 Op. Atty. Gen. 318.
       </p>
       <p>
        Subdivision (6) of this section requires a decision by juvenile court, after hearing, that child may be placed for adoption, and juvenile court should modify mittimus of commitment to department of social welfare to show that custody is given to department "without limitation in respect to adoption" only after such finding. 1962-64 Op. Atty. Gen. 318.

        </b>
       </h5>
       <p>
        The father of a child born out of wedlock has a due process right to notice and an opportunity to appear when the child is to be placed for adoption and the state may not take any action in an adoption proceeding which denies such right and must be prepared to prove that a person named as the putative father has been duly served notice, or that the identity of the father was not known and could not be established through reasonable inquiry, and that the best interests of the child require termination of parental rights and placement for adoption; for failure of the state to take such steps when the mother does not know or will not disclose the father's name constitutes state action denying due process. 1972-74 Op. Atty. Gen. 230.
       </p>
       <p>
        Juvenile court should give notice to natural parents of child prior to rehearing which is necessary for modification of mittimus awarding custody of child to department of social welfare which indicates that custody is given to such department without limitation in respect to adoption. 1962-64 Op.

        Where court which determined that two children were in need of care and supervision concluded that the mother's residual parental rights should be terminated but declined to do so on the grounds that no notice of the proceedings had been given to the putative fathers of the children and this section, which
    would bar them from receiving notice of any future adoption
    proceedings, would violate their constitutional rights, the
    court's disposition order would be amended to terminate the
    mother's residual parental rights, since the putative fathers
    had never had custody and therefore could not be deprived of
    their custodial rights, they were not being deprived of their
    residual parental rights because the order would terminate only the parental rights of the mother and the proper time to test the constitutionality of this section would be when and if adoption proceedings were instituted. In re T.L.S., 144 Vt. 536, 481 A.2d 1037 (1984).

        If words "without limitation in respect to adoption" are interpreted so that silence on the part of juvenile court in committing child to custody of department of social welfare would confer authority on such department to assent to adoption of child without further action by juvenile court to indicate such removal of limitations on mittimus of commitment, natural parents would be denied notice of adoption hearing under this section. 1962-64 Op.

        Appeal from probate court order denying termination of parental rights was transferred to superior court; question whether existence of guardianship constituted good cause for parents' nonsupport of minors, although framed as a question of law, necessarily required careful review of record as a whole and particular facts and circumstances of case, and was therefore beyond supreme court's jurisdiction.

        Question whether probate court adequately addressed requisite statutory criteria in determining whether termination of parental rights was in best interests of children was beyond scope of supreme court's appellate review, since it would involve considering evidentiary record as a whole, which was precisely the type of fact-specific issue reserved for probate court in the first instance, and for superior court on de novo review.

        Father's failure to make support payments to the child's grandfather was not, alone, a failure to "exercise parental responsibility" within the meaning of the termination of parental rights statute. The trial court found that the grandfather would not have accepted payments had the father attempted to make them, that no formal order for child support was ever put in place that the father ignored, and that the child was financially supported in the guardianship by the State through the Department for Children and Families. In re K.M.M., 189 Vt. 372, 22 A.3d 423 (2011).

       </h5>
       <p>
        There was no merit to a grandfather's argument that a child's father failed to regularly communicate or visit with the child. The trial court's findings supported the view that the father would have regularly communicated or visited with the child had he been given the opportunity to do so; the father's limited involvement over the years was, in large part, due to the grandfather's refusal to allow increased contact between the father and his daughter.

        Trial court's conclusion that a father manifested an ability and willingness to assume legal and physical custody was clearly supported by its findings. The trial court specifically cited its findings regarding a family services report; furthermore, its findings about the father's positive behavior and interactions with the child, along with his continued support of his termination of guardianship petition - first filed just months after the guardianship was established - also supported the trial court's conclusion concerning this factor.

       An adoptive parent may petition the court to modify or terminate a postadoption contact agreement entered into under <cite class="vt-code">33 V.S.A. § 5124</cite> if the adoptive parent believes the best interests of the child are being compromised by the terms of the agreement. In an action brought under this section, the burden of proof shall be on the adoptive parent to show by clear and convincing evidence that the modification or termination of the agreement is in the best interests of the child.

       A former parent may petition for enforcement of a postadoption contact agreement entered into under <cite class="vt-code">33 V.S.A. § 5124</cite> if the adoptive parent is not in compliance with the terms of the agreement. In an action brought under this section, the burden of proof shall be on the former parent to show by a preponderance of the evidence that enforcement of the agreement is in the best interests of the child.

       A disagreement between the parties or litigation brought to enforce or modify the agreement shall not affect the validity of the termination of parental rights or the adoption.

       The court shall not act on a petition to modify or enforce the agreement unless the petitioner had in good faith participated or attempted to participate in mediation or alternative dispute resolution proceedings to resolve the dispute prior to bringing the petition for enforcement.

      <li id="t15c09s9-101ol1e">
       Parties to the proceeding shall be the individuals who signed the original agreement created under <cite class="vt-code">33 V.S.A. § 5124</cite>. The adopted child, if 14 years of age or older, may also participate. The Department for Children and Families shall not be required to be a party to the proceeding and the court shall not order further investigation or evaluation by the Department.

      <li id="t15c09s9-101ol1f">
       The court may order the communication or contact be terminated or modified if the court deems such termination or modification to be in the best interests of the child. In making a best interests determination, the court may consider:

         the protection of the physical safety of the adopted child or other members of the adoptive family;
