        §
        2291(11), allowing towns, cities, and incorporated villages to license and tax amusements and entertainments, must be read in pari materia as they deal with the same subject matter, and under such a reading village trustees could enact an ordinance placing a ten dollar per day license fee on amusements and entertainments.

       Statement of policy and purpose.
      </b>
      This Compact is enacted to implement the operation of Tri-State Lotto, for the purpose of raising additional revenue for each of the party states. Tri-State Lotto is not intended to replace any existing lottery game in the party states, but, rather, to be run in addition to these games. Tri-State Lotto tickets will be sold in each of the party states and processed in a central area to be determined by the Commission. No less than 50 percent of the gross sales from each state will be aggregated in a common prize pool, and operating costs will be charged proportionally to the party states. The remaining revenues generated within each state will remain in that particular state.

        The Tri-State Lotto Commission has the power to promulgate the rules and regulations that govern the lottery game, including the manner of selecting the winning tickets and paying the prizes, and while traditionally the supreme court has been reluctant to substitute its judgment for the experience and expertise of an agency, its overall objective is to give effect to the intent of the legislature; consequently, when interpreting the statutory language of 31 V.S.A.
        §
        674(L)(1) that allows payment to one other than a ticketholder pursuant to an "appropriate judicial order" the court held that the words chosen by the Legislature conveyed a broad power allowing them to authorize payment to persons other than the ticketholder. Lemieux v. Tri-State Lotto Commission, 164 Vt. 110, 666 A.2d 1170 (1995).
       </p>
       <p>
        Given the wide use of lottery legislation that specifically bars assignments, the absence of a provision prohibiting assignments shows that the Legislature purposefully eliminated an express prohibition on the voluntary assignment of lottery proceeds so as to allow for assignments. Lemieux v. Tri-State Lotto Commission, 164 Vt. 110, 666 A.2d 1170 (1995).

        Although the court normally does not interfere with an administrative agency's construction of the statute it administers, the court cannot enforce administrative rules if they are inconsistent with the authorizing statute; consequently, since 31 V.S.A.
        §
        674(L) imposes no limits on when a transfer of lottery winnings can be found appropriate, unlike Tri-State Lottery Commission Rule 11(d) which imposes such limits, Rule 11(d) is inconsistent with the statute, thus unenforceable. Lemieux v. Tri-State Lotto Commission, 164 Vt. 110, 666 A.2d 1170 (1995).
