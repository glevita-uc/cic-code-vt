      Because the desire for the services provided by libraries transcends governmental boundaries and can most effectively be satisfied by giving such services to communities and people regardless of jurisdictional lines, it is the policy of the states party to this compact to cooperate and share their responsibilities; to authorize cooperation and sharing with respect to those types of library facilities and services which can be more economically or efficiently developed and maintained on a cooperative basis, and to authorize cooperation and sharing among localities, states and others in providing joint or cooperative library services in areas where the distribution of population or of existing and potential library resources make the provision of library service on an interstate basis the most effective way of providing adequate and efficient service.

        Trust providing for mandatory annual payment to town library, and also providing that trustees "may" pay over unexpended trust balance each year upon request of library, did not conflict with provision of subsection (a) of this section giving public trustees of a town library full power to manage the library and receive and manage property coming into the town's hands for the library's use, as the public trustees of the library had power over library funds only after the money came into the town's hands, while the trust's trustees had no control of the trust money after it was paid to the library.

By its own terms, Executive Order No. 35-87
    (No. 3-11) took effect on July 1, 1987, pursuant to section 2002 of Title 3. For the text of Executive Order No. 35-87

     <p>
      A Board of Libraries, referred to in this chapter as "the Board", is established. The Board shall serve in an advisory capacity to the State Librarian. The Board shall consist of seven members appointed by the Governor with the advice and consent of the Senate. At the time of appointment of the initial Board, one member shall be appointed for a term of one year, two members for terms of two years, two for three years, and two for four years. Thereafter, all appointments shall be for a term of four years. The Governor may appoint a member to replace any member of the Board who dies or resigns, to serve for the balance of the unexpired term of office. No person shall be appointed to the Board for more than two full terms, consecutive or otherwise. In making appointments to the Board, the Governor shall, as the Governor finds feasible, consult with educational officials, librarians and library administrators, the Vermont Bar Association, or other segments of the population.

In all cases where property is conveyed, it shall be subject to rights of access, public visitation, and other conditions or restrictions of operation, maintenance, restoration, and repair that the Division may prescribe or may be agreed upon between the Division and the grantee or lessee to accomplish the purposes of this section.
